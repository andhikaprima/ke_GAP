AB Overexploitation threatens the future of many large vertebrates. In the
   ocean, tunas and sea turtles are current conservation concerns because of
   this intense pressure. The status of most shark species, in contrast,
   remains uncertain. Using the largest data set in the Northwest Atlantic,
   we show rapid large declines in large coastal and oceanic shark
   populations. Scalloped hammerhead, white, and thresher sharks are each
   estimated to have declined by over 75% in the past 15 years. Closed-area
   models highlight priority areas for shark conservation, and the need to
   consider effort reallocation and site selection if marine reserves are to
   benefit multiple threatened species.

AB Whereas many land predators disappeared before their ecological roles
   were studied, the decline of marine apex predators is still unfolding.
   Large sharks in particular have experienced rapid declines over the last
   decades. In this study, we review the documented changes in exploited
   elasmobranch communities in coastal, demersal, and pelagic habitats, and
   synthesize the effects of sharks on their prey and wider communities. We
   show that the high natural diversity and abundance of sharks is
   vulnerable to even light fishing pressure. The decline of large predatory
   sharks reduces natural mortality in a range of prey, contributing to
   changes in abundance, distribution, and behaviour of small elasmobranchs,
   marine mammals, and sea turtles that have few other predators. Through
   direct predation and behavioural modifications, top-down effects of
   sharks have led to cascading changes in some coastal ecosystems. In
   demersal and pelagic communities, there is increasing evidence of
   mesopredator release, but cascading effects are more hypothetical. Here,
   fishing pressure on mesopredators may mask or even reverse some ecosystem
   effects. In conclusion, large sharks can exert strong top-down forces
   with the potential to shape marine communities over large spatial and
   temporal scales. Yet more empirical evidence is needed to test the
   generality of these effects throughout the ocean.

   amendments by 600 firms in the period 1979–1985 has an insignificant
   effect on the value of announcing firms' shares. However, different types
   of amendments have varying effects. Non-fair-price amendments have an
   average significant negative effect of 2.95% on share prices, while
   fair-price amendments have an insignificant effect. The more harmful
   amendments have larger insider holdings and lower institutional holdings,

AB The concept of elasmobranch species using nursery areas was introduced in
   the early 1900s and has been an accepted aspect of shark biology and
   behavior for several decades. Despite several descriptions of how shark
   species use nursery areas and what types of regions nurseries may be
   found in, no explicit definition of what constitutes a shark nursery area
   has been presented. Here we evaluate the assumptions of the current shark
   nursery paradigm in light of available data. Based on examination of
   these assumptions and available methods of quantifying and accurately
   describing shark nursery areas, a new more quantitative definition of
   shark nursery areas is proposed. This definition requires 3 criteria to
   be met for an area to be identified as a nursery: (1) sharks are more
   commonly encountered in the area than other areas; (2) sharks have a
   tendency to remain or return for extended periods; and (3) the area or
   habitat is repeatedly used across years. These criteria make the
   definition of shark nursery areas more compatible with those for other
   aquatic species. The improved definition of this concept will provide
   more valuable information for fisheries managers and shark biologists.

AB Despite growing concerns about overexploitation of sharks, lack of
   accurate, speciesspecific harvest data often hampers quantitative stock
   assessment. In such cases, trade studies can provide insights into
   exploitation unavailable from traditional monitoring. We applied Bayesian
   statistical methods to trade data in combination with genetic
   identification to estimate by species, the annual number of globally
   traded shark fins, the most commercially valuable product from a group of
   species often unrecorded in harvest statistics. Our results provide the
   first fishery-independent estimate of the scale of shark catches
   worldwide and indicate that shark biomass in the fin trade is three to
   four times higher than shark catch figures reported in the only global
   data base. Comparison of our estimates to approximated stock assessment
   reference points for one of the most commonly traded species, blue shark,
   suggests that current trade volumes in numbers of sharks are close to or
   possibly exceeding the maximum sustainable yield levels.

AB Although both food availability and predation risk have been hypothesized
   to affect dolphin habitat use and group size, no study has measured both
   factors concurrently to determine their relative influences. From 1997 to
   1999, we investigated the effect of food availability and tiger shark
   (Galeocerdo cuvier) predation risk on bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops
   aduncus) habitat use and group size in Shark Bay, Western Australia. Food
   availability was measured by fish trapping, while predation risk was
   assessed by shark catch rates, acoustic tracks, and Crittercam
   deployments. Dolphin habitat use was deter- mined using belt transects.
   The biomass of dolphin prey did not vary seasonally and was significantly
   greater in shallow habitats than in deeper ones. Tiger sharks were
   virtually absent during cold months of 1997 and 1998, abundant in warm
   months of all years, and found at an intermediate density during cold
   months of 1999. When present, shark density was highest in shallow
   habitats. Decreased echolocation efficiency in very shallow water and
   poor visual detection of tiger sharks (camouflaged over seagrass)
   probably further enhance the riskiness of such habitats, and the relative
   riskiness of shallow habitats is supported by the observation that
   dolphins select deep waters in which to rest. The observed dolphin group
   sizes were consistent with a food-safety trade-off. Groups were larger in
   more dangerous shallow habitats and larger during resting than during
   foraging. Foraging dolphins matched the distribution of their food when
   sharks were absent. However, during warm months, the distribution of
   foraging dolphins significantly deviated from that of their food, with
   fewer dolphins foraging in the productive (but dangerous) shallow
   habitats than expected on the basis of food alone. When shark density was
   intermediate, habitat use by foraging dolphins was more similar to the
   high-shark-density seasons than periods of low shark density. These
   results suggest that foraging dolphin distributions reflect a trade-off
   between predation risk and food availability. Because the distribution
   and abundance of tiger sharks are influenced by species other than
   dolphins, the distribution of the tiger sharks' primary prey may
   indirectly influence dolphin habitat use, suggesting that it is important
   to consider the community context in studies of habitat use.

AB In recent years, a variety of low molecular weight antibiotics have been
   isolated from diverse animal species. These agents, which include
   peptides, lipids, and alkaloids, exhibit antibiotic activity against
   environmental microbes and are thought to play a role in innate immunity.
   We report here the discovery of a broad-spectrum steroidal antibiotic
   isolated from tissues of the dogfish shark Squalus acanthias. This
   water-soluble antibiotic, which we have named squalamine, exhibits potent
   bactericidal activity against both Gram-negative and Gram-positive
   bacteria. In addition, squalamine is fungicidal and induces osmotic lysis
   of protozoa. The chemical structure of the antibiotic 3
   beta-N-1-(N-[3-(4-aminobutyl)]- 1,3-diaminopropane)-7 alpha,24
   zeta-dihydroxy-5 alpha-cholestane 24-sulfate has been determined by fast
   atom bombardment mass spectroscopy and NMR. Squalamine is a cationic
   steroid characterized by a condensation of an anionic bile salt
   intermediate with spermidine. The discovery of squalamine in the shark
   implicates a steroid as a potential host-defense agent in vertebrates and
   provides insights into the chemical design of a family of broad-spectrum
   antibiotics.

AB Lemon sharks immunized with bovine serum albumin produced two molecular
   forms of antibodies detectable by passive hemagglutination of
   antigen-coated, tanned sheep erythrocytes. Throughout the course of
   immunization 2-ME-sensitive antibody was associated with a 19S
   immunoglobulin fraction (4–5 mg/ml serum) while late in the course of
   immunization antibody was found also associated with a 7S immunoglobulin
   fraction (7–8 mg/ml serum). No evidence for any anamnestic response was
   found in these animals. Naturally occurring hemagglutinins for sheep
   erythrocytes were found to be 2-ME-sensitive and present in the 19S
   immunoglobulin fraction. These immunoglobulin fractions were readily
   purified by DEAE-cellulose chromatography and Sephadex G-200 gel
   filtration. Both immunoglobulin molecules yielded equimolar amounts of H
   and L polypeptide chains when subjected to extensive reduction and
   alkylation followed by gel filtration in 5 M guanidine-HCl. Antigenically
   reactive H and L chains were obtained by partial reduction and alkylation
   followed by gel filtration in 1 M propionic acid. The 7S and 19S
   immunoglobulin H chains were indistinguishable by fingerprints of tryptic
   digests, disc electrophoretic patterns, antigenic properties, and mass
   (molecular weight ∼70,000), thus suggesting these two molecules to belong
   to the same immunoglobulin class. The shark 19S and 7S immunoglobulin L
   chains were indistinguishable from each other by similar criteria and
   were different from the H chains. These L chains exhibited the
   electrophoretic heterogeneity of their mammalian counterparts. The 7S
   (shark immunoglobulin) molecule was shown to have a molecular weight of
   ∼160,000 and to consist of 2H and 2L polypeptide chains (total mass
   ≅180,000). The 19S molecule was shown to have a molecular weight of
   800,000–900,000; therefore, there were probably five 7S subunits per 19S
   molecule, comparable to mammalian γM. Other reasons for considering the
   7S and the 19S lemon shark molecules to belong to a class of
   immunoglobulins comparable to the γM class of mammals are that they both
   have high carbohydrate contents, and H chains of mass similar to µ
   chains. The lemon shark serum proteins with electrophoretic mobilities
   comparable to gamma G of mammals were not related to the immunoglobulins
   of this species. These proteins had no antibody activity and had no
   antigenic or chemical similarity to either the H chains, the L chains, or
   the intact immunoglobulin molecules from the lemon shark.

AB Shark is a new data analysis system that marries query processing with

   memory abstraction to provide a unified engine that can run SQL queries
   and sophisticated analytics functions (e.g. iterative machine learning)
   at scale, and efficiently recovers from failures mid-query. This allows
   Shark to run SQL queries up to 100X faster than Apache Hive, and machine
   learning programs more than 100X faster than Hadoop. Unlike previous
   systems, Shark shows that it is possible to achieve these speedups while
   retaining a MapReduce-like execution engine, and the fine-grained fault
   tolerance properties that such engine provides. It extends such an engine
   in several ways, including column-oriented in-memory storage and dynamic
   mid-query replanning, to effectively execute SQL. The result is a system
   that matches the speedups reported for MPP analytic databases over
   MapReduce, while offering fault tolerance properties and complex
   analytics capabilities that they lack.

AB The emergence of jawed vertebrates (gnathostomes) from jawless
   vertebrates was accompanied by major morphological and physiological
   innovations, such as hinged jaws, paired fins and immunoglobulin-based
   adaptive immunity. Gnathostomes subsequently diverged into two groups,
   the cartilaginous fishes and the bony vertebrates. Here we report the
   whole-genome analysis of a cartilaginous fish, the elephant shark
   (Callorhinchus milii). We find that the C. milii genome is the slowest
   evolving of all known vertebrates, including the ‘living fossil’
   coelacanth, and features extensive synteny conservation with tetrapod
   genomes, making it a good model for comparative analyses of gnathostome
   genomes. Our functional studies suggest that the lack of genes encoding
   secreted calcium-binding phosphoproteins in cartilaginous fishes explains
   the absence of bone in their endoskeleton. Furthermore, the adaptive
   immune system of cartilaginous fishes is unusual: it lacks the canonical
   CD4 co-receptor and most transcription factors, cytokines and cytokine
   receptors related to the CD4 lineage, despite the presence of polymorphic
   major histocompatibility complex class II molecules. It thus presents a
   new model for understanding the origin of adaptive immunity. Whole-genome
   analysis of the elephant shark, a cartilaginous fish, shows that it is
   the slowest evolving of all known vertebrates, lacks critical bone
   formation genes and has an unusual adaptive immune system. The elephant
   shark (Callorhinchus milii) is a cartilaginous fish native to the
   temperate waters off southern Australia and New Zealand, living at depths
   of 200 to 500 metres and migrating into shallow waters during spring for
   breeding. The genome sequence is published in this issue of Nature.
   Comparison with other vertebrate genomes shows that it is the slowest
   evolving genome of all known vertebrates — coelacanth included. Genome
   analysis points to an unusual adaptive immune system lacking the CD4
   receptor and some associated cytokines, indicating that cartilaginous
   fishes possess a primordial gnathostome adaptive immune system. Also
   absent are genes encoding secreted calcium-binding phosphoproteins, in
   line with the absence of bone in cartilaginous fish.

AB Sharks and other chondrichthyans are often described as long lived, slow
   growing and producing few offspring. These biological characteristics,
   together with the common assumption that recruitment is directly related
   to stock, and pessimistic stock prognoses obtained from application of
   demographic analysis, have led to doubts that sharks can be harvested
   sustainably. Developed over the past 40 or so years from studies of only
   a few shark species, these doubts have been reinforced by declining catch
   rates in industrial, artisanal and recreational fisheries and in fishing
   programmes designed to reduce the risk of sharks attacking humans at
   bathing beaches. However, more recent studies and application of
   modelling techniques allowing for density-dependent responses to the
   effects of stock reduction indicate that shark stocks can be harvested
   sustainably and, if carefully managed, can provide very stable fisheries.
   It is now understood that some species (such as Galeorhinus galeus,
   Carcharhinus plumbeus, Carcharodon carcharias and several species of
   dogfish) have low productivity, whereas other species (such as Mustelus
   antarcticus, Rhizoprionodon terraenovae, Sphyrna tiburo and Prionace
   glauca) have higher productivity. This paper reviews the use of shark
   products, the effects of fishing on shark populations of the world, and
   recent developments in assessment of shark fishery stocks.

AB The skin of fast sharks exhibits a rather intriguing three-dimensional
   rib pattern. Therefore, the question arises whether or not such
   three-dimensional riblet surfaces may produce an equivalent or even
   higher drag reduction than straight two-dimensional riblets. Previously,
   the latter have been shown to reduce turbulent wall shear stress by up to
   10%. Hence, the drag reduction by three-dimensional riblet surfaces is
   investigated experimentally. Our idealized 3D-surface consists of
   sharp-edged fin-shaped elements arranged in an interlocking array. The
   turbulent wall shear stress on this surface is measured using direct
   force balances. In a first attempt, wind tunnel experiments with about
   365,000 tiny fin elements per test surface have been carried out. Due to
   the complexity of the surface manufacturing process, a comprehensive
   parametric study was not possible. These initial wind tunnel data,
   however, hinted at an appreciable drag reduction. Subsequently, in order
   to have a better judgement on the potential of these 3D-surfaces, oil
   channel experiments are carried out. In our new oil channel, the
   geometrical dimensions of the fins can be magnified 10 times in size as
   compared to the initial wind tunnel experiments, i.e., from typically 0.5
   mm to 5 mm. For these latter oil channel experiments, novel test plates
   with variable fin configuration have been manufactured, with 1,920–4,000
   fins. This enhanced variability permits measurements with a comparatively
   large parameter range. As a result of our measurements, it can be
   concluded, that 3D-riblet surfaces do indeed produce an appreciable drag
   reduction. We found as much as 7.3% decreased turbulent shear stress, as
   compared to a smooth reference plate. However, in direct comparison with
   2D riblets, the performance of 3D-riblets is still inferior by about
   1.7%. On the other hand, it appears conceivable, with a careful design of
   the fin shape (possibly supported by theory), that this inferiority in
   performance might be reduced. Nevertheless, at present, it seems to be
   rather unlikely, that 3D-riblets can significantly outperform 2D-riblets.
   Finally, one interesting finding remains to be mentioned: The optimum
   drag reduction for short 3D-riblets occurs at a lower rib height than for
   longer 3D-riblets or for infinitely long 2D-riblets. The same observation
   had been made previously on shark scales of different species with
   differing rib lengths, but no explanation could be given.

AB Abstract: I explored the effect of uncertainty in demographic traits on
   demographic analyses of sharks, an approach not used before for this
   taxon. I used age-structured life tables and Leslie matrices based on a
   prebreeding survey and a yearly time step applied only to females to
   model the demography of 41 populations from 38 species of sharks
   representing four orders and nine families. I used Monte Carlo simulation
   to reflect uncertainty in the estimates of demographic traits and to
   calculate population statistics and elasticities for these populations; I
   used correlation analysis to identify the demographic traits that
   explained most of the variation in population growth rates ( λ ). The
   populations I examined fell along a continuum of life-history
   characteristics that can be linked to elasticity patterns. Sharks
   characterized by early age at maturity, short lifespan, and large litter
   size had high λ values and short generation times, whereas sharks that
   mature late and have long lifespans and small litters have low λ values
   and long generation times. Sharks at the “fast” end of the spectrum
   tended to have comparable adult and juvenile survival elasticities,
   whereas sharks at the “slow” end of the continuum had high juvenile
   survival elasticity and low age–zero survival ( or fertility )
   elasticity. Ratios of adult survival to fertility elasticities and
   juvenile survival to fertility elasticities suggest that many of the
   populations studied do not possess the biological attributes necessary to
   restore λ to its original level after moderate levels of exploitation.
   Elasticity analysis suggests that changes in juvenile survival would have
   the greatest effect on λ, and correlation analysis indicates that
   variation in juvenile survival, age at maturity, and reproduction account
   for most of the variation in λ. In general, combined results from
   elasticity and correlation analyses suggest that research, conservation,
   and management efforts should focus on these demographic traits.

AB OSCILLATING membrane potentials that generate rhythmic impulse patterns
   are considered to be of particular significance for neuronal information
   processing1–4. In contrast, noise is usually seen as a disturbance which
   limits the accuracy of information transfer5–8. We show here, however,
   that noise in combination with intrinsic oscillations can provide neurons
   with particular encoding properties, a discovery we made when recording
   from single electrosensory afferent of a fish. The temporal sequence of
   the impulse trains indicates oscillations that operate near the
   spike-triggering threshold. The oscillation frequency determines the
   basic rhythm of impulse generation, but whether or not an impulse is
   actually triggered essentially depends on superimposed noise. The
   probability of impulse generation can be altered considerably by minor
   modifications of oscillation baseline and amplitude, which may underlie
   the exquisite sensitivity of these receptors to thermal and electrical
   stimuli. Additionally, thermal, but not electrical, stimuli alter the
   oscillation frequency, allowing dual sensory messages to be conveyed in a
   single spike train. These findings demonstrate novel properties of
   sensory transduction which may be relevant for neuronal signalling in
   general.

   deliver their young or deposit their eggs, and where their young spend
   their first weeks, months, or years. These areas are usually located in
   shallow, energy rich coastal areas where the young find abundant food and
   have little predation by larger sharks. Nurseries are characterized by
   the presence of both gravid females and free swimming neonates. Neonates
   are young bearing fresh, unhealed umbilical scars in the case of
   placental species, or those at or near the birth size in aplacental
   species. Bulls Bay, South Carolina, is a nursery for the blacknose,
   spinner, finetooth, blacktip, sandbar, dusky, Atlantic sharpnose,
   scalloped hammerhead, and smooth dogfish sharks. The lemon shark has its

AB Summary Marine ecosystems are suffering severe depletion of apex
   predators worldwide [1–4]; shark declines are principally due to
   conservative life-histories and fisheries overexploitation [5–8]. On
   coral reefs, sharks are strongly interacting apex predators and play a
   key role in maintaining healthy reef ecosystems [9–11]. Despite
   increasing fishing pressure, reef shark catches are rarely subject to
   specific limits, with management approaches typically depending upon
   no-take marine reserves to maintain populations [12–14]. Here, we reveal
   that this approach is failing by documenting an ongoing collapse in two
   of the most abundant reef shark species on the Great Barrier Reef
   (Australia). We find an order of magnitude fewer sharks on fished reefs
   compared to no-entry management zones that encompass only 1% of reefs.
   No-take zones, which are more difficult to enforce than no-entry zones,
   offer almost no protection for shark populations. Population viability
   models of whitetip and gray reef sharks project ongoing steep declines in
   abundance of 7% and 17% per annum, respectively. These findings indicate
   that current management of no-take areas is inadequate for protecting
   reef sharks, even in one of the world's most-well-managed reef
   ecosystems. Further steps are urgently required for protecting this
   critical functional group from ecological extinction.

AB Stomach content data from 281 tiger sharks caught during shark control
   programs in Hawaii between 1967 and 1969, and during 1976 were analyzed
   to examine feeding habits and ontogenetic shifts in diet. As sharks
   increased in size, prey diversity and frequency of occurrence of large
   prey items increased. The percent occurrence of teleosts and cephalopods
   in stomachs decreased as sharks increased in length, while occurrence of
   elasmobranchs, turtles, land mammals, crustaceans, and undigestible items
   increased. Comparisons between the diets of tiger sharks from Hawaii and
   other locations indicate that ontogenetic shifts are universal in this
   species and that tiger sharks may be opportunistic feeders that prey
   heavily on abundant, easy to capture prey. Small tiger sharks may be
   spatially segregated from medium and large sharks and appear to be
   primarily nocturnal, bottom feeders. Large tiger sharks feed near the
   bottom at night, but also feed at the surface during the day. Prey,
   similar in size to humans, begin to occur in the diet of tiger sharks
   approximately 230 cm TL, and therefore sharks of this size and larger may
   pose the greatest threat to humans. Ontogenetic shifts in diet may be
   attributed to increased size of sharks, expanded range and exploitation
   of habitats of larger sharks, and/or improved hunting skill of larger
   sharks.

   influence of various factors on fishery performance, defined as nominal
   catch- per-unit-effort (CPUE) of swordfish (Xiphias gladius) and blue
   shark (Prionace glauca) in the Hawaii-based swordfish fishery. Commercial
   fisheries data for the analysis consisted of a 5 year (1991–1995) time
   series of 27 901 longline sets. Mesoscale relationships were analysed for
   seven physical variables (latitude, longitude, SST, SST frontal energy,
   temporal changes in SST (ΔSST), SST frontal energy (ΔSST frontal energy)
   and bathymetry), all of which may affect the availability of swordfish
   and blue shark to the fishery, and three variables (number of lightsticks
   per hook, lunar index, and wind velocity) which may relate to the
   effectiveness of the fishing gear. Longline CPUE data were analysed in
   relation to SST data on three spatiotemporal scales (18 km weekly,
   1°-weekly, 1°-monthly). Depending on the scale of SST data, GAM analysis
   accounted for 39–42% and 44–45% of the variance in nominal CPUE for
   swordfish and blue shark, respectively. Stepwise GAM building revealed
   the relative importance of the variables in explaining the variance in
   CPUE. For swordfish, by decreasing importance, the variables ranked: (1)
   latitude, (2) time, (3) longitude, (4) lunar index, (5) lightsticks per
   hook, (6) SST, (7) ΔSST frontal energy, (8) wind velocity, (9) SST
   frontal energy, (10) bathymetry, and (11) ΔSST. For blue shark, the
   variables ranked: (1) latitude, (2) longitude, (3) time, (4) SST, (5)
   lightsticks per hook, (6) ΔSST, (7) ΔSST frontal energy, (8) SST frontal
   energy, (9) wind velocity, (10) lunar index, and (11) bathymetry.
   Swordfish CPUE increased with latitude to peak at 35–40°N and increased
   in the vicinity of temperature fronts and during the full moon. Shark
   CPUE also increased with latitude up to 40°N, and increased westward, but
   declined abruptly at SSTs colder than 16°C. As a comparison with
   modelling fishery performance in relation to specific environmental and
   fishery operational effects, fishery performance was also modelled as a
   function of categorical time (month) and area (2° squares) variables
   using a generalized linear model (GLM) approach. The variance accounted
   for by the GLMs was ≈ 1–3% lower than the variance explained by the GAMs.
   Time series of swordfish and blue shark CPUE standardized for the
   environmental and operational variables quantified in the GAM and for the
   time-area effects in the GLM are presented. For swordfish, both nominal
   and standardized time series indicate a decline in CPUE, whereas the
   opposite trend was seen for blue shark.

AB Owing to their phylogenetic position, cartilaginous fishes (sharks, rays,
   skates, and chimaeras) provide a critical reference for our understanding
   of vertebrate genome evolution. The relatively small genome of the
   elephant shark, Callorhinchus milii, a chimaera, makes it an attractive
   model cartilaginous fish genome for whole-genome sequencing and
   comparative analysis. Here, the authors describe survey sequencing (1.4×
   coverage) and comparative analysis of the elephant shark genome, one of
   the first cartilaginous fish genomes to be sequenced to this depth.
   Repetitive sequences, represented mainly by a novel family of short
   interspersed element–like and long interspersed element–like sequences,
   account for about 28% of the elephant shark genome. Fragments of
   approximately 15,000 elephant shark genes reveal specific examples of
   genes that have been lost differentially during the evolution of tetrapod
   and teleost fish lineages. Interestingly, the degree of conserved synteny
   and conserved sequences between the human and elephant shark genomes are
   higher than that between human and teleost fish genomes. Elephant shark
   contains putative four Hox clusters indicating that, unlike teleost fish
   genomes, the elephant shark genome has not experienced an additional
   whole-genome duplication. These findings underscore the importance of the
   elephant shark as a critical reference vertebrate genome for comparative
   analysis of the human and other vertebrate genomes. This study also
   demonstrates that a survey-sequencing approach can be applied
   productively for comparative analysis of distantly related vertebrate
   genomes.

AB Elasmobranch reproductive behavior has been inferred from freshly caught
   specimens, laboratory examinations of reproductive structures and
   function, or determined from direct observations of captive or free
   swimming wild animals. Several general behaviors have been described
   including seasonal sexual segregation, courtship and copulation.
   Courtship behavior was inferred for many species from the presence of
   scars and tooth cuts on the female's body, and noted in more detail from
   underwater observations. Copulation has been directly observed in captive
   settings for several species of elasmobranchs in large aquaria, and in
   the wild for three species of urolophids and for Triaenodon obesus and
   Ginglymostoma cirratum. A detailed ‘case history’ of nurse shark
   reproductive behavior is presented that may be used as a template for
   future work on shark reproductive behavior of other species. Our studies,
   using diver identifiable tags and in situ behavioral observations,
   provide unprecedented information on social structure and mating behavior
   in this species. Since 1993, 115 G. cirratum, 45 adults and 70 juveniles
   have been tagged in the Dry Tortugas, Florida. Observations show that
   adult males visit the study site every year with three males dominant.
   Individual adult females visit the study area to mate in alternate years.
   Polygyny and polyandry are common. Future research on reproductive
   behavior of elasmobranchs should address questions on male access to
   females, sexual selection and dominance hierarchies.

AB Female scalloped hammerhead sharks move offshore at a smaller size than
   do males to form schools composed primarily of intermediate size female
   sharks. This movement results in smaller females feeding more on pelagic
   prey than do males and with greater predatory success. It is contended
   that this change in habitat causes females to grow more rapidly to
   reproductive size. Intermediate size females grow at a more rapid rate
   than males. Female scalloped hammerhead sharks mature at a size larger
   than males. For many elasmobranch species, females: (1) occupy a
   different habitat, (2) grow more rapidly prior to maturity and continue
   growth following maturation, (3) feed on different prey with increased
   feeding success, and (4) reproduce at a size larger than males. It is
   suggested that female segregation increases fitness, resulting in more
   rapid growth for the former sex. The females reach maturity at the larger
   size necessary to support embryonic young, yet similar age to males,
   matching the female reproductive lifetime to that of males.

AB 1. A predictive framework of community and ecosystem dynamics that
   applies across systems has remained elusive, in part because
   non-consumptive predator effects are often ignored. Further, it is
   unclear how much individual-level detail community models must include.
   2. Previous studies of short-lived species suggest that state-dependent
   decisions add little to our understanding of community dynamics. Body
   condition-dependent decisions made by long-lived herbivores under risk of
   predation, however, might have greater community-level effects. This
   possibility remains largely unexplored, especially in marine
   environments. 3. In the relatively pristine seagrass community of Shark
   Bay, Australia, we found that herbivorous green sea turtles (Chelonia
   mydas Linnaeus, 1758) threatened by tiger sharks (Galeocerdo cuvier Peron
   and LeSueur, 1822) select microhabitats in a condition-dependent manner.
   Turtles in poor body condition selected profitable, high-risk
   microhabitats, while turtles in good body condition, which are more
   abundant, selected safer, less profitable microhabitats. When predation
   risk was low, however, turtles in good condition moved into more
   profitable microhabitats. 4. Condition-dependent use of space by turtles
   shows that tiger sharks modify the spatio-temporal pattern of turtle
   grazing and their impacts on ecosystem dynamics (a trait-mediated
   indirect interaction). Therefore, state-dependent decisions by
   individuals can have important implications for community dynamics in
   some situations. 5. Our study suggests that declines in large-bodied
   sharks may affect ecosystems more substantially than assumed when
   non-lethal effects of these top predators on mesoconsumers are not
   considered explicitly.

   thus a whole-body exotendon whose mechanical advantage in transmitting
   muscular contraction is greater than that of the endoskeleton.

AB The tagging of sharks using conventional tags has long been recognized as
   a valuable means for studying various aspects of their life history,
   migrations and movements, and population structure. Conventional tags are
   defined as those that can be identified visually without the use of
   special detection equipment. Tagging studies specifically targeting
   sharks began in the late 1920's, and today numerous cooperative shark
   tagging programs exist worldwide. Cooperative programs depend on the
   joint participation of scientists and public volunteers to accomplish
   research objectives. Benefits and problems of these programs are
   discussed using the tagging methodologies, protocols, and results of the
   National Marine Fisheries Service Cooperative Shark Tagging Program. An
   additional 63 shark tagging studies and programs of all types are
   reviewed. Information useful for behavioral, biological, and fishery
   management studies can be derived from data resulting from these studies,
   including species and size composition, sex ratios, spatial and temporal
   distribution, migrations, movement patterns, rates of travel, delineation
   of pupping grounds, distribution of maturity intervals, indices of
   relative abundance, and recognition of individuals. Specific tagging
   experiments can be designed to provide additional data on age and growth,
   homing and site fidelity, dispersal rate, residence time, movement rates,
   tag shedding, and population parameters (e.g. size, mortality,
   recruitment, exploitation, interaction rates, and stock identity).
   Sources of bias inherent in tagging and recapture data include mortality,
   variation in tagging effort and fishing pressure, non-recovery and
   non-reporting of tags, and tag shedding. Recent advances in tagging
   methodologies that complement and extend conventional tagging studies
   will further our knowledge on shark movements and migrations,
   particularly in the areas of resource utilization and management, space
   utilization, and population dynamics.

AB Summary: The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genomic region is
   composed of a group of linked genes involved functionally with the
   adaptive and innate immune systems. The class I and class II genes are
   intrinsic features of the MHC and have been found in all the jawed
   vertebrates studied so far. The MHC genomic regions of the human and the
   chicken (B locus) have been fully sequenced and mapped, and the mouse MHC
   sequence is almost finished. Information on the MHC genomic structures
   (size, complexity, genic and intergenic composition and organization,
   gene order and number) of other vertebrates is largely limited or
   nonexistent. Therefore, we are mapping, sequencing and analyzing the MHC
   genomic regions of different human haplotypes and at least eight nonhuman
   species. Here, we review our progress with these sequences and compare
   the human MHC structure with that of the nonhuman primates (chimpanzee
   and rhesus macaque), other mammals (pigs, mice and rats) and nonmammalian
   vertebrates such as birds (chicken and quail), bony fish (medaka,
   pufferfish and zebrafish) and cartilaginous fish (nurse shark). This
   comparison reveals a complex MHC structure for mammals and a relatively
   simpler design for nonmammalian animals with a hypothetical prototypic
   structure for the shark. In the mammalian MHC, there are two to five
   different class I duplication blocks embedded within a framework of
   conserved nonclass I and/or nonclass II genes. With a few exceptions, the
   class I framework genes are absent from the MHC of birds, bony fish and
   sharks. Comparative genomics of the MHC reveal a highly plastic region
   with major structural differences between the mammalian and nonmammalian
   vertebrates. Additional genomic data are needed on animals of the
   reptilia, crocodilia and marsupial classes to find the origins of the
   class I framework genes and examples of structures that may be
   intermediate between the simple and complex MHC organizations of birds
   and mammals, respectively.

AB Abstract We determined the relationship between the activation state and
   phosphorylation state of the Na-K-Cl cotransport protein in tubules
   isolated from the shark rectal gland, a prototypic chloride-secreting
   epithelium. In response to cAMP-dependent secretagogues (e.g. vasoactive
   intestinal peptide, adenosine, and forskolin) or osmotically induced
   changes in cell volume, the activation state of the cotransport protein
   (assessed from measurements of loop diuretic binding) increased 5-10
   fold. The response was temporally associated with a comparable increase
   (3-9 fold) in cotransport protein phosphorylation. Graded changes in
   cotransporter activation evoked proportional changes in cotransporter
   phosphorylation. Under the conditions of our experiments, the 195-kDa
   cotransporter was the only membrane protein whose phosphorylation state
   increased conspicuously in response to both cAMP and cell shrinkage. Both
   stimuli promoted phosphorylation of the cotransport protein at serine and
   threonine residues. One of the cAMP-sensitive phosphoacceptors was found
   within a segment of the cotransport protein comprised of a sequence
   (Phe-Gly-His-Asn-Thr*-Ile-Asp-Ala-Val-Pro) that corresponds to a segment
   of the Na-K-Cl cotransport protein predicted by cDNA analysis, where the
   phosphoacceptor (Thr*) is threonine 189. Incubation of rectal gland
   tubules with K-252a or H-8, structurally different protein kinase
   inhibitors, rendered the cotransporter insensitive to both cAMP and cell
   shrinkage. We conclude that the rectal gland Na-K-Cl cotransport protein
   is regulated by direct reversible phosphorylation at serine and threonine
   sites.

AB Large marine fishes typically have little population genetic structure.
   The exceptions are associated with sedentary behaviour, disjunct
   distributions, or reproductive philopatry. Scalloped hammerhead sharks
   (Sphyrna lewini) incorporate the contrasting traits of oceanic habitat
   (usually associated with high dispersal) and possible fidelity to nursery
   grounds (for reproductive females). To evaluate the expectations of these
   contrasting behaviours, we examined the global genetic structure of S.
   lewini based on collections (n = 271 individuals) from 20 nursery areas.
   A 548-bp fragment of mitochondrial DNA control region revealed 22
   polymorphic sites, 24 haplotypes, and three lineages distinguished by
   2.56–3.77% sequence divergence. Coalescence analyses based on a
   provisional molecular clock indicate an origin in the Indo-West Pacific
   with late Pleistocene radiations into the central Pacific (Hawaii) and
   eastern Pacific (Central America), as well as recent interchange between
   oceans via southern Africa. Population subdivisions are strong (overall
   ΦST = 0.749, P 10). We conclude that nursery populations linked by
   continuous coastline have high connectivity, but that oceanic dispersal
   by females is rare. Although we cannot rule out philopatry to natal
   nurseries, oceanic barriers appear to have a much stronger influence on
   the genetic architecture of this species and may indicate a mechanism for
   recent evolutionary radiations in the genus Sphyrna.

   combine the shark skin (anisotropic flow leading to low drag) and lotus
   (superhydrophobic and self-cleaning) effects, producing what we call here
   the rice and butterfly wing effect. A systematic study has been conducted
   with rice leaves and butterfly wings, using a combination of actual and
   replica samples. In order to mimic the rice and butterfly wing effect,
   replica rice leaf and shark skin samples received a superhydrophobic and
   low adhesion nanostructured coating. The data are compared to those of
   uncoated samples of fish scales and shark skin. Surface morphology
   characterization is conducted with SEM and optical profiler imaging using
   software analysis. Drag is determined with pressure drop measurements
   from replica lined rectangular duct flow channels (using water and air in

   are discussed and conceptual models shown describing the role of surface

AB Students of democratic politics have long believed that voters punish

   However, this vision of a sophisticated retrospective electorate does not
   bear close examination. We find that voters regularly punish governments
   for acts of God, including droughts, floods, and shark attacks. As long
   as responsibility for the event itself (or more commonly, for its
   amelioration) can somehow be attributed to the government in a story
   persuasive within the folk culture, the electorate will take out its
   frustrations on the incumbents and vote for out-parties. Thus, voters in

   and the spatial structure of the trends in catch rate. The data on
   whether or not the catch rate is zero and the catch rate given that it is
   non-zero are analysed separately and then combined to provide indices of
   abundance. The former analysis is based on assuming the data are
   Bernoulli random variables. Given the uncertainty about the appropriate
   error-model to assume when fitting generalized linear models to catch and
   effort data, four alternative error-models — log-normal, log-gamma,
   Poisson, and negative binomial — were explored when modelling the

AB The burgeoning and largely unregulated trade in shark fins represents one
   of the most serious threats to shark populations worldwide. In Hong Kong,
   the world's largest shark fin market, fins are classified by traders into
   Chinese-name categories on the basis of market value, but the
   relationship between market category and shark species is unclear,
   preventing identification of species that are the most heavily traded. To
   delineate these relationships, we designed a sampling strategy for
   collecting statistically sufficient numbers of fins from traders and
   categories under conditions of limited market access because of
   heightened trader sensitivities. Based on information from traders and
   morphological inspection, we hypothesized matches between market names
   and shark taxa for fins within 11 common trade categories. These
   hypotheses were tested using DNA-based species identification techniques
   to determine the concordance between market category and species. Only 14
   species made up approximately 40% of the auctioned fin weight. The
   proportion of samples confirming the hypothesized match, or concordance,
   varied from 0.64 to 1 across the market categories. We incorporated the
   concordance information and available market auction records for these
   categories into stochastic models to estimate the contribution of each
   taxon by weight to the fin trade. Auctioned fin weight was dominated by
   the blue shark (Prionace glauca), which was 17% of the overall market.
   Other taxa, including the shortfin mako (Isurus oxyrinchus), silky
   (Carcharhinus falciformis), sandbar (C. obscurus), bull (C. leucas),
   hammerhead (Sphyrna spp.), and thresher (Alopias spp.), were at least
   2-6% of the trade. Our approach to marketplace monitoring of wildlife
   products is particularly applicable to situations in which quantitative
   data at the source of resource extraction are sparse and large-scale
   genetic testing is limited by budgetary or other market access
   constraints.

AB Global declines of shark populations are of concern because of their
   largely assumed role as moderators of ecosystem function. Without
   long-term data on movement patterns for many species, it is impossible to
   infer relative extinction risk, which varies as a function of range,
   dispersal and habitat specificity and use. The past 50 yr of research on
   coastal sharks has revealed common movement patterns among species. In
   the horizontal plane, measured home range size generally increases with
   body size. We demonstrate meta-analytically the effects of increasing
   body size and monitoring time on home range size. Changes in the extent
   of horizontal movement might arise from ontogeny, predator avoidance or
   environmental tolerances. In the vertical plane, movement patterns
   include oscillatory vertical displacement, surface swimming, diel
   vertical migration and swimming at depth. These vertical movements are
   often attributed to foraging or navigation, but have been quan- tified
   less than horizontal patterns. Habitat specificity is often correlated
   with environmental condi- tions such as depth, salinity, substratum, and
   in some cases, prey availability. Site fidelity is common in species that
   use nursery areas. However, fidelity to mating, pupping, feeding and
   natal sites has only been observed in a few species. To date, few studies
   have examined habitat partitioning, although some general patterns have
   emerged: habitats appear to be subdivided by benthos type, prey
   availability and depth. The conservation of coastal sharks can be
   facilitated in some cases by the use of marine protected areas,
   especially for coastal resident species using specific nursery, repro-
   duction or feeding areas. Partial protected-area closures might be
   effective during aggregation or migration periods to protect older size
   classes, but these must be applied with other management strategies such
   as reduced fishing and size or bag limits to protect individuals
   throughout different life history phases. More long-term research on
   habitat use, migration patterns and habitat partition- ing is essential
   for developing successful management initiatives for coastal shark
   populations.

AB Especially in aquatic habitats, hypoxia can be an important evolutionary
   driving force resulting in both convergent and divergent physiological
   strategies for hypoxic survival. Examining adaptations to anoxic/hypoxic
   survival in hypoxia-tolerant animals may offer fresh ideas for the
   treatment of hypoxia-related diseases. Here, we summarise our present
   knowledge of two fishes that have evolved to survive hypoxia under very
   different circumstances. The crucian carp ( Carassius carassius ) is of
   particular interest because of its extreme anoxia tolerance. During the
   long North European winter, it survives for months in completely
   oxygen-deprived freshwater habitats. The crucian carp also tolerates a
   few days of anoxia at room temperature and, unlike anoxia-tolerant
   freshwater turtles, it is still physically active in anoxia. Moreover,
   the crucian carp does not appear to reduce neuronal ion permeability
   during anoxia and may primarily rely on more subtle neuromodulatory
   mechanisms for anoxic metabolic depression. The epaulette shark (
   Hemiscyllium ocellatum ) is a tropical marine vertebrate. It lives on
   shallow reef platforms that repeatedly become cut off from the ocean
   during periods of low tides. During nocturnal low tides, the water [O2]
   can fall by 80% due to respiration of the coral and associated organisms.
   Since the tides become lower and lower over a period of a few days, the
   hypoxic exposure during subsequent low tides will become progressively
   longer and more severe. Thus, this shark is under a natural hypoxic
   preconditioning regimen. Interestingly, hypoxic preconditioning lowers
   its metabolic rate and its critical P O2. Moreover, repeated anoxia
   appears to stimulate metabolic depression in an adenosine-dependent way.

AB Although the functional properties of shark skin have been of
   considerable interest to both biologists and engineers because of the
   complex hydrodynamic effects of surface roughness, no study to date has
   successfully fabricated a flexible biomimetic shark skin that allows
   detailed study of hydrodynamic function. We present the first study of
   the design, fabrication and hydrodynamic testing of a synthetic,
   flexible, shark skin membrane. A three-dimensional (3D) model of shark
   skin denticles was constructed using micro-CT imaging of the skin of the
   shortfin mako ( Isurus oxyrinchus ). Using 3D printing, thousands of
   rigid synthetic shark denticles were placed on flexible membranes in a
   controlled, linear-arrayed pattern. This flexible 3D printed shark skin
   model was then tested in water using a robotic flapping device that
   allowed us to either hold the models in a stationary position or move
   them dynamically at their self-propelled swimming speed. Compared with a
   smooth control model without denticles, the 3D printed shark skin showed
   increased swimming speed with reduced energy consumption under certain
   motion programs. For example, at a heave frequency of 1.5 Hz and an
   amplitude of ±1 cm, swimming speed increased by 6.6% and the energy
   cost-of-transport was reduced by 5.9%. In addition, a leading-edge vortex
   with greater vorticity than the smooth control was generated by the 3D
   printed shark skin, which may explain the increased swimming speeds. The
   ability to fabricate synthetic biomimetic shark skin opens up a wide
   array of possible manipulations of surface roughness parameters, and the
   ability to examine the hydrodynamic consequences of diverse skin denticle
   shapes present in different shark species.

AB We recently have identified an antigen receptor in sharks called NAR (new
   or nurse shark antigen receptor) that is secreted by splenocytes but does
   not associate with Ig light (L) chains. The NAR variable (V) region
   undergoes high levels of somatic mutation and is equally divergent from
   both Ig and T cell receptors (TCR). Here we show by electron microscopy
   that NAR V regions, unlike those of conventional Ig and TCR, do not form
   dimers but rather are independent, flexible domains. This unusual feature
   is analogous to bona fide camelid IgG in which modifications of Ig heavy
   chain V (VH) sequences prevent dimer formation with L chains. NAR also
   displays a uniquely flexible constant (C) region. Sequence analysis and
   modeling show that there are only two types of expressed NAR genes, each
   having different combinations of noncanonical cysteine (Cys) residues in
   the V domains that likely form disulfide bonds to stabilize the single
   antigen-recognition unit. In one NAR class, rearrangement events result
   in mature genes encoding an even number of Cys (two or four) in
   complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3), which is analogous to Cys
   codon expression in an unusual human diversity (D) segment family. The
   NAR CDR3 Cys generally are encoded by preferred reading frames of
   rearranging D segments, providing a clear design for use of preferred
   reading frame in antigen receptor D regions. These unusual
   characteristics shared by NAR and unconventional mammalian Ig are most
   likely the result of convergent evolution at the molecular level.

   within a coastal nursery area to define how individuals use the nursery
   habitat throughout the summer. We used a series of acoustic hydrophones
   to passively monitor the movement patterns of sharks for periods up to
   167 days. We used passive monitoring data to calculate home range
   estimates using minimum convex polygon (MCP) and fixed kernel estimators.
   MCP calculated the extent of an individual's range. Kernel estimates
   provided information regarding the utilization of space within the home
   range including core area (50% kernel) and larger excursions outside the
   core area (95% kernel). Individuals within the nursery area typically
   used a consistently small core area. All sharks monitored in the study
   site underwent a home range expansion during the month of July,
   suggesting a synchronous population-level change in habitat use. This
   change in habitat use was reflected in all home range calculations.
   Passive monitoring revealed that young sharks remain within the nursery
   area for up to 6 months. The long-term use of this nursery area reflects
   its critical importance to young blacktip sharks.

AB Substantial ecological, economic and social problems result from shark
   interactions in pelagic longline fisheries. Improved understanding of
   industry attitudes and practices towards shark interactions assists with
   managing these problems. Information on fisher knowledge and new
   strategies for shark avoidance may benefit sharks and fishers. A study of
   12 pelagic longline fisheries from eight countries shows that incentives
   to avoid sharks vary along a continuum, based on whether sharks represent
   an economic disadvantage or advantage. Shark avoidance practices are
   limited, including avoiding certain areas, moving when shark interaction
   rates are high, using fish instead of squid for bait and deeper setting.
   Some conventionally employed fishing gear and methods used to target
   non-shark species contribute to shark avoidance. Shark repellents hold
   promise; more research and development is needed. Development of
   specifically designed equipment to discard sharks could improve shark
   post release survival prospects, reduce gear loss and improve crew
   safety. With expanding exploitation of sharks for fins and meat, improved
   data collection, monitoring and precautionary shark management measures
   are needed to ensure that shark fishing mortality levels are sustainable.

AB The basal area and productivity of managrove wetlands are described in
   relation to selected soil properties to understand the general pattern of
   optimum forest stature at the mouth of estuaries in the Everglades, such
   as the Shark River Slough, Florida (U.S.). The basal area of mangroves
   decreases from 40.4 m2 ha−1 and 39.7 m2 ha−1 at two stations 1.8 km and
   4.1 km from the estuary mouth to 20.7 m2 ha−1 and 19.6 m2 ha−1 at two
   sites 9.9 km and 18.2 km from the mouth, respectively. The gradient in
   basal area at these four sites is mostly the result of approximately 34
   yr of growth since Hurricane Donna. Wood productivity is higher in the
   lower estuary (10.7 Mg ha−1 yr−1 and 12.0 Mg ha−1 yr−1) than in the upper
   estuary (3.2 Mg ha−1 yr−1 and 4.2 Mg ha−1 yr−1). Porewater salinity among
   these four mangrove sites during seasonal sampling in 1994 and 1995
   ranged from 1.6 g kg−1 to 33.5 g kg−1, while sulfide was generally<0.15
   mM at all sites. These soil values indicate that abiotic stress cannot
   explain the decrease in forest structure along this estuarine gradient.
   Concentrations of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) are more closely
   related to patterns of forest development, with higher soil fertility at
   the mouth of the estuary as indicated by higher concentrations of
   extractable ammonium, total soil P, and available P, along with higher
   ammonium production rates. The more fertile sites of the lower estuary
   are dominated by Laguncularia racemosa, whereas the less fertile sites in
   the intermediate and upper estuary are dominated by Rhizophora mangle.
   Relative N mineralization per unit of total N is higher in the lower
   estuary and is related positively to concentrations of available P,
   indicating the importance of turnover rates and nutrient interactions to
   soil fertility. Concentrations of Ca-bound P per volume soil in the lower
   estuary is 40-fold higher than in the upper estuary, and along with an
   increase in residual P in the upper estuary, indicate a shift from
   mineral to organic P along the estuarine gradient. Mineral inputs to the
   mouth of Shark River estuary from the Gulf of Mexico (rather than upland
   inputs) apparently control the patterns of mangrove structure and
   productivity.

AB Abstract Arguments for conservation of sharks based on their role in the
   maintenance of healthy marine ecosystems have failed to halt the
   worldwide decline in populations. Instead, the value of sharks as a
   fishery commodity has severely reduced the abundance of these animals.
   Conservation may be assisted by the development of an alternative
   approach that emphasizes the economic value of sharks as a non-harvested
   resource. Our study quantifies the value of a tourism industry based on
   shark diving. Using data collected from surveys, as well as government
   statistics, we show that shark diving is a major contributor to the
   economy of Palau, generating US$18 million per year and accounting for
   approximately 8% of the gross domestic product of the country. Annually,
   shark diving was responsible for the disbursement of US$1.2 million in
   salaries to the local community, and generated US$1.5 million in taxes to
   the government. If the population of approximately 100 sharks that
   interact with tourists at popular dive sites was harvested by fishers,
   their economic value would be at most US$10 800, a fraction of the worth
   of these animals as a non-consumptive resource. Fishers earn more selling
   fish for consumption by shark divers than they would gain by catching
   sharks. Shark diving provides an attractive economic alternative to shark
   fishing, with distribution of revenues benefiting several sectors of the
   economy, stimulating the development and generating high revenues to the
   government, while ensuring the ecological sustainability of shark
   populations.

   species, and specimens which are poorly preserved or have had key
   diagnostic features removed, can be difficult to identify. This study
   examined DNA barcoding as a method to identify shark species from dried
   fins, confiscated from a vessel fishing illegally in Australian waters.
   211 left pectoral fins were examined. 18 either did not provide a
   sequenceable product or yielded a microbial sequence, while 193 fins
   (91.5%) provided a chondrichthyan sequence. All of these could be matched
   to reference specimens in a DNA barcode database, and so were able to be
   identified. 27 species were detected, 20 species of sharks and seven
   species of rays The most abundant species (22% of fins) was Carcharhinus
   dussumieri. Many of these species are listed on the World Conservation
   Union (IUCN) Red List and include one, Anoyxpristis cuspidata (3%), rated
   as critically endangered. Fishing authorities can use DNA barcoding to
   gather data on which chondrichthyan species are targeted by illegal
   fishers, information that will greatly assist in management and

   the generalized information criterion, the ZINB regression model provided
   a better fit to the data than either Poisson, negative binomial or
   zero-inflated Poisson regression models. To demonstrate the utility of
   the ZINB regression model for the standardization of catch data,
   standardized temporal trends in bycatch rates estimated with the ZINB
   regression model are computed and compared to those obtained from fits of
   the other three types of models to the same data. With the exception of
   the negative binomial, estimated temporal trends were more similar among

AB Network file systems offer a powerful, transparent interface for
   accessing remote data. Unfortunately, in current network file systems
   like NFS, clients fetch data from a central file server, inherently
   limiting the system's ability to scale to many clients. While recent
   distributed (peer-to-peer) systems have managed to eliminate this
   scalability bottleneck, they are often exceedingly complex and provide
   non-standard models for administration and accountability. We present
   Shark, a novel system that retains the best of both worlds--the
   scalability of distributed systems with the simplicity of central
   servers. Shark is a distributed file system designed for large-scale,
   wide-area deployment, while also providing a drop-in replacement for
   local-area file systems. Shark introduces a novel cooperative-caching
   mechanism, in which mutually-distrustful clients can exploit each others'
   file caches to reduce load on an origin file server. Using a distributed
   index, Shark clients find nearby copies of data, even when files
   originate from different servers. Performance results show that Shark can
   greatly reduce server load and improve client latency for read-heavy
   workloads both in the wide and local areas, while still remaining
   competitive for single clients in the local area. Thus, Shark enables
   modestly-provisioned file servers to scale to hundreds of read-mostly
   clients while retaining traditional usability, consistency, security, and
   accountability.

AB Summary 1 The ability to identify individual animals is a critical aid in
   wildlife and conservation studies requiring information on behaviour,
   distribution, habitat use, population and life-history parameters. We
   present a computer-aided photo-identification technique that relies on
   natural marks to identify individuals of Carcharias taurus, a shark
   species that is critically endangered off the eastern Australian coast
   and considered globally vulnerable. The technique could potentially be
   applied to a range of species of similar form and bearing natural marks.
   2 The use of natural marks for photo-identification is a non-invasive
   technique for identifying individual animals. As photo-identification
   databases grow larger, and their implementation spans several years, the
   historically used visual-matching processes lose accuracy and speed. A
   computerized pattern-matching system that requires initial user
   interaction to select the key features aids researchers by considerably
   reducing the time needed for identification of individuals. 3 Our method
   uses a two-dimensional affine transformation to compare two individuals
   in a commonly defined reference space. The methodology was developed
   using a database of 221 individually identifiable sharks that were
   photographically marked and rephotographed over 9 years, demonstrating
   both the efficacy of the technique and that the natural pigment marks of
   C. taurus are a reliable means of tracking individuals over several
   years. 4 Synthesis and applications. The identification of individual
   animals that are naturally marked with spots or similar patterns is
   achieved with an interactive pattern-matching system that uses an affine
   transformation to compare selected points in a single-user computer-aided
   interface. Our technique has been used successfully on C. taurus and we
   believe the methodology can be applied to other species of a similar form
   that have natural marks or patterns. The identification of individuals
   allows accurate tracking of their movements and distribution, and
   contributes to better population estimates for improved wildlife
   management and conservation planning.

AB Summary 1. Diel vertical migration (DVM) is a widespread phenomenon among
   marine and freshwater organisms and many studies with various taxa have
   sought to understand its adaptive significance. Among crustacean
   zooplankton and juveniles of some fish species DVM is accepted widely as
   an antipredator behaviour, but little is known about its adaptive value
   for relatively large-bodied, adult predatory fish such as sharks.
   Moreover, the majority of studies have focused on pelagic forms, which
   raises the question of whether DVM occurs in bottom-living predators. 2.
   To investigate DVM in benthic predatory fish in the marine environment
   and to determine why it might occur we tracked movements of adult male
   dogfish ( Scyliorhinus canicula ) by short- and long-term acoustic and
   archival telemetry. Movement studies were complemented with measurements
   of prey abundance and availability and thermal habitat within home
   ranges. A thermal choice experiment and energy budget modelling was used
   to investigate trade-offs between foraging and thermal habitat selection.
   3. Male dogfish undertook normal DVM (nocturnal ascent) within relatively
   small home ranges ( ∼ 100 × 100 m) comprising along-bottom movements up
   submarine slopes from deeper, colder waters occupied during the day into
   warmer, shallow prey-rich areas above the thermocline at night. Few
   daytime vertical movements occurred. Levels of activity were higher
   during the night above the thermocline compared to below it during the
   day indicating they foraged in warm water and rested in colder depths. 4.
   A thermal choice experiment using environmentally realistic temperatures
   supported the field observation that dogfish positively avoided warmer
   water even when it was associated with greater food availability. Males
   in laboratory aquaria moved into warm water from a cooler refuge only to
   obtain food, and after food consumption they preferred to rest and digest
   in cooler water. 5. Modelling of energy budgets under different realistic
   thermal-choice scenarios indicated dogfish adopting a ‘hunt warm − rest
   cool’ strategy could lower daily energy costs by just over 4%. Our
   results provide the first clear evidence that are consistent with the
   hypothesis that a benthic marine-fish predator utilizes DVM as an energy
   conservation strategy that increases bioenergetic efficiency.

AB Tiger sharks, Galeocerdo cuvier, are apex predators in a variety of
   nearshore ecosystems throughout the world. This study investigates the
   biology of tiger sharks in the shallow seagrass ecosystem of Shark Bay,
   Western Australia. Tiger sharks (n = 252) were the most commonly caught
   species (94%) compared to other large sharks. Tiger sharks ranged from
   148–407 cm TL. The overall sex ratio was biased towards females (1.8 :
   1), but the sex ratio of mature animals (> 300 cm TL) did not differ from
   1 : 1. Contrary to previous accounts, tiger sharks were caught more often
   in all habitats during daylight hours than at night. Tiger shark catch
   rates were highly correlated with water temperature and were highest when
   water temperatures were above 19°C. The seasonal abundance of tiger
   sharks is correlated to both water temperature and the occurrence of
   their main prey: sea snakes and dugongs, Dugong dugon. Stomach contents
   analysis indicated that sea turtles and smaller elasmobranchs were also
   common prey. The importance of major seagrass grazers (dugongs and green
   sea turtles, Chelonia mydas) in the diet of tiger sharks suggests the
   possibility that these sharks are keystone predators in this ecosystem.

AB Stromatolites, organosedimentary structures formed by microbial activity,
   are found throughout the geological record and are important markers of
   biological history. More conspicuous in the past, stromatolites occur
   today in a few shallow marine environments, including Hamelin Pool in
   Shark Bay, Western Australia. Hamelin Pool stromatolites often have been
   considered contemporary analogs to ancient stromatolites, yet little is
   known about the microbial communities that build them. We used DNA-based
   molecular phylogenetic methods that do not require cultivation to study
   the microbial diversity of an irregular stromatolite and of the surface
   and interior of a domal stromatolite. To identify the constituents of the
   stromatolite communities, small subunit rRNA genes were amplified by PCR
   from community genomic DNA with universal primers, cloned, sequenced, and
   compared to known rRNA genes. The communities were highly diverse and
   novel. The average sequence identity of Hamelin Pool sequences compared
   to the >200,000 known rRNA sequences was only ∼92%. Clone libraries were
   ∼90% bacterial and ∼10% archaeal, and eucaryotic rRNA genes were not
   detected in the libraries. The most abundant sequences were
   representative of novel proteobacteria (∼28%), planctomycetes (∼17%), and
   actinobacteria (∼14%). Sequences representative of cyanobacteria, long
   considered to dominate these communities, comprised <5% of clones.
   Approximately 10% of the sequences were most closely related to those of
   α-proteobacterial anoxygenic phototrophs. These results provide a
   framework for understanding the kinds of organisms that build
   contemporary stromatolites, their ecology, and their relevance to
   stromatolites preserved in the geological record.

AB Summary Stromatolites have been present on Earth, at various levels of
   distribution and diversity, for more than 3 billion years. Today, the
   best examples of stromatolites forming in hypersaline marine environments
   are in Hamelin Pool at Shark Bay, Western Australia. Despite their
   evolutionary significance, little is known about their associated
   microbial communities. Using a polyphasic approach of culture-dependent
   and culture-independent methods, we report the discovery of a wide range
   of microorganisms associated with these biosedimentary structures. There
   are no comparable reports combining these methodologies in the survey of
   cyanobacteria, bacteria, and archaea in marine stromatolites. The
   community was characterized by organisms of the cyanobacterial genera
   Synechococcus, Xenococcus, Microcoleus, Leptolyngbya, Plectonema,
   Symploca, Cyanothece, Pleurocapsa and Nostoc. We also report the
   discovery of potentially free-living Prochloron. The other eubacterial
   isolates and clones clustered into seven phylogenetic groups: OP9, OP10,
   Marine A group, Proteobacteria, Low G+C Gram-positive, Planctomycetes and
   Acidobacteria. We also demonstrate the presence of sequences
   corresponding to members of halophilic archaea of the divisions
   Euryarchaeota and Crenarchaeota and methanogenic archaea of the order
   Methanosarcinales. This is the first report of such archaeal diversity
   from this environment. This study provides a better understanding of the
   microbial community associated with these living rocks.

AB : Large pelagic vertebrates pose special conservation challenges because
   their movements generally exceed the boundaries of any single
   jurisdiction. To assess the population structure of whale sharks
   (Rhincodon typus), we sequenced complete mitochondrial DNA control
   regions from individuals collected across a global distribution. We
   observed 51 single site polymorphisms and 8 regions with indels
   comprising 44 haplotypes in 70 individuals, with high haplotype (h =
   0.974 +/- 0.008) and nucleotide diversity (pi = 0.011 +/- 0.006). The
   control region has the largest length variation yet reported for an
   elasmobranch (1143-1332 bp). Phylogenetic analyses reveal no geographical
   clustering of lineages and the most common haplotype was distributed
   globally. The absence of population structure across the Indian and
   Pacific basins indicates that oceanic expanses and land barriers in
   Southeast Asia are not impediments to whale shark dispersal. We did,
   however, find significant haplotype frequency differences (AMOVA, Phi(ST)
   = 0.107, P < 0.001) principally between the Atlantic and Indo-Pacific
   populations. In contrast to other recent surveys of globally distributed
   sharks, we find much less population subdivision and no evidence for
   cryptic evolutionary partitions. Discovery of the mating and pupping
   areas of whale sharks is key to further population genetic studies. The
   global pattern of shared haplotypes in whale sharks provides a compelling
   argument for development of broad international approaches for management
   and conservation of Earth's largest fish.

AB Summary 1. Megaplanktivores such as filter-feeding sharks and baleen
   whales are at the apex of a short food chain
   (phytoplankton‐zooplankton‐vertebrate) and are sensitive indicators of
   sea-surface plankton availability. Even though they spend the majority of
   their time below the surface it is still not known how most of these
   species utilize vertical habitat and adapt to short-term changes in food
   availability. 2. A key factor likely to control vertical habitat
   selection by planktivorous sharks is the diel vertical migration (DVM) of
   zooplankton; however, no study has determined whether specific
   ocean-habitat type influences their behavioural strategy. Based on the
   first high-resolution dive data collected for a plankton-feeding fish
   species we show that DVM patterns of the basking shark Cetorhinus maximus
   reflect habitat type and zooplankton behaviour. 3. In deep,
   well-stratified waters sharks exhibited normal DVM (dusk ascent‐dawn
   descent) by tracking migrating sound-scattering layers characterized by
   Calanus and euphausiids. Sharks occupying shallow, inner-shelf areas near
   thermal fronts conducted reverse DVM (dusk descent‐dawn ascent) possibly
   due to zooplankton predator‐prey interactions that resulted in reverse
   DVM of Calanus . 4. These opposite DVM patterns resulted in the
   probability of daytime-surface sighting differing between these habitats
   by as much as two orders of magnitude. Ship-borne surveys undertaken at
   the same time as trackings reflected these behavioural differences. 5.
   The tendency of basking sharks to feed or rest for long periods at the
   surface has made them vulnerable to harpoon fisheries. Ship-borne and
   aerial surveys also use surface occurrence to assess distribution and
   abundance for conservation purposes. Our study indicates that without
   bias reduction for habitat-specific DVM patterns, current surveys could
   under- or overestimate shark abundance by at least 10-fold.

AB Prey availability and predation risk are important determinants of
   habitat use, but their importance may vary across spatial scales. In many
   marine systems, predator and prey distributions covary at large spatial
   scales, but do no coincide at small spatial scales. We investigated the
   influences of prey abundance and tiger shark (Galeocerdo cuvier)
   predation risk on Indian Ocean bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops aduncus)
   habitat use across multiple spatial scales, in Shark Bay, Western
   Australia. Dolphins were distributed between deep and shallow habitats
   and across microhabitats within patches approximately proportional to
   prey density when shark abundance was low. When shark abundance was high,
   foraging dolphins greatly reduced their use of dangerous, but productive,
   shallow patches relative to safer deep ones. Also, dolphins reduced their
   use of interior portions of shallow patches relative to their edges,
   which have higher predator density but lower intrinsic risk (i.e. a
   higher probability of escape in an encounter situation). These results
   suggest that predation risk and prey availability influence dolphin
   habitat use at multiple spatial scales, but intrinsic habitat risk, and
   not just predator encounter rate, is important in shaping dolphin space
   use decisions. Therefore, studies of habitat use at multiple spatial
   scales can benefit from integrating data on prey availability and the
   subcomponents of predation risk.

AB Abstract The use of demographic analyses incorporating life history
   information on validated age and growth, reproduction, and natural
   mortality is proposed to gain insight into the population dynamics of
   sharks under a variety of scenarios and to assess their vulnerability to
   varying exploitation rates. This approach provides a useful framework for
   comparison with other currently used methods of assessment, especially
   those that rely only on fishery-dependent data, and thus can be helpful
   to stock assessments and to the rational exploitation and management of
   shark stocks. A review of demographic analyses of large coastal sharks on
   the east coast of the US indicates that the lemon and sandbar sharks have
   very low rates of population increase ( r −1 ) and are thus extremely
   vulnerable to exploitation. In contrast, one of the small coastal group
   species of lesser importance to the fisheries, the bonnethead shark, has
   some of the highest r values yet calculated for any shark. Preliminary
   demographic analyses using nonvalidated age estimates indicate that two
   other common and economically valuable large coastal species, the
   blacktip and dusky sharks, may also exhibit relatively slow rates of
   population change and be very vulnerable to overexploitation. Improved
   assessment of shark stocks requires increased collection of biological
   and fishery data, and a much better understanding of their population
   dynamics, especially stock–recruitment relationships.

AB SUMMARY It has long been suspected that the denticles on shark skin
   reduce hydrodynamic drag during locomotion, and a number of man-made
   materials have been produced that purport to use shark-skin-like surface
   roughness to reduce drag during swimming. But no studies to date have
   tested these claims of drag reduction under dynamic and controlled
   conditions in which the swimming speed and hydrodynamics of shark skin
   and skin-like materials can be quantitatively compared with those of
   controls lacking surface ornamentation or with surfaces in different
   orientations. We use a flapping foil robotic device that allows accurate
   determination of the self-propelled swimming (SPS) speed of both rigid
   and flexible membrane-like foils made of shark skin and two biomimetic
   models of shark skin to measure locomotor performance. We studied the SPS
   speed of real shark skin, a silicone riblet material with evenly spaced
   ridges and a Speedo® ‘shark skin-like’ swimsuit fabric attached to rigid
   flat-plate foils and when made into flexible membrane-like foils. We
   found no consistent increase in swimming speed with Speedo® fabric, a
   7.2% increase with riblet material, whereas shark skin membranes (but not
   rigid shark skin plates) showed a mean 12.3% increase in swimming speed
   compared with the same skin foils after removing the denticles.
   Deformation of the shark skin membrane is thus crucial to the
   drag-reducing effect of surface denticles. Digital particle image
   velocimetry (DPIV) of the flow field surrounding moving shark skin foils
   shows that skin denticles promote enhanced leading-edge suction, which
   might have contributed to the observed increase in swimming speed. Shark
   skin denticles might thus enhance thrust, as well as reduce drag.

AB The conservation and management of sharks on a species-specific basis is
   a pressing need because of the escalating demand for shark fins and the
   recognition that individual shark species respond differently to
   exploitation. Difficulties with the identification of many commonly
   fished sharks and their body parts has resulted in a global dearth of
   catch and trade information, making reliable assessment of exploitation
   effects and conservation needs for individual species nearly impossible.
   We developed and tested a highly stream- lined molecular genetic approach
   based on species-specific, polymerase-chain-reaction primers in an eight-
   primer multiplex format to discriminate simultaneously between body parts
   from six shark species common in worldwide pelagic fisheries. The
   species-specific primers are based on DNA sequence differences among spe-
   cies in the nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer 2 locus. The
   primers and multiplex format accu- rately and sensitively distinguished
   samples from each of three lamnid ( Isurus oxyrinchus , Isurus paucus ,
   and Lamna nasus ) and three carcharhinid ( Prionace glauca , Carcharhinus
   obscurus , and Carcharhinus falciformis ) species from all but one other
   shark species encountered in the North Atlantic fishery. Furthermore, the
   three lamnid primers were robust enough in their discriminatory power to
   be useful for species diagnosis on a glo- bal scale. Preliminary testing
   of dried fins from Asian and Mediterranean commercial markets suggests
   that our genetic approach will be useful for determining the species of
   origin of detached fins, thus allowing the monitoring of trade in shark
   fins for conservation assessment. Our approach will also facilitate
   detection of products from protected and other at-risk shark species and
   may prove useful as a model for development of the high-throughput,
   genetic, species-diagnosis methods typically required in conservation and
   management contexts.

AB Free-ranging female grey reef sharks, Carcharhinus amblyrhynchos, were
   observed forming daily aggregations offshore Sand Island, Johnston Atoll
   between March and late May from 1992 to 1995. Daily water temperatures
   were recorded at the aggregation area from 1993 to 1995. The annual
   aggregation cycle did not coincide with maximum or minimum annual water
   temperatures. During the 1994 aggregation, temperatures were recorded at
   least every hour at 7 sites in the Atoll. The sharks aggregated most
   frequently and in highest numbers at the largest and shallowest site,
   which also contained the fewest underwater structures. The water
   temperature at this site was 1–2 °C warmer than at neighboring sites and
   at a reef channel between the lagoon and the open ocean. The pattern of
   movement of sharks to and from the aggregation area was correlated with
   daily fluctuations of water temperature (r=0.38; p < 0.001), tide
   (r=0.30; p < 0.001) and light level (r=0.21; p < 0.001) after adjustment
   for autocorrelated errors. The daily maximum number of aggregating sharks
   coincided with the daily maximum water temperature. However, the number
   of aggregating sharks did not necessarily increase during days of higher
   water temperature. During the 1994 aggregation period, four sharks were
   fed ultrasonic telemetry tags, and telemetry stations were deployed at
   three sites within the aggregation area. Individual sharks were tracked
   returning to the aggregation area for durations of one to five days. The
   end of detection of tagged sharks is thought to be due to the
   regurgitation of the indigestible tags, rather than the sharks permanent
   departure from the aggregating area. Sharks aggregated only during the
   day; none of the tagged sharks were recorded and no sharks were ever seen
   at the aggregation area during night time.

   Montauk Point, New York to Hudson Canyon. It made a number of brief
   excursions to the surface and to the bottom, but usually swam in the
   thermocline. Muscle temperature of the shark was as much as 5 C warmer
   than the water, confirming that a system of large retia mirabilia in the
   circulatory system function as heat exchangers. The shark did not
   thermoregulate and muscle temperature changed slowly as water temperature
   changed. The warming of the muscle as the shark swam into warmer water
   allowed us to estimate its rate of metabolism. The rate obtained is low
   and despite being warm, it appears that the shark can maintain itself for
   more than a month on a single large meal. The implications of this for
   its feeding habits are discussed.

   employed; sample size; tag attachment and deployment technique; duration
   of tracking; tag failure rate; and study limitation. The potential
   impacts of tagging on shark behavior and physiology are considered.
   Finally, we discuss how satellite tagging has furthered our current

   developments that can improve our ability to resolve the mechanisms
   underlying shark habitat use.

   quantitative studies on the foraging ecology of sharks have been
   published. Stomach contents and catch data of early life stages of
   Atlantic sharpnose Rhizoprionodon terraenovae, blacktip Carcharhinus
   limbatus, finetooth Carcharhinus isodon, and spinner sharks Carcharhinus
   brevipinna taken from fishery independent surveys in Apalachicola Bay,
   Florida, USA, were examined to test for overlap in resource use.
   Young-of-the-year Atlantic sharpnose sharks were found to feed mainly on
   shrimp, juveniles on sciaenids, and adults on clupeids. Young-of-the-year
   blacktip sharks were found to feed mainly on sciaenids, whereas juveniles
   fed on clupeids. The primary prey of young-of-the-year and juvenile
   finetooth and spinner sharks was clupeids. Eight of 10 prey
   size-selectivity tests showed neutral selection. Compared to relative
   prey sizes published for teleost piscivores, Atlantic sharpnose and
   finetooth sharks consume relatively small-sized prey while blacktip
   sharks consume relatively large prey. Regardless of maturity state and
   species, diet overlap was high for species-life stage combinations that
   are similar in size; however, species-life stages did not show
   significant habitat overlap. Prey categories shared by similar-sized
   species may not be limiting, although shark species may have alleviated
   competition pressure by partitioning the resource of time or space.

AB Abstract This paper reviews current knowledge on shark biology, ecology,
   and fisheries in Mexican waters of the Gulf of Mexico, focusing on
   management implications. Original and literature data are summarized
   covering distribution, migrations, nursery areas, structure of the
   landings and catch trends. There are at least 34 species of shark in the
   area, most of them from the genera Carcharhinus and Sphyrna. Fourteen of
   these species are important in the fisheries. The biology and ecology of
   shark stocks in the southern Gulf of Mexico are poorly known. Tagging
   studies have shown movements of shark from the eastern US coast to the
   southern Gulf of Mexico, but migrations have not been properly
   characterized due to limited tagging in Gulf waters. There are important
   shark nurseries for at least five species in the protected waters of
   Chetumal Bay (Q. Roo), Yalahau Lagoon (Q. Roo), and Terminos Lagoon
   (Camp.). Sharks contribute approximately 3.5% of the total fishery
   catches in this region, averaging about 13000 t during 1983–1992. Sharks
   are harvested by a diverse fleet of small-scale and large-scale vessels
   utilizing longlines or gillnets. There seems to be an excessive fishing
   of juveniles from many of the most important species. Areas of priority
   for future research that are pre-requisite for international management
   are: the life cycle of the main species in the southern Gulf of Mexico;
   in-depth study of coastal nursery areas; large scale tagging programmes
   coupled with population genetics studies; gathering of fisheries data and
   fisheries-independent abundance information; and socio-economic studies
   of the fisheries. Some precautionary management measures are proposed.

AB Abstract A mouse brain chondroitin sulfate (CS) proteoglycan, DSD-1-PG,
   bears the DSD-1 epitope and has neurite outgrowth promoting properties.
   Shark cartilage CS-C inhibits the interactions between the DSD-1-specific
   monoclonal antibody 473HD and the CS chains of the DSD-1-PG, which is
   expressed on the mouse glial cells (Faissner, A., Clement, A., Lochter,
   A., Streit, A., Mandl, C., and Schachner, M. (1994) J. Cell Biol. 126,
   783–799). On the other hand, several hexasaccharides isolated from
   commercial shark cartilage CS-D, which contains a higher proportion of
   characteristic D units (GlcUA(2-sulfate)β1–3GalNAc(6-sulfate)) as
   compared with CS-C, has the A-D tetrasaccharide sequence composed of an A
   disaccharide unit (GlcUAβ1–3GalNAc(4-sulfate)) and a D disaccharide unit
   (Nadanaka, S. and Sugahara, K. (1997) Glycobiology 7, 253–263). In this
   study, the biological activities and the structure of shark cartilage
   CS-D were investigated. CS-D inhibited the interactions between
   monoclonal antibody 473HD and DSD-1-PG and also promoted neurite
   outgrowth of embryonic day 18 hippocampal neurons. Eight octasaccharide
   fractions were isolated from CS-D after partial digestion with bacterial
   chondroitinase ABC by means of gel filtration chromatography and
   anion-exchange high performance liquid chromotography to investigate the
   frequency and the arrangement of the A-D tetrasaccharide unit in the
   polymer sequence. Structural analysis performed by a combination of
   enzymatic digestions with 500-MHz 1H NMR spectroscopy demonstrated that
   the isolated octasaccharides shared the common core structure
   ΔHexAα1–3GalNAcβ1–4(GlcUAβ1–3GalNAc)3 with four, five, and six sulfate
   esters at various hydroxyl groups in different combinations. In the
   structure, ΔHexA and GlcUA represent
   4-deoxy-α-l-threo-hex-4-enepyranosyluronic acid and glucuronic acid,
   respectively. No D-D tetrasaccharide sequence was found, and discrete D
   disaccharide units were demonstrated exclusively as A-D tetrasaccharide
   units in either an A-D-A or an A-D-C hexasaccharide sequence in the five
   octasaccharides that represented about 5.0% (w/w) of the starting
   polysaccharides (C denotes the disaccharide GlcUAβ1–3GalNAc(6-sulfate)).
   It remains to be determined whether such characteristic hexasaccharide
   sequences present in shark cartilage CS-D serve as functional domain
   structures recognized by some protein ligands.

AB Recent studies have shown that by 1991 the sandbar shark (Carcharhinus
   plumbeus) population along the Atlantic coast of the United States had
   declined in abundance to approximately 20% of its level in the late
   1970s. This phenomenon allowed us to test the hypothesis that
   compensatory (density-dependent) growth occurred after severe population
   reduction. Age and growth of sandbar sharks were investigated by counting
   rings and back-calculating lengths at previous ages from vertebral
   samples collected in 1980-1981 and 1991-1992. The collections included
   188 sharks from 1980-1981 and 412 sharks from 1990-1991 ranging in length
   from 51-172 cm precaudal length (PCL). All sharks were mature at lengths
   > 136 cm PCL. Minimum and maximum ring counts, which included a birth
   mark, were 1 and 25. Age at maturity was 15-16 years for both sample
   periods and both sexes. For sexes combined, the von Bertalanffy growth
   parameters were L,. = 199 cm PCL, K = 0.057, to = -4.9 years for the
   1980-1981 sample and L,. = 164 cm PCL, K = 0.089, to = -3.8 years for the
   1991-1992 sample. Statistical tests found significant differences between
   the two growth models. Significant differences in size at age and annual
   incremental growth of juveniles suggest a small increase in juvenile
   sandbar shark growth rate between the two sampling periods. However, age
   at maturity was unchanged between samples suggesting that any biological
   significance of a growth rate increase has not been realized.

AB Artisanal shark fisheries have been an important source of food and
   employment in Mexico for many years. In the Gulf of Mexico, this
   multispecific fishery is based on the seasonal abundance of several shark
   and teleost species. To obtain fishery and biological information needed
   to manage the fishery and conserve shark stocks, intensive monitoring of
   artisanal shark landings was undertaken from November 1993 to December
   1994. The State of Campeche had the highest landings and effort. October
   1994 had the highest monthly catch per unit effort for all species and
   areas combined (27.2 sharks per trip). Rhizoprionodon terraenovae (46%),
   Sphyrna tiburo (15%), and Carcharhinus limbatus (11%) accounted for most
   of the landings numerically, and the highest catch per unit effort for C.
   limbatus occurred late in the year as a result of increased landings
   attributable to an annual southward migration from USA to Mexican waters.
   The high proportion of neonate and juvenile sharks in gill-net catches
   from shallow coastal waters suggests that the main shark nursery areas
   are under heavy fishing pressure. In light of the heavy exploitation of
   shark resources, the Mexican National Fisheries Institute recommends a
   number of precautionary actions to avoid the collapse of this fishery.

   informacion biologico-pesquera necesaria para manejar la pesqueria y
   conservar los stocks de tiburones, se realizo un monitoreo de las
   capturas artesanales de tiburon entre noviembre de 1993 y diciembre de
   1994. Campeche presento las mayores capturas y esfuerzo. En octubre de
   1994 se registraron las mayores CPUE para todas las especies y areas
   combinadas (27.2 tiburones por viaje). Rhizoprionodon terraenovae (46%),
   Sphyrna tiburo (15%) y Carcharhinus limbatus (11%) constituyeron la
   mayoria de las capturas numericamente y las mayores CPUE para C. limbatus
   se produjeron hacia finales de ano a consecuencia del aumento de las
   capturas atribuible a una migracion anual norte-sur desde los E.U. hacia
   aguas mexicanas. La alta proporcion de neonatos y juveniles capturados en
   redes agalleras en aguas costeras someras sugiere que las principales
   areas de crianza estan sometidas a una alta presion de pesca. En vista de
   los niveles de explotacion el INP recomienda diversas medidas
   precautorias para evitar el colapso de la pesqueria.

AB Abstract Increasing fishing pressure on sharks stocks over recent decades
   has resulted in declines of many populations and led to increasing
   concerns for their conservation. The extent of these declines, however,
   has been highly variable—the result of the level of fishing, ocean
   conditions, and the life history of individual species. Two recent
   articles have described the collapse and possible extirpation of shark
   populations in the northwest Atlantic Ocean and Gulf of Mexico. Herein,
   we examine the results of these two papers commenting on the data sets
   used, comparing them to other available data sets, and critically
   evaluating the analyses and conclusions. We argue that these conclusions
   have been overstated because: (1) the analyses were based on a limited
   number of data sets, (2) the data sets themselves are inadequate to
   describe the status of all shark populations in the northwest Atlantic
   Ocean and Gulf of Mexico reported in these studies, (3) available data

AB SUMMARY Growth parameters were estimated for porbeagle shark (Lamna
   nasus) in the northwest Atlantic Ocean on the basis of vertebral annuli.
   A total of 578 vertebrae was analyzed. Annuli were validated up to an age
   of 11 years by using vertebrae from recaptured oxytetracyclineinjected
   and known age sharks. Males and females grew at similar rates until the
   size of male sexual maturity, after which the relative growth of the
   males declined. The growth rate of the females declined in a similar
   manner at the onset of maturity. Growth curves were consistent with those
   derived from tag/recapture analyses (GROTAG) of 76 recaptured fish, and
   with length-frequency methods using measurements from 13,589 individuals.
   Von Bertalanffy growth curve parameters (combined sexes) were: L∞ = 289.4
   cm fork length, K = 0.07 and t0 = -6.06. Maximum age, based on vertebral
   band pair counts, was 25 and 24 years for males and females,
   respectively. Longevity calculations, however, indicated a maximum age of
   45 to 46 years in an unfished population. RESUME

AB Shark nets have been set off the beaches of KwaZulu–Natal, South Africa,
   since 1952 to reduce the risk of shark attack. The nets fish in fixed
   localities 400 m from shore and both directly affect local shark
   populations and act as fisheries-independent monitoring devices. Reliable
   catch information at the species level was available for the period
   1978–2003. Trends in catch rate and size were used to assess the
   population status of 14 commonly caught shark species. In addition, a
   demographic modelling approach was used in conjunction with the catch
   information to assess the potential effect of the nets on populations.
   Catch rates of four species (Carcharhinus leucas, C. limbatus, Sphyrna
   lewini and S. mokarran) showed a significant decline, as did the mean or
   median length of three species (Carcharhinus amboinensis, C. limbatus and
   female Carcharodon carcharias). For three species that showed declining
   catch rates or length the potential effect of the shark nets was assessed
   to be low, suggesting that other sources of catch were responsible for
   the declining status. The potential effect of the shark nets was assessed
   to be high for two species (Carcharhinus obscurus and Carcharias taurus,
   neither of which showed declines in catch rate or length), because of
   very low intrinsic rates of population increase.

AB Concern over declining shark populations has led to an intense interest
   in their conservation and management. Due to the difficulties involved in
   managing adult sharks, focus has been placed on young juvenile and
   neonate age classes that inhabit discrete inshore nursery areas. However,
   past confusion over what qualifies as a nursery habitat has led to the
   identification of vast coastal areas as nurseries, making conservation
   unfeasible. With the establishment of more discerning criteria for
   nursery area identification such concerns have been somewhat alleviated,
   but while effort has been put into defining, identifying, mapping, and in
   some cases protecting nursery areas, little attention has been paid to
   the practical value of nurseries for the recovery of exploited shark
   populations. Often neonate and young juveniles are considered the most
   critical age classes in terms of population stability/recovery, but
   evidence is mounting that suggests life stages outside the nursery may be
   more important in this regard. While nursery area protection should
   remain a component in shark management strategies it will be critical to
   link early life stage conservation with management strategies that
   encompass older individuals residing outside nurseries if effective
   management is to be achieved.

AB An extensive bank of carbonate sediment is forming along the eastern
   margin of Shark Bay, Western Australia. Development of the bank is
   attributed partly to the modifying influence of seagrasses on the
   physical environment. Bank formation under organic cover elucidates the
   origin of older moundlike bodies of carbonate sediment which lack an
   internal skeletal framework. The bank covers 400 sq mi (1,036 sq km) and
   is 80 mi (129 km) long; average width is 5 mi (8 km). In cross section
   the bank is wedge-shaped, and the maximum sediment thickness of about 25
   ft (7.6 m) is at the seaward margin. For descriptive purposes, the bank
   is divided into two intergradational structural forms--the basal sheet
   and the submarine levees. The basal sheet pinches out landward beneath
   younger intertidal and supratidal sand sheets, thus recording the
   progressive seaward advance (regression) of the bank. The submarine
   levees are forming at the margins of tidal channels, and are now the most
   active centers of deposition and seaward widening of the bank. More than
   50 tidal channels cut across the bank. Substrates in the sublittoral
   environments of the bank are covered in varied density by three seagrass
   communities: (1) the Posidonia community, (2) the Posidonia-algal
   community, and (3) the Cymodocea community. Seagrasses influence
   sedimentation by (1) postmortem accumulation of skeletal carbonate from
   the epibiota and sheltered benthos, (2) trapping of particles and
   protection of substrates by the leaf baffle, (3) stabilization of
   sediment by the rhizome and root mesh, (4) colonization of new substrates
   by vegetative reproduction, and (5) modification of the chemical
   environment above and below the sediment-water interface. Bank sediments
   are mainly biogenic carbonate sediments but include admixtures of
   terrigenous detrital grains (quartz). In the sublittoral environment,
   skeletal fragments of encrusting foraminifers and articulate coralline
   algae from the seagrass epibiota characterize sediments deposited under
   seagrass cover. Sediments below dense seagrass cover contain up to 30
   percent by weight of fine particles (<62µ), most of which are silt-size
   skeletal fragments of magnesium-calcite composition. Older carbonate
   mounds or "banks" may have been formed as a result of the influence of an
   external organic cover or baffle other than seagrasses. Where the organic
   cover, like seagrass, is not preserved in the sediment body, its former
   existence may be inferred by the presence of detached encrusting
   organisms and a large proportion of silt- and clay-size skeletal
   fragments.

AB We examined population substructure of bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops sp).
   in Shark Bay, Western Australia, using 10 highly polymorphic
   microsatellite loci, and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). For microsatellite
   analysis, 302 different animals were sampled from seven localities
   throughout the bay. Analysis of genetic differentiation between sampling
   localities showed a significant correlation between the number of
   migrants (Nm) calculated from FST, RST and private alleles, and distance
   between localities–a pattern of isolation-by-distance. For mtDNA, 220
   individuals from all seven localities were sequenced for a 351 base pair
   fragment of the control region, resulting in eight haplotypes, with two
   distinct clusters of haplotypes. Values of FST and (φ)ST for mtDNA
   yielded statistically significant differences, mostly between localities
   that were not adjacent to each other, suggesting female gene flow over a
   scale larger than the sampled localities. We also observed a significant
   correlation between the number of female migrants calculated from FST and
   φST and the distance of sampling localities. Our results indicate that
   dispersal in female dolphins in Shark Bay is more restricted than that of
   males.

AB Although many coastal shark species have widespread distributions, the
   genetic relatedness of worldwide populations has been examined for few
   species. The blacktip shark, (Carcharhinus limbatus), inhabits tropical
   and subtropical coastal waters throughout the world. In this study, we
   examined the genetic relationships of blacktip shark populations (n = 364
   sharks) throughout the majority of the species' range using the entire
   mitochondrial control region (1067-1070 nucleotides). Two geographically
   distinct maternal lineages (western Atlantic, Gulf of Mexico, and
   Caribbean Sea clades, and eastern Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific Ocean
   clades) were identified and shallow population structure was detected
   throughout their geographic ranges. These findings indicate that a major
   population subdivision exists across the Atlantic Ocean, but not the
   Pacific Ocean. The historical dispersal of this widespread, coastal
   species may have been interrupted by the rise of the Isthmus of Panama.
   This scenario implies historical dispersal across the Pacific Ocean
   (supported by the recovery of the same common haplotype from the
   Philippines, Hawaii, and the Gulf of California reflecting
   recent/contemporary dispersal abilities) and an oceanic barrier to recent
   migration across the Atlantic. Genetic structure within the eastern
   Atlantic/Indo-Pacific (Phi(ST) = 0.612, P < 0.001) supports maternal
   philopatry throughout this area, expanding previous western Atlantic
   findings. Eastern Atlantic/Indo-Pacific C. limbatus control region
   haplotypes were paraphyletic to Carcharhinus tilstoni haplotypes in our
   maximum-parsimony analysis. The greater divergence of western Atlantic C.
   limbatus than C. tilstoni from eastern Atlantic/Indo-Pacific C. limbatus
   reflects the taxonomic uncertainty of western Atlantic C. limbatus.

AB A large, sea-going water tunnel was used in various studies of shark
   swimming performance. The critical swimming velocity (Ucrit, an index of
   aerobically sustainable swimming speed) of a 70 cm long lemon shark (
   Negaprion brevirostris Poey) was determined to be 1.1 Ls−1, where L is
   body length. The Ucrit of the leopard shark ( Triakis semifasciata
   Girard) was found to vary inversely with body size; from about 1.6Ls−1in
   30–50cm sharks to 0.6LS−1 in 120cm sharks. Large Triakis adopt ram gill
   ventilation at swimming speeds between 27 and 60cms−1, which is similar
   to the speed at which this transition occurs in teleosts. Analyses of
   tail-beat frequency (TBF) in relation to velocity and body size show that
   smaller Triakis have a higher TBF and can swim at higher relative speeds.
   TBF, however, approaches a maximal value at speeds approaching Ucrit,
   suggesting that red muscle contraction velocity may limit sustained
   swimming speed. The TBF of both Triakis and Negaprion rises at a faster
   rate with swimming velocity than does that of the more thunniform mako
   shark ( Isurus oxyrinchus Rafinesque). This is consistent with the
   expectation that, at comparable relative speeds, sharks adapted for
   efficient swimming should have a lower TBF. The rates of O2 consumption
   of swimming lemon and mako sharks are among the highest yet measured for
   elasmobranchs and are comparable to those of cruise-adapted teleosts.

AB Abstract The 10th human fibronectin type III domain ( 10 Fn3) is one of
   several protein scaffolds used to design and select families of proteins
   that bind with high affinity and specificity to macromolecular targets.
   To date, the highest affinity 10 Fn3 variants have been selected by mRNA
   display of libraries generated by randomizing all three
   complementarity-determining region -like loops of the 10 Fn3 scaffold.
   The sub-nanomolar affinities of such antibody mimics have been attributed
   to the extremely large size of the library accessible by mRNA display (10
   12 unique sequences). Here we describe the selection and affinity
   maturation of 10 Fn3-based antibody mimics with dissociation constants as
   low as 350 pM selected from significantly smaller libraries (10 7 –10 9
   different sequences), which were constructed by randomizing only 14 10
   Fn3 residues. The finding that two adjacent loops in human 10 Fn3 provide
   a large enough variable surface area to select high-affinity antibody
   mimics is significant because a smaller deviation from wild-type 10 Fn3
   sequence is associated with a higher stability of selected antibody
   mimics. Our results also demonstrate the utility of an
   affinity-maturation strategy that led to a 340-fold improvement in
   affinity by maximizing sampling of sequence space close to the original
   selected antibody mimic. A striking feature of the highest affinity
   antibody mimics selected against lysozyme is a pair of cysteines on
   adjacent loops, in positions 28 and 77, which are critical for the
   affinity of the 10 Fn3 variant for its target and are close enough to
   form a disulfide bond. The selection of this cysteine pair is
   structurally analogous to the natural evolution of disulfide bonds found
   in new antigen receptors of cartilaginous fish and in camelid heavy-chain
   variable domains. We propose that future library designs incorporating
   such an interloop disulfide will further facilitate the selection of
   high-affinity, highly stable antibody mimics from libraries accessible to
   phage and yeast surface display methods.

   seagrasses and traces of mollusks, teleosts, and other material. A
   significant prey/predator length relationship was found for C. sapidus
   and S. tiburo. Contingency table analysis and measures of dietary overlap
   and diet breadth were used to detect seasonal, sex, size, locality, and
   habitat-related quantitative differences in stomach contents. Results
   suggest that S. tiburo is a specialist that undergoes dietary shifts
   depending on season and habitat. Discontinuity of feeding was
   investigated using two different statistical techniques and results
   varied by method, revealing the shortcomings of the most commonly used
   approach and the limited value of considering only stomach contents
   weight to investigate diel feeding chronology.

   the distribution and dietary over- lap of the 4 most abundant
   carcharhinid sharks. Tiger sharks Galeorcerdo cuvier and Galapagos sharks
   Carcharhinus galapagensis were caught at all islands, but were more
   abundant in the north- western Hawaiian Islands (NWHI) than in the main
   Hawaiian Islands (MHI). Gray reef sharks Carcharhinus amblyrhynchos and
   sandbar sharks Carcharhinus plumbeus showed an inverse rela- tionship in
   distribution, with sandbar sharks abundant in the MHI, but virtually
   absent throughout the NWHI, and gray reef sharks only sporadically found
   throughout the MHI, but abundant in the NWHI. Dietary overlap was high
   between gray reef and sandbar sharks, and between sandbar and Galapagos
   sharks. Tiger sharks had low dietary overlap with all other species,
   except for large Gala- pagos sharks. The data analyzed in our study
   support the hypothesis that interspecific competition influences the
   distribution of carcharhinid sharks throughout the Hawaiian Archipelago.

   in dolphins, with TBT highest in the muscle and DBT in the liver.

AB A rich engineering literature exists that is applicable to many aspects
   of vertebrate jaw mechanics and has been referred to in many studies in
   this sector. But mechanical engineering technology has provided few
   theoretical bases that are directly helpful in the study of predator
   teeth. Hence, analyses of puncturing and slicing functions of these teeth
   have lacked a firm physical technology as a background. Predator teeth
   have evolved to pierce and cut animal tissues that are usually compliant
   in that they readily undergo relatively large deformations under applied
   stress before they actually yield. The bulk of engineering theory is
   directed toward such noncompliant materials as wood and metal, the design
   of tools that cut them, and the mechanics involved in this. The purpose
   of the present paper is to scan the mechanical implications of different
   tooth designs, pose hypotheses that relate to primary considerations of
   the physics of cutting compliant substrates, and offer a preliminary
   approach that is intended as a useful guide to further studies on sharks
   and on other vertebrate groups. Thus, in this paper I have attempted to
   formulate some tentative and preliminary generalizations concerning the
   mechanics of cutting compliant materials. Then comes a survey of the
   teeth of a particular group of predators, three families of sharks, in
   terms of these preliminary formulations. The approach views the shark
   teeth in isolation from the complex cranial mechanism (presently under
   study) that functionally integrates with the teeth. Therefore, adaptive
   conclusions are minimal, because the evolutionary significance of tooth
   form cannot properly be assessed outside of an integrated study. However,
   certain correlations do exist between structural tooth characteristics
   and mechanics. Slender, smooth-edged (or nearly so) teeth can readily
   pierce prey, but are of less use in slicing it. Such teeth are typical of
   the lower jaw dentition in many sharks and, in a few species, they are
   present in both upper and lower jaws. Usually these slender teeth display
   a reversed curvature at their tips, so that although most of the tooth's
   crown is curved inward toward the mouth cavity, the tip is turned
   outward. This outward turning of the tip can enhance the probability of
   initial prey penetration, without much compromising the prey-retaining
   properties of the inward curvature of the greater, more proximal portion
   of the tooth. Many sharks possess upper teeth with serrations along the
   edges. The serrations vary from one species to another in coarseness and
   in distribution along tooth edges. Serrated teeth can make greater use of
   the available biting forces, and they have a greater cutting effect than
   do smooth-edged teeth. These latter depend upon friction which, because
   the coefficient friction is always less than 1.0 (often very much less),
   can make use of only a fraction of the total bite force. However, smooth
   tooth blades can pierce prey with less resistance and are less prone to
   binding (becoming immobilized) in the prey tissue. In many shark species
   serrations are concentrated along the proximal portions of the tooth
   crown, where the bases of adjacent teeth are in near contact along the
   jaw margin. In these regions food can be pressed during feeding,
   resulting in a binding of the teeth in the prey. Release of the binding
   must be accomplished by cutting the jammed food, to permit clearance of
   the prey material so it can slip past the tooth rows. The more prominent
   serrations in such regions may act to puncture and slice the jammed
   tissue. It is noted that commercial saws are typically designed in
   various ways to promote clearance between adjacent saw teeth. The pitch
   or rake of the teeth of sharks is discussed, as is the overall form of
   the tooth rows along the jaw margins. The relationship between the
   distribution of teeth along the jaw margins and surface irregularities of
   the prey surfaces is also considered.

   function is fitted directly to catch data for a number of different mesh
   sizes, with the parameters of the selectivity function being estimated

AB Summary. A study of Cetorhinus maximus of the north-eastern Atlantic was
   made in the Hebrides, where a number of specimens were examined and
   dissected. Though it is often stated that Basking sharks reach a length
   of 40 feet or more, few, if any, exceed 30 feet in a straight line from
   the tip of the snout to the notch of the caudal fin. None of those
   measured in the Hebrides exceeded 29 feet in this dimension. The maximum
   weight appears to be a little over four tons. The general colour is very
   dark grey, but there is a tendency for lighter and darker areas of grey
   to form a pattern of longitudinal streaks. Patches of white are generally
   present on the ventral surface, and are sometimes of considerable extent.
   The placoid scales of simple type cover most of the body, their basal
   plates forming a complete mosaic. In some parts of the body parallel
   sulci which appear to correspond with lines of flexure of the skin are
   almost completely devoid of denticles. The teeth are simple modifications
   of the placoid scale and, owing to the presence of vestigial secondary
   cusps, are asymmetrical except near the median line. There are six rows
   of teeth in the upper jaw, nine in the lower. The snout in the juvenile
   is longer and more pointed than in the adult, but the extreme forms that
   have been reported may have been produced by post-mortem shrinkage of the
   ampullary mass above the rostral cartilage. The sudden increase in girth
   at the level of the pharyngeal region, which has been described as a
   juvenile character, is probably entirely produced by distortion. The skin
   lining the mouth and pharynx is smooth at the anterior end but covered
   with papillae behind. The papillae increase in size and complexity from
   before backwards; they are low and rounded in front, tall and conical
   further back, long and branched at the oesophagus into which they project
   as a large bunch forming a valve. The stomach is siphonal in shape, with
   a large partly sacculated cardiac portion, and narrow pyloric limb. The
   mucosa is beset with crypts; into those of the cardiac part numerous
   large glands open. The semi liquid contents of the cardiac sac weigh
   about half a ton, and consist of disintegrating planktonic crustacea
   mixed with a great quantity of mucus. Removal of water at the beginning
   of the pyloric limb must be rapid, for this limb contains a thick, dark
   red paste. The distal end of the pyloric limb is expanded to form the
   bursa entiana before joining the duodenum. The bursa contains a clear red
   oil derived from the paste in the proximal part of the limb. Histological
   examination shows that the oil is probably absorbed by the epithelium of
   the bursa. The bile and pancreatic ducts open into the duodenum, a
   chamber proximal to the first turn of the spiral valve, but not
   externally separated from the mid intestine. The valve, which is a simple
   spiral shelf, contains up to about fifty turns. The mucosa of the valve
   is covered with villi each closely beset with glands; a stratum of
   lymphoid tissue lies beneath the glands. The colon and rectum are
   comparatively short, but there is a large rectal gland lined by a thick
   glandular mucosa. Full histological details are given of the various
   parts of the alimentary canal, and of the liver, pancreas, and spleen;
   and the topography of the abdominal viscera and their mesenteries is
   described. The brain is small in proportion to the size of the animal,
   and lies in a voluminous perimeningeal space supported by innumerable
   fine strands of tissue. The olfactory tracts are narrow and elongated,
   exceeding the remainder of the brain in length. The olfactory organ is a
   modification of the simple type found in many smaller elasmobranchs, and
   is arranged so that a continuous stream of water enters at a scoop-like
   funnel, passes over the nasal mucosa spread out on a number of plates,
   and leaves by a backwardly directed exhaust funnel. Details of the
   lateral line system are given as far as it was investigated; the majority
   of the ampullae of Lorenzini are concentrated into a mass which occupies
   the whole of the space above the rostral cartilage. The gill arches each
   carry from 1000 to 1300 gill rakers up to 10 cm. long, their free ends
   directed towards the mouth. When the mouth is opened the rakers are
   erected by contraction of a complex of muscle strands connecting the
   bases of the rakers to the branchial cartilages: when it is shut they are
   returned to a position flat on the surface of the arches by the action of
   elastic fibres. It is suggested that plankton filtered off by the rakers
   is entangled in muous secreted by the epithelium at their bases, and that
   the mixture is squeezed out into the mouth when the rakers collapse. The
   details of the gill filaments are described, and the total respiratory
   surface in a shark 7.0 metres long is calculated to be of the order of
   270 sq. metres. The functional significance of this comparatively large
   area is pointed out. Among the contents of the stomach it was possible to
   recognize fish eggs of several species, Calanus and other copepods, and
   larvae of cirripedes and decapods; there were no indications of organisms
   larger than Calanus. The plankton-remains in the stomach are very
   fragmentary, and appear to have been subjected not only to chemical
   disintegration but also to mechanical breakdown, possibly by a churning
   action of the stomach muscles and crushing movements of the gill rakers.
   The net weight of solid organic matter in the stomach contents was less
   than 30 per cent. of the total, and mucus accounted for a considerable
   part of it. The organic solids contain approximately 7 to 8 per cent. of
   the clear, red astacene-containing oil which is separated out in the
   bursa entiana. When feeding the Basking shark swims at a rate of about
   two knots, and calculation shows that at this speed a shark of average
   size would filter over two thousand tons of sea water an hour. The fish
   swims with the mouth widely open and the gills and pharyngeal region
   greatly expanded, feeding and respiration being simultaneous and almost
   automatic. The basking habit, in which the first dorsal fin and the tip
   of the tail project above the surface of the water is probably adopted
   when the concentration of plankton is great near the surface; it is
   likely that feeding also takes place when the fish are completely
   submerged. The basking habit is probably correlated also with the
   breeding behaviour of the fish. All the sharks seen at close quarters at
   sea carried one or more lampreys attached to the skin, and all dead fish
   examined bore superficial marks caused by the suckers of lampreys. The
   denticles appear to form an armouring too hard for lampreys to penetrate,
   for no wounds attributable to them were seen. The large parasitic copepod
   Dinematura producta was common on the skin of the sharks examined.
   Comparison of the extensive material collected with that from other hosts
   shows that there are at least three host-forms of the copepod. The
   differences lie in the organs of prehension and adhesion; they may be
   ecoptypic in origin, their form being determined by the nature of the
   host-skin on which the larvae settle. The parasites erode the skin of the
   host sufficiently to expose the basal plates of the denticles, but
   examination of the gut contents failed to disclose any recognizable blood
   corpuscles, and it is possible that the food is no more substantial than
   mucus. Another parasitic copepod, Nemesis lamna, was numerous on the
   gills where it causes extensive though superficial damage to the
   filaments, the mucosa being cut up by the parasite and hypertrophied to
   three times its normal thickness. Two species of cestodes of the genus
   Dinobothrium, one of them new to science, were found in the spiral valve,
   and have formed the subject of a separate report.

AB A review of past behavioral ultrasonic telemetry studies of sharks and
   rays is presented together with previously unpublished material on the
   behavior of the lemon shark, Negaprion brevirostris, around the Bimini
   Islands, Bahamas. The review, focusing on movement behaviors of 20 shark
   and three ray species, reveals that elasmobranchs exhibit a variety of
   temporal and spatial patterns in terms of rates-of-movement and vertical
   as well as horizontal migrations. The lack of an apparent pattern in a
   few species is probably attributable to the scarcity of tracking data.
   Movements are probably governed by several factors, some still not
   studied, but data show that food, water temperature, bottom type, and
   magnetic gradient play major roles in a shark's decision of where and
   when to swim. A few species exhibit differences in behavior between
   groups of sharks within the same geographical area. This interesting
   finding warrants further research to evaluate the causes of these
   apparent differences and whether these groups constitute different
   subpopulations of the same species. The lack of telemetry data on batoids
   and some orders of sharks must be addressed before we can gain a more
   comprehensive understanding of the behavior of elasmobranch fishes.
   Previously unpublished data from 47 smaller and 38 larger juvenile lemon
   sharks, collected over the decade 1988–1998, provide new results on
   movement patterns, habitat selection, activity rhythms, swimming speed,
   rate-of-movement, and homing behavior. From these results we conclude
   that the lemon shark is an active predator with a strong, apparently
   innate homing mechanism. This species shows ontogenetic differences in
   habitat selection and behavior, as well as differences in movements
   between groups of individuals within the same area. We suggest three
   hypotheses for future research on related topics that will help to
   understand the enigmatic behavior of sharks.

   from the skin of brownbanded bamboo shark (Chiloscyllium punctatum) were
   isolated and characterised. The yield of ASC and PSC were 9.38% and 8.86%
   (wet weight basis), respectively. Based on protein patterns and
   TOYOPEARL® CM-650M column chromatography, both collagens contained α- and
   β-chains as their major components. These were characterised as type I
   collagen with the cross-link of α2-chain. As digested by V8-protease and
   lysyl endopeptidase, peptide maps of both ASC and PSC were similar, but
   differed from that of type I collagen from calf skin. Fourier transform
   infrared (FTIR) spectra of both collagens were similar and pepsin
   hydrolysis had no effect on triple-helical structure of collagen.
   Transition temperature (Tmax) of ASC and PSC were 34.45 and 34.52 °C,
   respectively, as determined by differential scanning colorimetry (DSC).
   From zeta potential study, the isoelectric points of ASC and PSC were
   estimated to be 6.21 and 6.56, respectively. Therefore, the skin of
   brownbanded bamboo shark could serve as an alternative source of collagen
   for different applications.

AB Global chondrichthyan (shark, ray, skate and chimaera) landings, reported
   to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), peaked in
   2003 and in the decade since have declined by almost 20%. In the FAO’s
   2012 ‘State of the World’s Fisheries and Aquaculture’ report, the authors
   ‘hoped’ the reductions in landings were partially due to management
   implementation rather than population decline. Here, we tested their
   hypothesis. Post-peak chondrichthyan landings trajectories from 126
   countries were modelled against seven indirect and direct fishing
   pressure measures and eleven measures of fisheries management
   performance, while accounting for ecosystem attributes. We found the
   recent improvement in international or national fisheries management was
   not yet strong enough to account for the recent decline in chondrichthyan
   landings. Instead, the landings declines were more closely related to
   fishing pressure and ecosystem attribute measures. Countries with the
   greatest declines had high human coastal population sizes or high shark
   and ray meat exports such as Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Thailand. While
   important progress had been made, country-level fisheries management
   measures did not yet have the strength or coverage to halt overfishing
   and avert population declines of chondrichthyans. Increased
   implementation of legally binding operational fisheries management and
   species-specific reporting is urgently required to avoid declines and
   ensure fisheries sustainability and food security.

   the southeastern U.S. coast (lat. 22°–35°N, long. 71°–82°W). From 1992 to
   2000, 961 individual longline hauls were observed, during which 4,612
   elasmobranchs (15% of the total catch) were documented. Of the 22
   elasmobranch species observed, silky sharks, Carcharhinus falciformis,
   were numerically dominant (31.4% of the elasmobranch catch). The catch
   status of the animals (alive or dead) when the gear was retrieved varied
   widely depending on the species, with high mortalities seen for the
   commonly caught silky and night, C. signatus, sharks and low mortalities
   for rays (Dasyatidae and Mobulidae), blue, Prionace glauca; and tiger,
   Galeocerdo cuvier; sharks. Discard percentages also varied, ranging from
   low discards (27.6%) for shortfin mako, Isurus oxyrinchus, to high
   discards for blue (99.8%), tiger (98.5%), and rays (100%). Mean fork
   lengths indicated the majority of the observed by-catch — regardless of
   species — was immature, and significant quarterly variation in fork
   length was found for several species including silky; dusky, C. obscurus;
   night; scalloped hammerhead, Sphyrna lewini; oceanic whitetip, C.
   longimanus; and sandbar, C. plumbeus; sharks. While sex ratios overall
   were relatively even, blue, tiger, and scalloped hammerhead shark catches
   were heavily dominated by females. Bootstrap methods were used to
   generate yearly mean catch rates (catch per unit effort) and 95%
   confidence limits; catch rates were generally variable for most species,
   although regression analysis indicated significant trends for night,
   oceanic whitetip, and sandbar sharks. Analysis of variance indicated
   significant catch rate differences among quarters for silky, dusky,

AB Publisher Summary Algal stromatolites are forming today over wide areas
   of the sublittoral platform and adjacent intertidal zone fringing Hamelin
   Pool, a hyperialine barred basin at the southeastern extremity of Shark
   Bay in Western Australia. They are the most diverse and abundant
   shallow-water stromatolites known from modern seas. The fauna of Hamelin
   Pool is very restricted in species diversity because of the hypersaline
   conditions, and algae-consuming organisms are largely absent. As a
   result, algal stromatolites and flat algal-mat sheets flourish on the
   sublittoral and intertidal platforms. Living stromatolites in Hamelin
   Pool extend from depths of at least 3.5 m below sea level to about
   high-water-spring tide level. Older dead stromatolites in varying states
   of disintegration occur above this level, and these have probably emerged
   as a result of Holocene uplift, which may still be continuing. A
   considerable amount of additional work is necessary before the Hamelin
   Pool stromatolites can be fully described and classified. It is desirable
   that a comprehensive system of nomenclature be developed for them, which
   also has applications in the classification of ancient stromatolites.

   Spirochaetes were detected in the smooth mat only, whereas candidate
   division OP11 was only detected in the pustular mat. Targeting
   populations with specific primers revealed additional cyanobacterial
   diversity. The archaeal population of the pustular mat was comprised
   purely of Halobacteriales, whereas the smooth mat contained 16S rDNA
   clones from the Halobacteriales, two groups of Euryarchaea with no close
   characterised matches, and the Thaumarchaea. Nematodes and fungi were
   present in each mat type, with diatom 18S rDNA clones only obtained from
   the smooth mat, and tardigrade and microalgae clones only retrieved from
   the pustular mat. Cultured isolates belonged to the Firmicutes,
   Gammaproteobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria,
   Cyanobacteria, and Halobacteriales. The mat populations were
   significantly more diverse than those previously reported for Hamelin

AB Detailed analysis of microfabrics in Hamelin Pool stromatolites leads to
   reinterpretation of the origins of these structures. Previous studies
   have concluded that Shark Bay stromatolites form primarily as a result of
   sediment trapping and binding by microorganisms. Our results suggest that
   microbial precipitation of microcrystalline carbonate (micrite), as both
   framework and cement in these stromatolites, is also a fundamental,
   heretofore unrecognized, process in their formation. Microbial trapping
   and binding is the primary mechanism of stromatolite accretion in the
   intertidal zone, forming grainy, calcarenite structures. Microbial
   precipitation is the primary accretionary mechanism in the subtidal zone,
   forming muddy, micritic stromatolites. Microbial precipitation also
   lithifies trapped and bound sediment in the calcarenite stromatolites.
   Recognition of microbially precipitated micrite in Shark Bay
   stromatolites is important, as many ancient stromatolites are micritic.

AB The bigeye thresher shark (Alopias superciliosus, Lowe 1841) is one of
   three sharks in the family Alopiidae, which occupy pelagic, neritic, and
   shallow coastal waters throughout the altropics and subtropics (Gruber
   and Compagno, 1981; Castro, 1983). All thresher sharks possess an
   elongated upper caudal lobe, and the bigeye thresher shark is
   distinguished from the other alopiid sharks by its large upward-looking
   eyes and grooves on the top of the head (Bigelow and Schroeder, 1948).
   Our present understanding of the bigeye thresher shark is primarily based
   upon data derived from specimens captured in fisheries, including
   knowledge of its morphological features (Fitch and Craig, 1964; Stillwell
   and Casey, 1976; Thorpe, 1997), geographic range as far as it overlaps

AB This study was carried out to assess mercury levels in fish from

   levels which are also affected by diet, age (associated with length), and
   sex. Total mercury levels were determined in five shark species with
   different habits (Carcharhinus signatus, Mustelus canis, Mustelus
   norrisi, Squalus megalops, and Squalus mitsukurii) which were collected
   during 1997 in southern Brazil's offshore waters. The highest mercury
   concentrations, all above the limit established by Brazilian legislation
   (0.5 μg.g−1), were detected in piscivorous species (C. signatus, S.
   megalops, and S. mitsukurii) with averages of 1.77±0.56, 1.9±0.58, and
   2.22± 0.72 μg.g−1, respectively, while species that feed mainly on
   invertebrates (M. canis and M. norrisi) had averages of 0.41±0.35 and
   0.36±0.28 μg.g−1. These results indicate that feeding habits influence
   total mercury level in sharks. Methylmercury (as a percentage of total
   mercury) determined in S. mitsukurii and M. canis also showed an
   influence of feeding habit. Positive correlations between mercury
   concentration and length were statistically significant (P<0.05) for all
   species, except M. norrisi. Although mercury levels were generally higher
   in males than in females for all species (with the exception of S.
   mitsukurii), a statistically significant correlation was observed only

AB Shark Bay is a large embayment at lat. 25°S on the western coast of
   Australia. Studies of the environment have been carried out in
   conjunction with investigations of carbonate sedimentation and diagenesis
   in the region. In dimension, Shark Bay approaches a small epicontinental
   sea; the area is approximately 5,000 sq mi and average depth is 30 ft.
   The water mass is cut off from the Indian Ocean by a ridge of calcareous
   eolianite and is subdivided internally into numerous inlets, gulfs, and
   basins by dune ridges and submerged banks (sills). Influx of oceanic
   water is only through openings in the northern part of the outer barrier.
   The embayment is adjacent to a low-relief, arid to semi-arid hinterland.
   Runoff influx is negligible and evaporation greatly exceeds
   precipitation. These factors, combined with the hydrologic structure of
   the water mass and restriction imposed by banks and sills, result in
   increasing gradients of salinity into the closed southern parts of the
   embayment. The salinity is from 36 ^pmil in the north to as high as 65
   ^pmil in the south. The water mass has a layered structure with nearly
   vertical attitude. Major clines subdivide the water body into three major
   types: oceanic (36-40 ^pmil), metahaline (40-56 ^pmil), and hypersaline
   (56-70 ^pmil). The water types are limiting on the biota. There are three
   biotic zones, the distribution of which is essentially similar to the
   distribution of water types. Within the broad environmental zones,
   numerous local environments are limited by such factors as wave action,
   tides and tidal currents, and depth. Depth is of major importance because
   most other parameters are linked to it.

AB Sharks are a diverse and ecologically important group, including some of
   the ocean’s largest predatory animals. Sharks are also commercially
   important, with many species suffering overexploitation and facing
   extinction. However, despite a long evolutionary history, commercial, and
   conservation importance, phylogenetic relationships within the sharks are
   poorly understood. To date, most studies have either focused on smaller
   clades within sharks, or sampled taxa sparsely across the group. A more
   detailed species-level phylogeny will offer further insights into shark
   taxonomy, provide a tool for comparative analyses, as well as
   facilitating phylogenetic estimates of conservation priorities. We used
   four mitochondrial and one nuclear gene to investigate the phylogenetic
   relationships of 229 species (all eight Orders and 31 families) of
   sharks, more than quadrupling the number of taxon sampled in any prior
   study. The resulting Bayesian phylogenetic hypothesis agrees with prior
   studies on the major relationships of the sharks phylogeny; however, on
   those relationships that have proven more controversial, it differs in
   several aspects from the most recent molecular studies. The phylogeny
   supports the division of sharks into two major groups, the Galeomorphii
   and Squalimorphii, rejecting the hypnosqualean hypothesis that places
   batoids within sharks. Within the squalimorphs the orders Hexanchiformes,
   Squatiniformes, Squaliformes, and Pristiophoriformes are broadly
   monophyletic, with minor exceptions apparently due to missing data.
   Similarly, within Galeomorphs, the orders Heterodontiformes, Lamniformes,
   Carcharhiniformes, and Orectolobiformes are broadly monophyletic, with a
   couple of species ‘misplaced’. In contrast, many of the currently
   recognized shark families are not monophyletic according to our results.
   Our phylogeny offers some of the first clarification of the relationships
   among families of the order Squaliformes, a group that has thus far
   received relatively little phylogenetic attention. Our results suggest
   that the genus Echinorhinus is not a squaliform, but rather related to
   the saw sharks, a hypothesis that might be supported by both groups
   sharing ‘spiny’ snouts. In sum, our results offer the most detailed
   species-level phylogeny of sharks to date and a tool for comparative
   analyses.

AB New analysis of an Acanthodes braincase forces a reappraisal of the
   phylogeny of gnathosomes, suggesting that the vertebrate head underwent
   reorganization not only before the emergence of jaws, but also
   afterwards. The acanthodians, a long-extinct group of fish that thrived
   during the Palaeozoic era, more than 420 million years ago, are central
   to our understanding of the origin of modern gnathostomes, the jawed
   vertebrates. Most acanthodians are known from little more than scales and
   fin spines. The one example known in detail, Acanthodes, has long been
   understood to be anatomically close to bony fishes; however, this new
   analysis of an Acanthodes braincase aligns it with sharks rather than
   with bony fish. This forces a reappraisal of the phylogeny of
   gnathostomes, implying that that the vertebrate head underwent
   reorganization not only before the emergence of jaws, but also
   afterwards. Acanthodians, an exclusively Palaeozoic group of fish, are
   central to a renewed debate on the origin of modern gnathostomes: jawed
   vertebrates comprising Chondrichthyes (sharks, rays and ratfish) and
   Osteichthyes (bony fishes and tetrapods)1,2,3,4,5,6. Acanthodian internal
   anatomy is primarily understood from Acanthodes bronni2,7,8,9,10 because
   it remains the only example preserved in substantial detail, central to
   which is an ostensibly osteichthyan braincase1,2,7. For this reason,
   Acanthodes has become an indispensible component in early gnathostome
   phylogenies1,11,12,13,14,15,16,17. Here we present a new description of
   the Acanthodes braincase, yielding new details of external and internal
   morphology, notably the regions surrounding and within the ear capsule
   and neurocranial roof. These data contribute to a new reconstruction
   that, unexpectedly, resembles early chondrichthyan crania. Principal
   coordinates analysis of a character–taxon matrix including these new data
   confirms this impression: Acanthodes is quantifiably closer to
   chondrichthyans than to osteichthyans. However, phylogenetic analysis
   places Acanthodes on the osteichthyan stem, as part of a well-resolved
   tree that also recovers acanthodians as stem chondrichthyans and stem
   gnathostomes. As such, perceived chondrichthyan features of the
   Acanthodes cranium represent shared primitive conditions for crown group
   gnathostomes. Moreover, this increasingly detailed picture of early
   gnathostome evolution highlights ongoing and profound anatomical
   reorganization of vertebrate crania after the origin of jaws but before
   the divergence of living clades.

AB In many fisheries, some component of the catch is usually released.
   Quantifying the effects of capture and release on fish survival is
   critical for determining which practices are sus- tainable, particularly
   for threatened species. Using a standardized fishing technique, we
   studied sublethal (blood physiology and reflex impairment assessment) and
   lethal (post-release mortality with satellite tags) outcomes of fishing
   stress on 5 species of coastal sharks (great hammerhead, bull, blacktip,
   lemon, and tiger). Species-specific differences were detected in whole
   blood lactate, partial pressure of carbon dioxide, and pH values, with
   lactate emerging as the sole parameter to be significantly affected by
   increasing hooking duration and shark size. Species-spe- cific
   differences in reflex impairment were also found; however, we did not
   detect any significant relationships between reflex impairment and
   hooking duration. Taken together, we ranked each species according to
   degree of stress response, from most to least disturbed, as follows:
   hammer- head shark > blacktip shark > bull shark > lemon shark > tiger
   shark. Satellite tagging data revealed that nearly 100% of all tracked
   tiger sharks reported for at least 4 wk after release, which was
   significantly higher than bull (74.1%) and great hammerhead (53.6%)
   sharks. We discuss which mechanisms may lead to species-specific
   differences in sensitivity to fishing and suggest that observed variation
   in responses may be influenced by ecological and evolutionary phenom-
   ena. Moreover, our results show that certain species (i.e. hammerhead
   sharks in this study) are inherently vulnerable to capture stress and
   mortality resulting from fisheries interactions and should receive
   additional attention in future conservation strategies.

AB Three-dimensional static equilibrium analysis of the forces generated by
   the jaw musculature of the horn shark Heterodontus francisci was used to
   theoretically estimate the maximum force distributions and loadings on
   its jaws and suspensorium during biting. Theoretical maximum bite force
   was then compared with bite forces measured (1) voluntarily in situ , (2)
   in restrained animals and (3) during electrical stimulation of the jaw
   adductor musculature of anesthetized sharks. Maximum theoretical bite
   force ranged from 128 N at the anteriormost cuspidate teeth to 338 N at
   the posteriormost molariform teeth. The hyomandibula, which connects the
   posterior margin of the jaws to the base of the chondrocranium, is loaded
   in tension during biting. Conversely, the ethmoidal articulation between
   the palatal region of the upper jaw and the chondrocranium is loaded in
   compression, even during upper jaw protrusion, because H. francisci 's
   upper jaw does not disarticulate from the chondrocranium during prey
   capture. Maximum in situ bite force averaged 95 N for free-swimming H.
   francisci , with a maximum of 133 N. Time to maximum force averaged 322
   ms and was significantly longer than time away from maximum force (212
   ms). Bite force measurements from restrained individuals (187 N) were
   significantly greater than those from free-swimming individuals (95 N)
   but were equivalent to those from both theoretical (128 N) and
   electrically stimulated measurements (132 N). The mean mass-specific bite
   of H. francisci was greater than that of many other vertebrates and
   second highest of the cartilaginous fishes that have been studied.
   Measuring bite force on restrained sharks appears to be the best
   indicator of maximum bite force. The large bite forces and robust
   molariform dentition of H. francisci correspond to its consumption of
   hard prey.

AB 1. Over the past two decades the number of fisheries targeting shark
   resources has increased dramatically. A combination of factors, including
   relatively slow growth rate, low fecundity and late age of maturity,
   result in low recovery rates from exploitation for most shark species.
   This, in turn, is reflected in the poor record of sustainability of shark
   fisheries. 2. One of the greatest challenges is to find a way to deal
   with the substantial levels of shark bycatch taken in many non-target
   fisheries. Poor general recording of shark landings and paucity of shark
   landing data at the species level also undermine the development of
   effective shark management strategies. 3. This paper reviews the problems
   that must be faced worldwide if shark resources are to be managed
   sustainably and lays out a comprehensive set of prioritized management
   strategies to facilitate the sustainable management of global shark
   fisheries. It is acknowledged that the majority of sharks are harvested
   in developing countries and that the management of shark resources in
   developing and developed countries will need to incorporate different
   management strategies relevant to local socio-economic agendas. The
   management recommendations deal with methods to improve the global
   regulation of fisheries, ways to improve global conservation ethics and
   encourage active participation in management, as well as means by which
   specific management strategies may be implemented. Copyright

AB Integral geoacoustic properties of the sea bottom were determined from
   full-field inversion of broad-band, water-borne, acoustic propagation
   data. The data were obtained during the YELLOW SHARK 94 experiment along
   a 15-km mildly range-dependent transect at a shallow water site in the
   western Mediterranean. Seven tones from 200 Hz to 800 Hz were transmitted
   simultaneously by a mid-depth acoustic projector, bottom-moored at
   different ranges from a vertical array that spanned the water column
   below the thermocline. Extensive oceanographic and geophysical
   information were obtained in situ to support and validate the inversion.
   Matched-field processing was applied to the received pressure fields for
   each tone frequency. Optimization of the environmental parameters was
   performed simultaneously across all propagated frequencies. A
   maximum-likelihood objective function included the linear (Bartlett)
   cross correlator at the individual frequencies. Genetic algorithms
   searched for the global minimum of this objective function. The
   convergence and accuracy of the inversion were determined from
   statistical analysis of the a posteriori distribution of the candidate
   environmental models produced by the search algorithm. The following
   conclusions were drawn from this study. 1) For a fixed source-vertical
   array configuration broad-band tomographic measurements were a sine qua
   non to obtain meaningful inversion results. 2) The broad-band inversion
   provided considerable stability and robustness with respect to volume and
   bottom variabilities. 3) Corresponding single-frequency inversions
   performed under the exact same conditions produced erratic results. 4)
   Integral geoacoustic properties of the bottom were effectively determined
   within the constraints imposed by the bottom parameterization. 5) More
   detailed and accurate properties were obtained by including the range
   dependence of ocean sound-speed profile in the forward modeling. 6) The
   broad-band-inverted sound-speed profile, attenuation, density, and
   thickness of the top clay layer, and sound speed of the underlying silt
   layer, were in close agreement with the independent geophysical
   measurements.

AB Over 100 million sharks are killed annually, putting enormous pressure on
   sharkpopulations worldwide. Sharks have traditionally been considered a
   detriment tocoastal tourism, but since the early 1990s, shifts in
   attitudes amongst divers haveled to growth in the popularity of shark
   watching as a tourist activity. An estimated500,000 divers a year ﬁnd,
   photograph, feed, and swim with sharks, contributingmillions of dollars
   to local and regional economies. This paper examines whetherthe economic
   value attached to shark watching can provide enough incentive toreduce
   consumptive exploitation levels. Although the economic value attached
   toshark watching has led to greater protection of sharks in some
   locations, analysisof available data suggests that incentives do not
   appear large enough to encouragea signiﬁcant reduction in ﬁshing pressure
   appropriate to the scale of threat facingsharks. Growth of the shark
   watching industry is constrained by a number offactors including
   perceived risks and beneﬁts, declining shark populations, and gov-ernment
   regulations. However, conservation strategies for sharks involving
   tourismcan be envisaged, involving varying levels of non-consumptive and
   consumptiveuses of sharks. Three kinds of interaction between the
   non-consumptive and con-sumptive use of sharks are outlined along with

AB Shark predation may have been a central factor influencing the evolution
   of sociality in dolphins, as well as a determinant of dolphin habitat use
   and behavior. To understand the role of predation in driving
   interpopulation differences in behavior and sociality, it is important to
   quantify differences in predation risk among populations. This study
   describes the frequency of shark-inflicted scars and estimates the shark
   attack rate on bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops aduncus) in Shark Bay,
   Western Australia. Shark bite scars were found on 74.2% (95 of 128) of
   non-calves, and most of these scars were inflicted by tiger sharks
   (Galeocerdo cuvier). Although there were no differences among age/sex
   classes in the frequency of scarring, significantly more adult males than
   adult females bore multiple scars. The rate of unsuccessful shark attack
   was estimated to be between 11% and 13% of dolphins attacked each year.
   Large sharks (>3 m) were responsible for a disproportionate number of
   attacks. However, bites from small carcharhinid sharks on 6.2% of
   dolphins suggest that some of these small sharks may be dolphin
   ectoparasites. Both the scar frequencies and attack rate suggest that
   Shark Bay dolphins face a greater risk of predation than bottlenose
   dolphins in other locations.

AB In the male part of the ductus deferens is an ampulla nearly two metres
   in length, containing numerous transverse septa each with a central

   spermatophores up to about 3 cm. in diameter, each with a core of sperm
   and a firm translucent cortex. They float in a clear fluid, and about
   four gallons of them are transferred to the female. In the female the
   right ovary alone is functional; it contains at least six million ova 0.5
   mm. or more in diameter, most of which degenerate and are replaced by
   bodies resembling corpora lutea. The yolky eggs must be ripe at a
   diameter of about 5 mm., for the diameter of the anterior end of the
   oviduct, which has inelastic fibrous walls, is too narrow for anything
   larger to pass. The uterus, about 1 m. in length, is lined throughout its
   greater part with trophonemata up to 1 $\ cdot $ 0 cm. long. The
   structure of the ovary would suggest that Cetorhinus is oviparous, but
   that of the uterus clearly shows that it is viviparous (or
   ovo-viviparous). There are no modern records of pregnancies, although the
   sex ratio in the commercial catch is thirty or forty females to one male.
   Sexual maturity is not reached until at least the third year of age.
   Females are impregnated in surface inshore waters during early summer,
   but pregnant females evidently migrate elsewhere, either horizontally or
   vertically or both, and do not reappear until after parturition.

   have utilized tagging data (Bonham et al ., 1949; Holden, 1972); size

   (Moss, 1967, 1972) and vertebral rings. These rings on the vertebral
   centra, resulting from variations in calcification, have also been used
   in the age determination of teleosts. In the scombroids there is often
   considerable variation in results even between authors working on the
   same species, mainly due to difficulty in interpreting the rings and
   deciding whether they are true year marks (Aikawa & Kato, 1938; Partlo,

AB Abstract The rearrangement of antibody and T-cell receptor gene segments
   is indispensable to the vertebrate immune response. All extant jawed
   vertebrates can rearrange these gene segments. This ability is conferred
   by the recombination activating genes I and II (RAG I and RAG II). To
   elucidate their origin and function, the cDNA encoding RAG I from a
   member of the most ancient class of extant gnathostomes, the Carcharhine
   sharks, was characterized. Homology domains identified within shark RAG I
   prompted sequence comparison analyses that suggested similarity of the
   RAG I and II genes, respectively, to the integrase family genes and
   integration host factor genes of the bacterial site-specific
   recombination system. Thus, the apparent explosive evolution (or "big
   bang") of the ancestral immune system may have been initiated by a
   transfer of microbial site-specific recombinases.

AB : DNA microsatellite markers were used to characterize the population
   genetic structure of the lemon shark, Negaprion brevirostris, in the
   western Atlantic. This study demonstrates for the first time the
   usefulness of microsatellites to study population genetic structure and
   mating systems in the Chondricthyes. Lemon sharks (mostly juveniles) were
   sampled non-destructively from four locations, Gullivan Bay and Marquesas
   Key in Florida, Bimini, Bahamas, and Atol das Rocas, Brazil. At least 545
   individuals were genotyped at each of four dinucleotide loci. The number
   of alleles per locus ranged from 19 to 43, and expected heterozygosities
   ranged from 0.69 to 0.90. Relatively little genetic structure was found
   in the western Atlantic, with small but significant values for estimators
   of F(ST) and R(ST) among populations, theta (0.016) and rho (0.026),
   respectively. No sharp discontinuities were found between the Caribbean
   sites and Brazil, and most alleles were found at all four sites,
   indicating that gene flow occurs throughout the western Atlantic with no
   evidence for distinct stocks.

AB The Ig new antigen receptors (IgNARs) are single-domain antibodies found
   in the serum of sharks. Here, we report 2.2- and 2.8-A structures of the
   type 2 IgNAR variable domains 12Y-1 and 12Y-2. Structural features
   include, first, an Ig superfamily topology transitional between cell
   adhesion molecules, antibodies, and T cell receptors; and, second, a
   vestigial complementarity-determining region 2 at the “bottom” of the
   molecule, apparently discontinuous from the antigen-binding paratope and
   similar to that observed in cell adhesion molecules. Thus, we suggest
   that IgNARs originated as cell-surface adhesion molecules coopted to the
   immune repertoire and represent an evolutionary lineage independent of
   variable heavy chain/variable light chain type antibodies. Additionally,
   both 12Y-1 and 12Y-2 form unique crystallographic dimers, predominantly
   mediated by main-chain framework interactions, which represent a possible
   model for primordial cell-based interactions. Unusually, the 12Y-2
   complementarity-determining region 3 also adopts an extended β-hairpin
   structure, suggesting a distinct selective advantage in accessing cryptic
   antigenic epitopes.

AB A 4.9 m TL megamouth shark, only the sixth specimen known to science, was
   tracked continuously for 50.5 h, during which it exhibited distinct
   vertical migrations at the dawn and dusk transitions. The male shark was
   captured on 21 October 1990 in a drift gill net off Dana Point,
   California, restrained overnight in a harbor, and released at sea the
   next afternoon. Horizontally, the shark moved slowly southward, covering
   62 km on a relatively straight path with no significant diel changes. For
   the major part of the tracking, its rate of movement was 1.15 km h−1, as
   determined from positions at 15 min intervals. Considering a probable
   head current of 10–25 cm sec−1, its estimated through-the-water swimming
   speed was more likely 1.5–2.1 km h−1 (X¯ = 1.8, representing 0.1 body
   lengths sec−1). Vertically, the shark stayed shallow at night (12–25 m
   depth range, X¯ = 17) and deep during the days (120–166 m, X¯ = 149) but
   still well above the bottom at 700–850 m. The four twilight depth-change
   events were very distinct and always spanned the times of sunset or
   sunrise. The ascent and descent profiles are a reasonble match to
   isolumes on the order of 0.4 lux for an extinction coefficient (0.07)
   calculated from water transparency measurements. Furthermore, the
   steepest parts of the shark's profiles correspond closely to the times of
   maximum rate-of-change of illumination. These findings suggest that,
   except during nights, the shark's chosen depth was to a large degree
   determined by light level.

AB The pattern of somatic mutations of shark and frog Ig is distinct from
   somatic hypermutation of Ig in mammals in that there is a bias to mutate
   GC base pairs and a low frequency of mutations. Previous analysis of the
   new antigen receptor gene in nurse sharks (NAR), however, revealed no
   bias to mutate GC base pairs and the frequency of mutation was comparable
   to that of mammalian IgG. Here, we analyzed 1023 mutations in NAR and
   found no targeting of the mechanism to any particular nucleotide but did
   obtain strong evidence for a transition bias and for strand polarity. As
   seen for all species studied to date, the serine codon AGC/T in NAR was a
   mutational hotspot. The NAR mutational pattern is most similar to that of
   mammalian IgG and furthermore both are strikingly akin to mutations
   acquired during the neutral evolution of nuclear pseudogenes, suggesting
   that a similar mechanism is at work for both processes. In yeast, most
   spontaneous mutations are introduced by the translesion synthesis DNA
   polymerase z (REV3) and in various DNA repair-deficient backgrounds
   transitions were more often REV3-dependent than were transversions.
   Therefore, we propose a model of somatic hypermutation where DNA
   polymerase z is recruited to the Ig locus. An excess of DNA glycosylases
   in germinal center reactions may further enhance the mutation frequency
   by a REV3-dependent mutagenic process known as imbalanced base excision
   repair.

AB Strip-transect aerial surveys of Shark Bay, Ningaloo Reef and Exmouth
   Gulf were conducted during the winters of 1989 and 1994. These surveys
   were designed primarily to estimate the abundance and distribution of
   dugongs, although they also allowed sea turtles and dolphins, and, to a
   lesser extent, whales, manta rays and whale sharks to be surveyed. Shark
   Bay contains a large population of dugongs that is of international
   significance. Estimates of approximately 10000 dugongs resulted from both
   surveys. The density of dugongs is the highest recorded in Australia and
   the Middle East, where these surveys have been conducted. Exmouth Gulf
   and Ningaloo Reef are also important dugong habitats, each supporting in
   the order of 1000 dugongs. The estimated number of turtles in Shark Bay
   is comparable to the number in Exmouth Gulf plus Ningaloo Reef
   (7000–9000). The density of turtles in Ningaloo Reef and, to a lesser
   extent, Exmouth Gulf is exceptionally high compared with most other areas
   that have been surveyed by the same technique. Shark Bay supports a
   substantial population of bottlenose dolphins (2000–3000 minimum
   estimate). Exmouth Gulf and Ningaloo Reef were not significant habitats
   for dolphins during the winter surveys. Substantial numbers of whales
   (primarily humpbacks) and manta rays occur in northern and western Shark
   Bay in winter. Ningaloo Reef is an important area for whale sharks and
   manta rays in autumn and winter. The Shark Bay Marine Park excludes much
   of the winter habitats of the large vertebrate fauna of Shark Bay. In
   1989 and 1994, more than half of all the dugongs were seen outside the
   Marine Park (57·4 and 50·7%, respectively). Approximately one-third to
   one-half of turtles and dolphins were seen outside the Marine Park (in
   1989 and 1994 respectively: turtles, 43 and 27%; dolphins, 47 and 32%).
   Almost all the whales and most of the manta rays were seen outside the
   Marine Park. Expansion of the Shark Bay Marine Park, to bring it into
   alignment with the marine section of the Shark Bay World Heritage Area,
   would facilitate the appropriate management of these populations. This
   would also simplify the State– Commonwealth collaboration necessary to
   meet the obligations of World Heritage listing. The coastal waters of
   Western Australia north of the surveyed area (over 6000 km of coastline)
   are relatively poorly known and surveys of their marine megafauna are
   required for wise planning and management.

AB The school shark (Galeorhinus galeus) resource off southern Australia is
   assessed by use of an assessment approach that takes account of the
   spatial structure of the population. The population dynamics model
   underlying the assessment considers the spatial as well as the
   age-specific characteristics of school shark. It allows for a series of
   fisheries (each based on a different gear type), explicitly models the
   pupping/recruitment process, and allows for multiple stocks. The values
   for the parameters of this model are determined by fitting it to
   catch-rate data and information from tagging studies. The point estimates
   of the pup production at the start of 1997 range from 12% to 18% of the
   pre-exploitation equilibrium size, depending on the specifications of the
   assessment. Allowing for spatial structure and incorporating tag
   release–recapture data lead to reduced uncertainty compared with earlier
   assessments. The status of the resource, as reflected by the ratio of
   present to virgin pup production and total (1+) biomass, is sensitive to
   the assumed level of movement between the stocks in New Zealand and those
   in Australia, with lower values corresponding to higher levels of
   movement.

   compared with one another and with other chordate Hox clusters. The
   results show that one of the horn shark clusters (HoxM) is orthologous to
   the mammalian HoxA cluster and shows a structural similarity to the
   amphioxus cluster, whereas the other shark cluster (HoxN) is orthologous
   to the mammalian HoxD cluster based on cluster organization and a
   comparison with noncoding and Hox gene-coding sequences. The persistence
   of an identifiable HoxA cluster over an 800-million-year divergence time
   demonstrates that the Hox gene clusters are highly integrated and

AB Large, solitary, marine predators such as sharks have been observed to
   aggregate at specific areas. Such aggregations are almost certainly
   driven by foraging and behavioural strategies making space for diverse
   spatial organizations. Reef-associated shark species often show strong
   patterns of site fidelity that could be viewed as a prerequisite for
   sociality. However, there is limited empirical evidence that such
   aggregations are driven by intrinsic social factors. Association data for
   blacktip reef sharks, Carcharhinus melanopterus, were obtained from
   photoidentification surveys conducted in Moorea coral reefs (French
   Polynesia). We adapted a social network approach to demonstrate evidence
   of four main communities and two subcommunities within the population. We
   confronted the resulting structure with candidate explanatory variables.
   Sharks formed spatial groups characterized by nonrandom and long-term
   associations, despite opportunities for social relationships to develop
   between communities. Sex and length of sharks tended to influence
   assortment at the population and community levels. Individual space use
   also explained community structure, although spatial assortment was
   globally weaker than random expectations, suggesting that observed
   associations were not an artefact of the sampling design or spatial
   distribution of individuals. We conclude that the observed grouping
   patterns not only resulted from passive aggregations for specific
   resources, but rather the communities developed from an active choice of
   individuals as a sign of sociability. Individual preferences and
   adaptation to local conditions, as well as demographic, ecological and
   anthropogenic factors, may explain the social variability between
   communities. This suggests that a stable grouping strategy may confer
   substantial benefits in this marine predator.

AB Movement patterns of scalloped hammerhead sharks in the vicinity of El
   Bajo Espiritu Santo, a seamount in the Gulf of California, were
   determined by tracking by ultrasonic telemetry 13 sharks and marking 100
   sharks. The 13 tracked sharks swam back and forth along the seamount
   ridge throughout the day. They did not swim in different directions to
   reduce swimming effort when currents changed from a parallel to a
   perpendicular orientation to the ridge. Sharks tracked up to 8 km away
   into the pelagic environment soon returned to the seamount. From such
   trackings and repeated observations of marked sharks over periods of
   several weeks, it is believed that most sharks disperse and return to the
   seamount in a rhythmical fashion. The separate departures of individual
   hammerheads in five paired trackings indicated that the sharks left the
   seamount either in small groups or singly. For these reasons, we argue
   that the social system of the scalloped hammerhead shark can be described
   as a refuging system.

AB Secondary lymphoid tissue and immunoglobulin (Ig) production in mammals
   is not fully developed at birth, requiring time postnatally to attain all

   newborn sharks – the oldest vertebrate group having adaptive immunity –
   also displays immature characteristics such as low serum IgM
   concentration and high levels of IgM1gj, an innate-like Ig. Primary and
   secondary lymphoid tissues in sharks and other cartilaginous fish were
   identified previously, but their cellular organization was not examined
   in detail. In this study of nurse shark lymphoid tissue, we demonstrate
   that the adult spleen contains well-defined, highly vascularized white
   pulp (WP) areas, composed of a central T-cell zone containing a major
   histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II+ dendritic cell (DC) network
   and a small number of Ig+ secretory cells, surrounded by smaller zones of
   surface Ig+ (sIg+) B cells. In neonates, splenic WPs are exclusively
   B-cell zones containing sIgM+–MHC class IIlow B cells; thus
   compartmentalized areas with T cells and DCs, as well as surface Ig novel
   antigen receptor (sIgNAR)-expressing B cells are absent at birth. Not
   until the pups are 5 months old do these WP areas become adult-like;
   concomitantly, sIgNAR+ B cells are readily detectable, indicating that
   this Ig class requires a ‘mature immune-responsive environment’. The
   epigonal organ is the major site of neonatal B lymphopoiesis, based on
   the presence of developing B cells and recombination-activating gene 1
   (RAG1)/terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) expression, indicative
   of antigen receptor rearrangement; such expression persists into adult
   life, whereas the spleen has negligible lymphopoietic activity. In adults
   but not neonates, many secretory B cells reside in the epigonal organ,
   suggesting, like in mammals, that B cells home to this primary lymphoid
   tissue after activation in other areas of the body.

AB Algal mats and algal-laminated sediments are present in the protected
   intertidal environment of the Gladstone embayment, a small reentrant on
   the east coast of Shark Bay, Western Australia. Three morphologic types
   of algal mats are recognizable--tufted, convoluted, and smooth. Thick
   sequences of flat-laminated sediments are formed beneath smooth algal
   mats, whereas sediments below other mat types are poorly laminated or
   unlaminated. Algal-laminated sediments are composed of mechanically
   deposited particles of clastic origin which have been bound by a film of
   filamentous and unicellular algae. The algal-laminated sediments in the
   Gladstone embayment are essentially flat-laminated; they lack the regular
   development of large-scale structures which characterize algal
   stromatolites as defined by Logan. Flat algal-laminated sediments develop
   several small-scale structural and textural features which form during or
   after deposition. Primary (depositional) features include algal-filament
   molds, graded bedding, cyclic bedding, and storm deposits. Secondary
   (postdepositional) features include structures formed by gas movement and
   accumulation, desiccation, and organisms. Indurated sediments associated
   with algal-laminated sediments are classified as crusts and wall rock.
   Both indurated sediment types are characterized by aragonitic mineralogy,
   pelletal textures, and fenestral fabrics. Crusts in the form of pavements
   and "flat-pebble conglomerates" occur in the inner areas of the
   intertidal zone and in the supratidal zone, whereas wall rock forms
   "spur-and-groove" structures in the intertidal zone. Criteria for the
   recognition of algal-laminated sediments are the combination of clastic
   texture, the presence of steeply inclined, vertical or overfolded
   laminae, algal-filament molds, and association with sediments with
   pelletal textures and fenestral fabrics. An important environmental
   factor in the development of algal mats and laminated sediments in the
   Gladstone embayment and the southern basins of Shark Bay is the high
   salinity of the basinal waters. Salinity of water in these areas ranges
   between 55 and 65 ^pmil in summer. The significance of algae as
   mat-forming and sediment-binding organisms in intertidal environments
   decreases toward the more open, northern waters of Shark Bay where
   salinity is lower.

   aim of using the IUCN Red List Categories and Criteria to assess the
   conservation status of pelagic sharks and rays. This report provides a
   detailed summary of the IUCN Red List assessment for these species,
   highlighting species of conservation concern as well as identifying
   species assessed as Least Concern and Data Deficient. This report is
   intended to inform the development of research, conservation and
   management priorities for this group of species.

AB The demand for shark fins is arguably the most important determinant of
   the fate of shark populations around the world. This paper examines the
   role that social and economic factors in China play in driving the trade
   both historically and under current trends of economic growth. The use of
   shark fin as a traditional and socially important luxury food item, along
   with rapidly expanding consumer purchasing power is expected to place
   increasing pressure on available resources. At the same time, the
   migration of the trade from its former center in Hong Kong to Mainland
   China has resulted in a severe curtailment of the ability to monitor and
   assess impacts on shark populations. Although recent international policy
   responses to this issue have resulted in the implementation of shark
   finning bans in some areas, these measures are likely to encourage full
   use of dead sharks; i.e. discourage carcass discards, as called for under
   the FAO International Plan of Action-Sharks, but not reduce shark
   mortality.

AB Although the whale shark Rhincodon typus is the largest extant fish, it
   was not described until 1828 and by 1986 there were only 320 records of
   this species. Since then, growth in tourism and marine recreation
   globally has lead to a significant increase in the number of sightings
   and several areas with annual occurrences have been identified, spurring
   a surge of research on the species. Simultaneously, there was a great
   expansion in targeted R. typus fisheries to supply the Asian restaurant
   trade, as well as a largely un-quantified by-catch of the species in
   purse-seine tuna fisheries. Currently R. typus is listed by the IUCN as
   vulnerable, due mainly to the effects of targeted fishing in two areas.
   Photo-identification has shown that R. typus form seasonal size and sex
   segregated feeding aggregations and that a large proportion of fish in
   these aggregations are philopatric in the broadest sense, tending to
   return to, or remain near, a particular site. Somewhat conversely,
   satellite tracking studies have shown that fish from these aggregations
   can migrate at ocean-basin scales and genetic studies have, to date,
   found little graphic differentiation globally. Conservation approaches
   are now informed by observational and environmental studies that have
   provided insight into the feeding habits of the species and its preferred
   habitats. Notwithstanding these advances, there remain notable gaps in
   the knowledge of this species particularly with respect to the life
   history of neonates and adults who are not found in the feeding
   aggregations.

AB Wedge-shaped bodies of calcrete-ooid grainstone, calcrete-pisolite
   grainstone, and lithoclast breccia occur in the Edel province, Shark Bay,
   Western Australia. These deposits are soils formed on the eolianite
   (skeletal grainstone) country rocks (Pleistocene, Tamala Eolianite).
   Calcrete ooids are round sand-size particles (commonly 1-5 cm in
   diameter) consisting of a thin envelope of calcrete around a skeletal
   grain or lithoclast nucleus; calcrete pisolites are gravel-size particles
   (commonly 1-5 cm in diameter) consisting of an envelope of laminated
   calcrete around an eolianite lithoclast nucleus; lithoclasts in the
   breccias are angular fragments 5-15 cm or more) of calcretized eolianite
   which are commonly coated with a thin envelope of calcrete. Fully
   developed weathering profiles contain, in descending order, (5) pisolitic
   soil horizon; (4) laminar-calcrete zone, composed of thinly laminated
   sheets of calcrete; (3) massive-calcrete zone, composed of dense,
   structureless "lime mudstone" in which calcrete fills voids and replaces
   carbonate grains to form secondary "mud-support" fabrics; (2) mottled
   zone, consisting of eolian skeletal grainstone containing scattered
   mottles of structureless calcrete; and (1) unaltered eolian skeletal
   grainstone. The geometry of soil bodies and distribution of lithofacies
   are influenced by topography and differential rates of movement of soil
   particles in downslope transport. Soils are thickest on the lower flanks
   of ridges and thin toward crests and into interdune depressions.
   Lithofacies are distributed in broad concentric zones about "highs."
   Breccias occur adjacent to ridges where slopes are steep; they grade
   outward into pisolite grainstones and then into calcrete-ooid grainstones
   as slopes decrease away from ridges. Interdune depressions were flooded
   during three marine phases in the Quaternary, and sea level reached
   approximately similar positions at the limit of each transgression.
   During marine phases, indurated limestones at the shore were beveled by
   marine erosion to form tidal terraces and seacliffs; locally, these
   limestones were overlain by marine sediments. During regressive phases,
   marine units in coastal areas were covered by soils shed from nearby
   highs. Transported soils also buried coastal landforms cut during marine
   phases. Stratigraphic relations between marine units and soils are
   extremely varied, having been influenced by topographic factors, energy
   conditions, lithification and erodability of sediments in coastal areas,
   and multiple transgression and regression. Contacts between soils and
   marine units are of several basic types: (1) surfaces of marine erosion,
   (2) nonerosional contacts, (3) irregular surfaces of weathering and
   subaerial erosion, and (4) gradational contacts formed by admixing of
   soils and marine shells in transitional marine-terrestrial environments,
   by infiltration, and by marine reworking of soils.

AB Because sharks possess an unusual suite of reproductive characteristics,
   including internal fertilization, sperm storage, relatively low
   fecundity, and reproductive modes that range from oviparity to
   viviparity, they can provide important insight into the evolution of
   mating systems and sexual selection. Yet, to date, few studies have
   characterized behavioral and genetic mating systems in natural
   populations of sharks or other elasmobranchs. In this study, highly
   polymorphic microsatellite loci were used to examine breeding biology of
   a large coastal shark, the lemon shark, Negaprion brevirostris, at a
   tropical lagoon nursery. Over six years, 910 lemon sharks were sampled
   and genotyped. Young were assigned into sibling groups that were then
   used to reconstruct genotypes of unsampled adults. We assigned 707 of 735
   young sharks to one of 45 female genotypes (96.2%), and 485 (66.0%) were
   assigned to a male genotype. Adult female sharks consistently returned to
   Bimini on a biennial cycle to give birth. Over 86% of litters had
   multiple sires. Such high levels of polyandry raise the possibility that
   polyandry evolved in viviparous sharks to reduce genetic
   incompatibilities between mother and embryos. We did not find a
   relationship between relatedness of mates and the number of offspring
   produced, indicating that inbreeding avoidance was probably not driving
   pre- or postcopulatory mate choice. Adult male sharks rarely sired more
   than one litter at Bimini and may mate over a broader geographic area.

AB 1. The decline of large-bodied predatory species in the oceans is a
   concern both from a sustainability perspective and because such species
   can have important ecological roles. Sharks are particularly vulnerable
   to fishing as their life histories are characterized by late age at
   maturity, large body size, and low fecundity. 2. Substantial shark
   population declines have been documented for a number of coastal and
   pelagic systems, with high population abundance limited to a few remote
   locations. The relative abundance and composition of reef shark
   populations are assessed from 1975 to 2006 at a remote, largely
   uninhabited, group of atolls in the central Indian Ocean; the Chagos
   Archipelago. 3. Number of sharks observed per scientific dive declined
   from a mean of 4.2 in the 1970s to 0.4 in 2006, representing a decline of
   over 90%. Silvertip sharks displayed an increase in abundance from 1996,
   whereas blacktip and whitetip reef sharks were rarely encountered in
   2006. 4. Poaching in the archipelago, is the most likely cause of these
   declines, highlighted by a number of illegal vessels containing large
   numbers of sharks arrested since 1996. The data highlight that shark
   populations, even in remote, otherwise pristine, marine areas, are
   vulnerable to distant fishing fleets, and a range of strategies will need
   to be used in concert for their conservation. Copyright (C) 2010 John

   novel ACE inhibitory peptides, with IC 50 values of 1.96, 2.68 and 1.45

   using the distilled water at different temperatures (45, 60 and 75 °C)
   and times (6 and 12 h). Yields of gelatin from the skins of BBS and BTS
   were 19.06–22.81% and 21.17–24.76% (based on wet weight), respectively.
   Gelatins from both species extracted at 45 °C for 6 h exhibited the
   highest bloom strength (206–214 g), which was higher than that of
   commercial bovine bone gelatin (197 g) (p < 0.05). Gelatin gels from BBS
   skin could set at room temperature (25–26 °C) within 24 min. However,
   gelatin gels from BTS skin was not able to set within 3 h at the same
   temperature. Scanning electron microscopic study showed that gelatin gel
   from BBS skin presented the thicker strand than those from BTS skin and
   bovine bone. Cross-linked components (β- and γ-chains) and α-chains were
   more degraded with increasing extraction temperatures, especially at 75
   °C. Gelatin from BTS skin was more susceptible to hydrolysis than that
   from BBS skin. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) study revealed that the
   major absorption bands of gelatin from the skins of both sharks shifted
   to a higher wavenumber, compared with their corresponding acid soluble
   collagen (ASC). Therefore, gelatins from the skin of BBS has a potential
   to replace mammalian for gelatin, due to its similarity in bloom strength
   and setting behavior to the commercial bovine bone gelatin.

AB Accurate assessmentofsharkpopulationstatusisessentialfor
   conservationbutisoftenconstrained by limited and unreliable data. To
   provide a basis for improved management of shark resources, we analyzed a
   long-term record of species-specific catches, sizes, and sexes of sharks
   collected by onboard observers in the western and central Pacific Ocean
   from 1995 to 2010. Using generalized linear models, we estimated
   population-status indicators on the basis of catch rate and biological
   indicators of fishing pressure on the basis of median size to identify
   trends for blue (Prionace glauca), mako (Isurus spp.), oceanic whitetip
   (Carcharhinus longimanus), and silky (Carcharhinus falciformis) sharks.
   Standardized catch rates of longline fleets declined significantly for
   blue sharks in the North Pacific (by 5% per year (CI 2% to 8%)), for mako
   sharks in the North Pacific (by 7% per year (CI 3% to 11%)), and for
   oceanic whitetip sharks in tropical waters (by 17% per year (CI 14% to
   20%)). Median lengths of silky and oceanic whitetip sharks decreased
   significantly in their core habitat, and almost all sampled silky sharks
   were immature. Our results are consistent with results of analyses of
   similar data sets. Combined, these results and evidence of targeted
   fishing for sharks in some regional fisheries heighten concerns for
   sustainable utilization, particularly for oceanic whitetip and North
   Pacific blue sharks. Regional regulations that prohibit shark finning
   (removal of fins and discarding of the carcass) were enacted in 2007 and
   are in many cases the only form of control on shark catches. However,
   there is little evidence of a reduction of finning in longline fisheries.
   In addition, silky and oceanic whitetip sharks are more frequently
   retained than finned, which suggests that even full implementation of and
   adherence to a finning prohibition may not substantially reduce mortality
   rates for these species. We argue that finning prohibitions divert
   attention from assessing whether catch levels are sustainable and that
   the need for management of sharks should not be addressed by measures
   that are simple to implement but complex to enforce and evaluate.

AB The territorial fishing zones of Australia and Indonesia are contiguous
   to the north of Australia in the Timor and Arafura Seas and in the Indian
   Ocean to the north of Christmas Island. The area surrounding the shared
   boundary consists of a variety of bio-diverse marine habitats including
   shallow continental shelf waters, oceanic trenches and numerous offshore
   islands. Both countries exploit a variety of fisheries species, including
   whaler (Carcharhinus spp.) and hammerhead sharks (Sphyrna spp.). Despite
   their differences in social and financial arrangements, the two countries
   are motivated to develop complementary co-management practices to achieve
   resource sustainability. An essential starting point is knowledge of the
   degree of population subdivision, and hence fisheries stock status, in
   exploited species. Populations of four commercially harvested shark
   species (Carcharhinus obscurus, Carcharhinus sorrah, Prionace glauca,
   Sphyrna lewini) were sampled from northern Australia and central
   Indonesia. Neutral genetic markers (mitochondrial DNA control region
   sequence and allelic variation at co-dominant microsatellite loci)
   revealed genetic subdivision between Australian and Indonesian
   populations of C. sorrah. Further research is needed to address the
   possibility of genetic subdivision among C. obscurus populations. There
   was no evidence of genetic subdivision for P. glauca and S. lewini
   populations, but the sampling represented a relatively small part of
   their distributional range. For these species, more detailed analyses of
   population genetic structure is recommended in the future. Cooperative
   management between Australia and Indonesia is the best option at present
   for P. glauca and S. lewini, while C. sorrah and C. obscurus should be
   managed independently. On-going research on these and other exploited
   shark and ray species is strongly recommended. Biological and ecological
   similarity between species may not be a predictor of population genetic
   structure, so species-specific studies are recommended to provide new
   data to assist with sustainable fisheries management.

   preparations, was best seen in a 13-day specimen. The distribution of
   olfactory tract fibers is entirely ipsilateral to the lesion, the
   majority terminating near the attachment of the olfactory peduncle to the
   hemisphere. Terminal degeneration is restricted caudally to a tongue-like
   extension of the lateral olfactory area on the ventral surface of the
   hemisphere with a spill-over into the area superficialis basalis of
   Johnston. The results indicate that the distribution of olfactory bulb
   fibers in the shark is much more restricted than had been suggested by

AB The school shark fishery in south-eastern Australian waters has operated
   on a homogeneous stock which has a low reproductive potential. The
   species is slow-growing; the smallest mature males (120 cm) are over 8 yr
   of age and the smallest mature females (135 cm) are at least 2 yr older.
   The gestation period is approximately 6 months and it is estimated that
   only about half the female population bear young each year. Each gravid
   female carries 17-41 young with a mean number of 28. The lengths of the
   normal full-term embryos range from 280 to 350 mm with a mean for both
   sexes of 300 mm. The larger females tend to have the longest embryos.
   Slightly more male than female young (54 : 46) are born. Because the
   inshore populations of juveniles have been dwindling and the size of the
   older stock is decreasing, it is believed that this slow-growing species
   is being overfished. Measures aimed at protecting school sharks in their
   vulnerable stages have been proposed. Any conservation programme will be
   long-term as this shark has such a low reproductive capacity.

AB Abstract The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) contains a set of
   linked genes which encode cell surface proteins involved in the binding
   of small peptide antigens for their subsequent recognition by T
   lymphocytes. MHC proteins share structural features and the presence and
   location of polymorphic residues which play a role in the binding of
   antigens. In order to compare the structure of these molecules and gain
   insights into their evolution, we have isolated two MHC class IIB genes
   from the nurse shark, Ginglymostoma cirratum. Two clones, most probably
   alleles, encode proteins which differ by 13 amino acids located in the
   putative antigen-binding cleft. The protein structure and the location of
   polymorphic residues are similar to their mammalian counterparts.
   Although these genes appear to encode a typical MHC protein, no
   T-cell-mediated responses have been demonstrated in cartilaginous fish.
   The nurse shark represents the most phylogenetically primitive organism
   in which both class IIA [Kasahara, M., Vazquez, M., Sato, K., McKinney,
   E.C. & Flajnik, M.F. (1992) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci USA 89, 6688-6692] and

AB Knowledge of the age, growth and demography of an organism can be quite
   useful for managing its fishery. However, for many elasmobranch species,
   no valid estimates of age, growth and therefore age-specific mortality
   and natality rates are available. Thus, even though the distribution,
   abundance, habits and reproduction of a population may be known, no
   reliable estimates of population growth are possible. As a result,
   detailed demographic analysis has been completed for only a few shark
   species (e.g. the California leopard shark, Triakis semlfasciata). All
   age-determination techniques attempted for the Pacific angel shark
   (Squatina californica) have met with difficulties. Recently, however, we
   have accumulated data on 69 tag-recaptures and have used this information
   to model a von Bertalanffy growth function (VBGF) to predict the growth
   of this commercially exploited shark species. We performed a demographic
   analysis of this species, which yielded a net reproductive rate (R0) of
   2.25, a generation time (G) of 14.5 years, and an estimate of the
   instantaneous population growth coefficient (r) of 0.056 year-1, assuming
   that only natural mortality (M) was occurring, estimated to be 0.2
   year-1. When reasonable estimates of fishing mortality (F) are included
   in the survivorship function, Ro and r are reduced considerably.
   Presently, Pacific angel sharks first enter the fishery at the same size
   and age at which they first reproduce. Until accurate estimates of M and
   Fare available, it would be prudent to set a size limit considerably
   above the size at first reproduction to protect the Pacific angel shark
   in California.

AB The cartilaginous fish are the oldest phylogenetic group in which all of
   the molecular components of the adaptive immune system have been found.
   Although early studies clearly showed that sharks could produce an
   IgM-based response following immunization, evidence for memory, affinity
   maturation and roles for the other isotypes (notably IgNAR) in this group
   remained inconclusive. The data presented here illustrate that the nurse
   shark (Ginglymostoma cirratum) is able to produce not only an IgM
   response, but we also show for the first time a highly antigen-specific
   IgNAR response. Additionally, under appropriate conditions, a memory
   response for both isotypes can be elicited. Analysis of the response
   shows differential expression of pentameric and monomeric IgM. Pentameric
   IgM provides the ‘first line of defense’ through high-avidity,
   low-affinity interaction with antigen. In contrast, monomeric IgM and
   IgNAR seem responsible for the specific, antigen-driven response. We
   propose the presence of distinct lineages of B cells in sharks. As there
   is no conventional isotype switching, each lineage seems pre-determined
   to express a single isotype (IgM versus IgNAR). However, our data suggest
   that there may also be specific lineages for the different forms
   (pentameric versus monomeric) of the IgM isotype.

AB Summary Sharks, rays, and chimaeras (Class Chondrichthyes; herein
   ‘sharks') are the earliest extant jawed vertebrates and exhibit some of
   the greatest functional diversity of all vertebrates. Ecologically, they
   influence energy transfer vertically through trophic levels and sometimes
   trophic cascades via direct consumption and predation risk. Through
   movements and migrations, they connect horizontally and temporally across
   habitats and ecosystems, integrating energy flows at large spatial scales
   and across time. This connectivity flows from ontogenetic growth in size
   and spatial movements, which in turn underpins their relatively low
   reproductive rates compared with other exploited ocean fishes. Sharks are
   also ecologically and demographically diverse and are taken in a wide
   variety of fisheries for multiple products (e.g. meat, fins, teeth, and
   gills). Consequently, a range of fisheries management measures are
   generally preferable to ‘silver bullet' and ‘one size fits all'
   conservation actions. Some species with extremely low annual reproductive
   output can easily become endangered and hence require strict protections
   to minimize mortality. Other, more prolific species can withstand fishing
   over the long term if catches are subject to effective catch limits
   throughout the species' range. We identify, based on the IUCN Red List
   status, 64 endangered species in particular need of new or stricter
   protections and 514 species in need of improvements to fisheries
   management. We designate priority countries for such actions, recognizing
   the widely differing fishing pressures and conservation capacity. We hope
   that this analysis assists efforts to ensure this group of ecologically
   important and evolutionarily distinct animals can support both ocean
   ecosystems and human activities in the future.

AB Due to human activities, marine and terrestrial ecosystems face a future
   where disturbances are predicted to occur at a frequency and severity
   unprecedented in the recent past. Of particular concern is the ability of
   systems to recover where multiple stressors act simultaneously. We
   examine this issue in the context of a coral reef ecosystem where
   increases in stressors, such as fisheries, benthic degradation, cyclones
   and coral bleaching, are occurring at global scales. By utilizing
   long-term (decadal) monitoring programs, we examined the combined effects
   of chronic (removal of sharks) and pulse (cyclones, bleaching)
   disturbances on the trophic structure of coral reef fishes at two
   isolated atoll systems off the coast of northwest Australia. We provide
   evidence consistent with the hypothesis that the loss of sharks can have
   an impact that propagates down the food chain, potentially contributing
   to mesopredator release and altering the numbers of primary consumers.
   Simultaneously, we show how the effects of bottom-up processes of
   bleaching and cyclones appear to propagate up the food chain through
   herbivores, planktivores and corallivores, but do not affect carnivores.
   Because their presence may promote the abundance of herbivores, the
   removal of sharks by fishing has implications for both natural and
   anthropogenic disturbances involving the loss of corals, as herbivores
   are critical to the progress and outcome of coral recovery.

   tourists on whale sharks in Donsol, Philippines. Whale sharks feed in
   Donsol's nutrient rich waters between November and June, drawing up to
   7100 visitors annually. Tourist, tour operator, and whale shark behavior
   were examined during human–whale shark interactions (n = 777) on 117 boat
   trips (March, April and May) in 2004, and on 76 boat trips in 2005 (n =
   620). Average compliance to Code of Conduct regulations in 2004 and 2005
   was 44% for the minimum distance kept; 82% for no touching, no path
   obstruction and a maximum of six swimmers per whale shark; 89% for a
   maximum of one boat per shark, 99% for no flash photography and no SCUBA,
   scooters, and jet-skis. Significant predictors of whale shark's
   directional changes were path obstruction and proximity of swimmer to
   whale shark, while for whale shark's dive response it was first-time
   sighting and whale shark feeding. The significant predictor of a violent
   shudder behavior was touching. Generalized linear modeling evaluated
   change in direction, dive response and violent shuddering variables, and
   found that touching, flash photography, and swimmer diving towards the
   whale shark significantly affected the magnitude of disturbance. Tourism
   impacts on whale sharks can be minimized through adaptive management that
   monitors tourism and alters interaction regulations to reflect tourist
   and tour operator actions that have detrimental effects on whale sharks.

AB Abstract The Na,K-ATPase provides the driving force for many ion
   transport processes through control of Na+and K+ concentration gradients
   across the plasma membranes of animal cells. It is composed of two
   subunits, α and β. In many tissues, predominantly in kidney, it is
   associated with a small ancillary component, the γ-subunit that plays a
   modulatory role. A novel 15-kDa protein, sharing considerable homology to
   the γ-subunit and to phospholemman (PLM) was identified in purified
   Na,K-ATPase preparations from rectal glands of the shark Squalus
   acanthias, but was absent in pig kidney preparations. This PLM-like
   protein from shark (PLMS) was found to be a substrate for both PKA and
   PKC. Antibodies to the Na,K-ATPase α-subunit coimmunoprecipitated PLMS.
   Purified PLMS also coimmunoprecipitated with the α-subunit of pig kidney
   Na,K-ATPase, indicating specific association with different α-isoforms.
   Finally, PLMS and the α-subunit were expressed in stoichiometric amounts
   in rectal gland membrane preparations. Incubation of membrane bound
   Na,K-ATPase with non-solubilizing concentrations of C12E8resulted in
   functional dissociation of PLMS from Na,K-ATPase and increased the
   hydrolytic activity. The same effects were observed after PKC
   phosphorylation of Na,K-ATPase membrane preparations. Thus, PLMS may
   function as a modulator of shark Na,K-ATPase in a way resembling the
   phospholamban regulation of the Ca-ATPase.

AB The new antigen receptor (NAR) gene in the nurse shark diversifies
   extensively by somatic hypermutation. It is not known, however, whether
   NAR somatic hypermutation generates the primary repertoire (like in the
   sheep) or rather is used in antigen-driven immune responses. To address
   this issue, the sequences of NAR transmembrane (Tm) and secretory (Sec)
   forms, presumed to represent the primary and secondary repertoires,
   respectively, were examined from the peripheral blood lymphocytes of
   three adult nurse sharks. More than 40% of the Sec clones but fewer than
   11% of Tm clones contained five mutations or more. Furthermore, more than
   75% of the Tm clones had few or no mutations. Mutations in the Sec clones
   occurred mostly in the complementarity-determining regions (CDR) with a
   significant bias toward replacement substitutions in CDR1; in Tm clones
   there was no significant bias toward replacements and only a low level of
   targeting to the CDRs. Unlike the Tm clones where the replacement
   mutational pattern was similar to that seen for synonymous changes, Sec
   replacements displayed a distinct pattern of mutations. The types of
   mutations in NAR were similar to those found in mouse Ig genes rather
   than to the unusual pattern reported for shark and Xenopus Ig. Finally,
   an oligoclonal family of Sec clones revealed a striking trend toward
   acquisition of glutamic/aspartic acid, suggesting some degree of
   selection. These data strongly suggest that hypermutation of NAR does not
   generate the repertoire, but instead is involved in antigen-driven immune
   responses.

AB : Sexually mature male bottlenose dolphins in Shark Bay cooperate by
   pursuing distinct alliance strategies to monopolize females in
   reproductive condition. We present the results of a comprehensive study
   in a wild cetacean population to test whether male alliance membership is
   a prerequisite for reproductive success. We compared two methods for
   inferring paternity: both calculate a likelihood ratio, called the
   paternity index, between two opposing hypotheses, but they differ in the
   way that significance is applied to the data. The first method, a
   Bayesian approach commonly used in human paternity testing, appeared to
   be overly conservative for our data set, but would be less susceptible to
   assumptions if a larger number of microsatellite loci had been used.
   Using the second approach, the computer program cervus 2.0, we
   successfully assigned 11 paternities to nine males, and 17 paternities to
   14 out of 139 sexually mature males at 95% and 80% confidence levels,
   respectively. It appears that being a member of a bottlenose dolphin
   alliance is not a prerequisite for paternity: two paternities were
   obtained by juvenile males (one at the 95%, the other at the 80%
   confidence level), suggesting that young males without alliance partners
   pursue different mating tactics to adults. Likelihood analyses showed
   that these two juvenile males were significantly more likely to be the
   true father of the offspring than to be their half-sibling (P < 0.05).
   Using paternity data at an 80% confidence level, we could show that
   reproductive success was significantly skewed within at least some stable
   first-order alliances (P < 0.01). Interestingly, there is powerful
   evidence that one mating was incestuous, with one calf apparently
   fathered by its mother's father (P < 0.01). Our study suggests that the
   reproductive success of both allied males, and of nonallied juveniles,
   needs to be incorporated into an adaptive framework that seeks to explain
   alliance formation in male bottlenose dolphins.

AB The biology of Australian reef populations of the shark Heterodontus
   portusjacksoni has been studied underwater with SCUBA. Additional
   life—history data have been obtained from catch records of adults and
   juveniles and from observations on captive animals. The mature breeding
   female H. portusjacksoni lays 10—16 eggs which are deposited in rock
   fissures on shallow reefs; the young emerge approximately 1 year later.
   The breeding season on the central coast of New South Wales occurs in
   late winter and spring. This species appears to segregate by sex into
   separate juvenile, adolescent, and adult populations. A slow growth rate
   and protracted immaturity is characteristic. Sexual maturity is reached
   at 8—10 years for males and 11—14 years for females. Most feeding occurs
   during darkness over both reefs and soft substrates, gut contents reveal
   that they feed on a variety of benthic invertebrates. Populations of H.
   portusjacksoni observed on sublittoral reefs consisted of adult sharks,
   the majority of which were females. A few specific sites, usually caves
   in which they shelter during the day, are preferred. Resightings of
   sharks tagged on a reef at Bondi, Sydney, revealed that animals which
   formed the local population moved freely to and from the reef and also
   between the several sites on the reef. Reef densities were highest during
   the breeding season and were correlated with low water temperatures.
   Emigration from inshore reefs occurs at the end of the breeding season in
   late September and October. A number of tagged sharks returned to the
   same reef in the following year and others after periods of up to 2
   years. Recaptures made outside the Sydney area indicate that some sharks
   may travel several hundred kilometers during their migration.

AB Parthenogenesis has been documented in all major jawed vertebrate
   lineages except mammals and cartilaginous fishes (class Chondrichthyes:
   sharks, batoids and chimeras). Reports of captive female sharks giving
   birth despite being held in the extended absence of males have generally
   been ascribed to prior matings coupled with long-term sperm storage by
   the females. Here, we provide the first genetic evidence for
   chondrichthyan parthenogenesis, involving a hammerhead shark (Sphyrna
   tiburo). This finding also broadens the known occurrence of a specific
   type of asexual development (automictic parthenogenesis) among
   vertebrates, extending recently raised concerns about the potential
   negative effect of this type of facultative parthenogenesis on the
   genetic diversity of threatened vertebrate species.

AB In order to trace their feeding habits, stable carbon and nitrogen
   isotope ratios (d 15 N and d 13 C), as well as trace metal concentrations
   (Zn, Cd, Fe, Cu, Se and Hg) were analysed in the tissues of five
   commercial shark species from the Celtic Sea: the tope shark Galeorhinus
   galeus, the black-mouthed catshark Galeus melastomus, the starry smooth
   hound Mustelus asterias, the spiny dogfish Squalus acanthias and the
   lesser-spotted dogfish Scyliorhinus canicula. Our results were compared
   to previously described stomach contents and isotopic composition of
   potential preys. Isotopic ratio d 15 N suggested that tope sharks fed at
   a higher trophic level (16.7& in the muscle) than the other species,
   reflecting its piscivorous diet. The lower values of spiny dogfish (11.6&
   in the muscle) might be explained, amongst other things, by either its
   migratory behaviour or its preference for preys from lower trophic
   levels. Cd and Hg were correlated with isotopic ratios d 13 C and d 15 N,
   and were shown to be diet-related whereas Zn, Fe and Cu seemed much more
   linked to species-specific metabolism. Although this multidisciplinary
   approach is revealed as a useful tool for the study of shark ecology, the
   lack of known trophic fractionation suggests that isotopic data be
   compared to traditional diet analyses. 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   conducted in Florida Bay and Tampa Bay, Florida from September 1982 to
   December 1986. The maintenance of sharks in captivity at the Marine
   Science and Conservation Center in the Florida Keys, and the collection
   of sharks from widely separated geographical areas allowed the
   examination of latitudinal variation in reproduction. Several
   reproductive parameters were found to differ: (1) size at maturation, (2)
   age at maturation, (3) time of fertilization, (4) rate of embryonic
   development, (5) size at birth, (6) the energetic investment in producing
   offspring, (7) gestation period, and (8) the incidence of infertility.
   Average litter size and maximum age of females was not different between
   the two populations. These contrasting life history parameters are not
   easily explained. Food limitation and seasonal differences between the
   two areas are considered as factors controlling reproduction in these
   populations. It is noteworthy that the average size of adult females in
   Tampa Bay is significantly greater than that of Florida Keys sharks. This
   size difference may be important in explaining the observed differences
   in reproduction.

   Atlantic Ocean coast of South Carolina (Atlantic). Sequencing of the
   complete mitochondrial control region of 169 neonates revealed 10
   polymorphic sites and 13 haplotypes. Overall haplotype diversity and
   percent nucleotide diversity were 0.710 and 0.106%, respectively.
   Haplotype frequencies were compared among nurseries to determine if the
   high mobility and seasonal migrations of adult blacktip sharks have
   maintained genetic homogeneity among nurseries in the Atlantic and Gulf.
   Chi-square analysis and AMOVA did not detect significant structuring of
   haplotypes among the three Gulf nurseries, P(χ2)=0.294, ΦST=−0.005 to
   −0.002. All pairwise AMOVA between Gulf nurseries and the Atlantic
   nursery detected significant partitioning of haplotypes between the Gulf
   and Atlantic (ΦST=0.087–0.129, P<0.008), as did comparison between
   grouped Florida Gulf nurseries and the Atlantic, ΦCT=0.090, P<0.001.
   Based upon the dispersal abilities and seasonal migrations of blacktip
   sharks, these results support the presence of philopatry for nursery
   areas among female blacktip sharks. Our data also support the treatment
   of Atlantic and Gulf blacktip shark nursery areas as separate management

   properties such as water vapour barrier and flexibility due to their
   hydrophobicity and plasticizing effect, respectively. Addition of stearic
   acid from 0% to 100% of protein concentration in the film-forming
   solution considerably decreased water vapour permeability of
   gelatin–fatty acid emulsion films compared to addition of oleic acid at
   the same fatty acid concentration. Increasing concentrations of both
   fatty acids decreased tensile strength, but increased elongation at break
   due to their plasticizing effect. At the same concentration, oleic acid
   gave a greater plasticizing effect than did stearic acid. On the other
   hand, transparency of the gelatin–stearic acid emulsion film was lower
   than that of the gelatin–oleic acid emulsion film. Faster stirring speed

AB The new antigen receptor (IgNAR) family has been detected in all
   elasmobranch species so far studied and has several intriguing structural
   and functional features. IgNAR protein, found in both transmembrane and
   secretory forms, is a dimer of heavy chains with no associated light
   chains, with each chain of the dimer having a single free and flexible V
   region. Four rearrangement events (among 1V, 3D, and 1J germline genes)
   generate an expressed NAR V gene, resulting in long and diverse CDR3
   regions that contain cysteine residues. IgNAR mutation frequency is very
   high and "selected" mutations are found only in genes encoding the
   secreted form, suggesting that the primary repertoire is entirely
   CDR3-based. Here we further analyzed the two IgNAR types, "type 1" having
   one cysteine in CDR3 and "type 2" with an even number (two or four) of
   CDR3 cysteines, and discovered that placement of the disulfide bridges in
   the IgNAR V domain differentially influences the selection of mutations
   in CDR1 and CDR2. Ontogenetic analyses showed that IgNAR sequences from
   young animals were infrequently mutated, consistent with the paradigm
   that the shark immune system must become mature before high levels of
   mutation accompanied with selection can occur. Nevertheless, also in
   agreement with the idea that the IgNAR repertoire is entirely CDR3-based,
   but unlike studies in most other vertebrates, N-region diversity is
   present in expressed IgNAR clones at birth. During the investigation of
   this early IgNAR repertoire we serendipitously detected a third type of
   IgNAR gene that is expressed in all neonatal tissues; later in life its
   expression is perpetuated only in the epigonal organ, a tissue recently
   shown to be a (the?) primary lymphoid tissue in elasmobranchs. This "type
   3" IgNAR gene still undergoes three rearrangement events (two D regions
   are "germline-joined"), yet CDR3 sequences were exactly of the same
   length and very similar sequence, suggesting that "type 3" CDR3s are
   selected early in ontogeny, perhaps by a self-ligand.

   For combined sexes, the von Bertalanffy growth parameters were L∞ = 110.8
   cm total length, K = 0.39 year–1 and to = –0.86 year during 1984 and L∞ =
   94.0 cm total length, K = 0.73 year–1 and to = –0.88 year during
   1998–2001. Median size for males and females at maturity decreased from
   approximately 78.3 and 80.2 cm total length (TL), respectively, in
   1979–1980 to 72.6 and 75.8 cm TL, respectively, in 1998–2001. Age at
   maturity for combined sexes also decreased from 2.3 years in 1979–1980 to
   1.4 years in 1998–2001. Litter size was similar between periods (5.0
   embryos), as was the average size of embryos close to parturition (32 cm
   TL; 130–150 g). Growth rates using observed mean size-at-age data were
   higher from 1998–2001 for early ages (0–2.5 years). The observed decrease
   in maturity and increased growth rate lends support to the hypothesis of
   a compensatory response, although it could not be fully determined

   parallel supercomputer. Tiger Shark's primary features are support for
   continuous time data, scalability, high availability, and manageability,
   all of which are crucial in its role in large-scale video servers.
   Interestingly, most of the features that make Tiger Shark a good video
   server are important for other large-scale applications such as technical
   computing, data mining, digital library, and scalable network file

AB Abstract Shark immunoglobulin new antigen receptor (IgNAR, also referred
   to as NAR) variable domains (Vs) are single-domain antibody (sdAb)
   fragments containing only two hypervariable loop structures forming 3D
   topologies for a wide range of antigen recognition and binding. Their
   small size (∼12 kDa) and high solubility, thermostability and binding
   specificity make IgNARs an exceptional alternative source of engineered
   antibodies for sensor applications. Here, two new shark NAR V display
   libraries containing >10 7 unique clones from non-immunized (naive) adult
   spiny dogfish ( Squalus acanthias ) and smooth dogfish ( Mustelus canis )
   sharks were constructed. The most conserved consensus sequences derived
   from random clone sequence were compared with published nurse shark (
   Ginglymostoma cirratum ) sequences. Cholera toxin (CT) was chosen for
   panning one of the naive display libraries due to its severe
   pathogenicity and commercial availability. Three very similar CT binders
   were selected and purified soluble monomeric anti-CT sdAbs were
   characterized using Luminex 100 and traditional ELISA assays. These novel
   anti-CT sdAbs selected from our newly constructed shark NAR V sdAb
   library specifically bound to soluble antigen, without cross reacting
   with other irrelevant antigens. They also showed superior heat stability,
   exhibiting slow loss of activity over the course of one hour at high
   temperature (95 °C), while conventional antibodies lost all activity in
   the first 5–10 min. The successful isolation of target specific sdAbs
   from one of our non-biased NAR libraries, demonstrate their ability to
   provide binders against an unacquainted antigen of interest.

AB Abstract Chondroitin sulfate (CS) and dermatan sulfate (DS) hybrid chains
   of proteoglycans are critical in growth factor binding, neuritogenesis,
   and brain development. Here we isolated CS/DS hybrid chains from shark
   skin aiming to develop therapeutic agents. Digestion with various
   chondroitinases showed that both GlcUA- and IdoUA-containing
   disaccharides are scattered along the polysaccharide chains with an
   unusually large average molecular mass of 70 kDa. The CS/DS chains were
   separated into major (80%) and minor (20%) fractions by anion-exchange
   chromatography. Both fractions had relatively low degrees of sulfation
   (sulfate/disaccharide molar ratio = 1.17 versus 0.87), showing a unique
   feature compared with the marine CS and DS isolated to date, most of
   which are oversulfated. They were highly heterogeneous and characterized
   by multiple disaccharides including GlcUA-GalNAc, GlcUA-GalNAc(6S),
   GlcUA-GalNAc(4S), IdoUA-GalNAc(4S), GlcUA-GalNAc(4S,6S),
   IdoUA-GalNAc(4S,6S), GlcUA(2S)-GalNAc(6S), and/or IdoUA(2S)-GalNAc(6S),
   IdoUA(2S)-GalNAc(4S) and novel GlcUA(2S)-GalNAc(4S), where 2S, 4S, and 6S
   represent 2-O-, 4-O- and 6-O-sulfate, respectively. The CS/DS chains
   bound two neurotrophic factors and various growth factors expressed in
   the brain with high affinity as evaluated for the major fraction by
   kinetic analysis using a surface plasmon resonance detector, and also
   promoted the outgrowth of neurites of both an axonic and a dendritic
   nature. The neuritogenic activity was abolished completely by digestion
   with chondroitinase ABC, AC-I, or B, suggesting the importance of both
   GlcUA- and IdoUA-containing moieties. It also showed anti-heparin
   cofactor II activity comparable to that exhibited by DS from porcine
   skin. Thus, by virtue of its unique structure and biological activities,
   DS will find a potential use in therapeutics.

   belonging to five families, and three orders of sharks were measured to
   determine the influence of habitat, diet, and possible species-specific
   fractionation effects on the isotopic composition of biogenic phosphate
   from fish. The sharks were recently caught in subtropical waters off the
   KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) coast of South Africa, as well as from cold waters in
   Prince William Sound (PWS), Alaska, and Victor Bay (VB), Nunavut, Canada.
   δ 18 O values of tooth phosphate (δ 18 O P ) range from 20.9 to 23.5‰ for
   the KZN sharks. For most species the range in measured δ 18 O P values is
   about 0.6‰, but it may be as high as 1.1‰ for different teeth from a
   single shark. Dentine and enameloid within individual teeth have no
   apparent differences in δ 18 O P values. The δ 18 O P values of the KZN
   shark teeth reflect the typical habitat of the studied species, primarily
   the thermal structure of the water column off KZN at depths between 20
   and 280 m. The δ 18 O P values of teeth from different Greenland sharks
   from VB and Pacific sleeper sharks from PWS are very homogeneous,
   averaging 25.8 and 24.7‰, respectively. These values appear to be in
   equilibrium with deep (>500 m) ocean waters in each case at temperatures
   of about −0.3°C or less. There is little discernable evidence for
   species-specific fractionation effects for the oxygen isotope composition
   of phosphate in the studied marine fish. The oxygen isotope composition
   of carbonate in apatite averages about 9.1‰ higher than corresponding δ
   18 O P values, in agreement with equilibrium fractionation between
   carbonate and phosphate, but with a large variance (1σ = ±1.5‰). δ 18 O C
   values also vary by up to 1‰ between enameloid and dentine within single
   teeth, but in a non-systematic way. Differences in δ 13 C values between
   carbonate in enameloid and dentine is also large (up to 8‰) but the δ 13
   C values vary systematically. Enameloid is always enriched in 13 C
   compared to dentine and the 13 C content increases with developmental
   stage of the teeth. δ 13 C values measured for enameloid (1.6 to 4.8‰)
   appear to approach equilibrium with dissolved inorganic carbon in
   seawater. In contrast, δ 13 C values for dentine range from −6.4 to −2.3‰
   for KZN sharks, and −9.0 to −10.8‰ for the cold-water sleeper sharks, and
   are compatible with a predominantly dietary carbon source. The 87 Sr/ 86
   Sr ratios of teeth from KZN sharks as well as those from PWS and VB are
   uniform, averaging 0.709167. Sr content varies from 1270 to 2100 ppm, a
   range that is similar to that in well preserved fossilized teeth.
   Seawater Sr is thus clearly incorporated in vivo. Concentrations of Sm
   and Nd are in the ppb range and contrast the ppm range in fossilized
   teeth, indicating a postmortem incorporation of rare earth elements in
   apatite of the teeth.

   protective meshing programme using both large mesh gill-nets and set
   lines. The size at birth was estimated to be 80-90 cm total length, and
   females matured at approximately 287 cm total length. Litter sizes ranged
   from 6 to 56. Breeding and pupping both appear to occur in summer, with
   females not breeding every year. Mature females possibly migrate inshore
   during late spring and summer to give birth. The sex ratio of juveniles
   and adults favoured females, with few adult males being caught. Ontogenic
   changes in the diet were observed, with juveniles feeding predominantly
   on teleosts, sea snakes and birds and adults mostly consuming teleosts,
   sea snakes, turtles and crabs. There was no apparent decrease in the
   population size of G. cuvier in the Townsville area as a result of the
   long-term catching of sharks by the protective meshing programme.

AB Background The scalloped hammerhead shark, Sphyrna lewini, is a large
   endangered predator with a circumglobal distribution, observed in the
   open ocean but linked ontogenetically to coastal embayments for
   parturition and juvenile development. A previous survey of maternal
   (mtDNA) markers demonstrated strong genetic partitioning overall (global
   ΦST = 0.749) and significant population separations across oceans and
   between discontinuous continental coastlines. Methodology/Principal
   Findings We surveyed the same global range with increased sample coverage
   (N = 403) and 13 microsatellite loci to assess the male contribution to
   dispersal and population structure. Biparentally inherited
   microsatellites reveal low or absent genetic structure across ocean
   basins and global genetic differentiation (FST = 0.035) over an order of
   magnitude lower than the corresponding measures for maternal mtDNA
   lineages (ΦST = 0.749). Nuclear allelic richness and heterozygosity are
   high throughout the Indo-Pacific, while genetic structure is low. In
   contrast, allelic diversity is low while population structure is higher
   for populations at the ends of the range in the West Atlantic and East
   Pacific. Conclusions/Significance These data are consistent with the
   proposed Indo-Pacific center of origin for S. lewini, and indicate that
   females are philopatric or adhere to coastal habitats while males
   facilitate gene flow across oceanic expanses. This study includes the
   largest sampling effort and the most molecular loci ever used to survey
   the complete range of a large oceanic predator, and findings emphasize
   the importance of incorporating mixed-marker analysis into stock
   assessments of threatened and endangered shark species.

AB Abstract In the 160 years since Andrew Smith described the whale shark in
   1828, two people devoted much of their scientific lives to whale sharks.
   This period of research mainly comprised documenting the known sightings,
   captures and strandings of this species. Dr Eugene Gudger collected
   reports of whale sharks from all over the world and published 47 papers
   on these sharks in 40 years. Dr Fay Wolfson also documented whale shark
   records from all over the world and published a bibliography on the
   species as well as a paper summarising all the known (320) occurrences
   from published records and verified reports up to 1985. However, life
   history information during this period was scant. In the succeeding 20
   years from 1986, there has been a huge increase in recreational diving
   and boating activity around the world that has led to discoveries of
   whale shark aggregations in various places. Together with increased
   demand and prices for whale shark products this has led to considerable
   conservation and marine ecotourism interest in the species that has
   provided the impetus for a number of studies. However, while some further
   understanding of whale shark reproduction and age and growth has
   resulted, our knowledge of the species biology and ecology is still poor.
   Over the last 10 years several tagging and tracking studies have been
   initiated on whale sharks in various parts of the world. Despite the
   relatively recent increases in demand for whale shark meat driven by the
   Taiwan market, there are still few good data in the primary literature
   from existing fisheries.

AB : A remarkable example of a misleading mitochondrial protein tree is
   presented, involving ray-finned fishes, coelacanths, lungfishes, and
   tetrapods, with sea lampreys as an outgroup. In previous molecular
   phylogenetic studies on the origin of tetrapods, ray-finned fishes have
   been assumed as an outgroup to the tetrapod/lungfish/coelacanth clade, an
   assumption supported by morphological evidence. Standard methods of
   molecular phylogenetics applied to the protein-encoding genes of
   mitochondria, however, give a bizarre tree in which lamprey groups with
   lungfish and, therefore, ray-finned fishes are not the outgroup to a
   tetrapod/lungfish/coelacanth clade. All of the dozens of published
   phylogenetic methods, including every possible modification to maximum
   likelihood known to us (such as inclusion of site heterogeneity and
   exclusion of potentially misleading hydrophobic amino acids), fail to
   place the ray-finned fishes in a biologically acceptable position. A
   likely cause of this failure may be the use of an inappropriate outgroup.
   Accordingly, we have determined the complete mitochondrial DNA sequence
   from the shark, Mustelus manazo, which we have used as an alternative and
   more proximal outgroup than the lamprey. Using sharks as the outgroup,
   lungfish appear to be the closest living relative of tetrapods, although
   the possibility of a lungfish/coelacanth clade being the sister group of
   tetrapods cannot be excluded.

   using a water tunnel facility has been performed to investigate the flow
   field over and within a bristled shark skin model submerged within a
   boundary layer to deduce the possible boundary layer control mechanisms
   being used by these fast-swimming sharks. Fluorescent dye flow
   visualization provides evidence of the formation of embedded cavity
   vortices within the scales. Digital particle image velocimetry (DPIV)
   data, used to evaluate the cavity vortex formation and boundary layer
   characteristics close to the surface, indicate increased momentum in the
   slip layer forming above the scales. This increase in flow velocity close
   to the shark's skin is indicative of boundary layer control mechanisms
   leading to separation control and possibly transition delay for the

AB Bottlenose dolphins, Tursiops cf. aduncus, in Shark Bay, Western
   Australia exhibit the most complex alliances known outside of humans.
   Advances in our understanding of these alliances have occurred with
   expansions of our study area each decade. In the 1980s, we discovered
   that males cooperated in stable trios and pairs (first-order alliances)
   to herd individual oestrous females, and that two such alliances of four
   to six, sometimes related, individuals (second-order alliances)
   cooperated against other males in contests over females. The 1990s saw
   the discovery of a large 14-member second-order alliance whose members
   exhibited labile first-order alliance formation among nonrelatives.
   Partner preferences as well as a relationship between first-order
   alliance stability and consortship rate in this ‘super-alliance’
   indicated differentiated relationships. The contrast between the
   super-alliance and the 1980s alliances suggested two alliance tactics. An
   expansion of the study area in the 2000s revealed a continuum of
   second-order alliance sizes in an open social network and no simple
   relationship between second-order alliance size and alliance stability,
   but generalized the relationship between first-order alliance stability
   and consortship rate within second-order alliances. Association
   preferences and contests involving three second-order alliances indicated
   the presence of third-order alliances. Second-order alliances may persist
   for 20 years with stability thwarted by gradual attrition, but underlying
   flexibility is indicated by observations of individuals joining other
   alliances, including old males joining young or old second-order
   alliances. The dolphin research has informed us on the evolution of
   complex social relationships and large brain evolution in mammals and the
   ecology of alliance formation. Variation in odontocete brain size and the
   large radiation of delphinids into a range of habitats holds great
   promise that further effort to describe their societies will be rewarded
   with similar advances in our understanding of these important issues.

AB We describe a method, radio-acoustic-positioning (RAP), for continuously

   ultrasonic transmitter on the animal can be localized with high spatial
   accuracy (2 to 10 m) within an area of 1 km2, based on when the same
   pulse arrives at three hydrophones on sonobuoys aligned in a triangular
   array. Radio transceivers communicate with the base station, where the x
   and y coordinates of the subject are calculated using hyperbolic
   equations. The base station plots the individual's position and displays
   information from the tag's sensors in real time on a computer monitor
   before saving the data on a disk. The base station must be situated
   either on land or on a vessel within the reception range of the three
   buoys. We used a RAP system to monitor the movements and behavior of
   white sharks (Carcharodon carcharias) near the elephant seal rookery at
   Ano Nuevo Island in central California. This type of system is an ideal
   tool to study the predatory behavior of the white shark because
   individuals patrol for seal prey within a zone <1300 m from shore. We
   describe the operation of the system, including acoustic triangulation,
   range of detection and positioning, data acquisition and analysis, and
   positional accuracy. We illustrate the implementation of the method and
   its advantages and disadvantages by describing an ongoing study of white
   shark hunting-behavior. Sample data from this study are presented to
   illustrate specific points. We describe the movements of five sharks
   within the receiving range and their behavior relative to each other. The
   RAP system is compared to other complementary tracking methods. We
   conclude that this system has great potential for monitoring the
   movements and behavior of large marine animals within a relatively small
   zone, where feeding or reproduction takes place.

TI Diets of thornback ray (Raja clavata) and tope shark (Galeorhinus galeus)
   in the bottom longline fishery of the Azores, northeastern Atlantic
PY 2003
AB Tope shark (Galeorhinus galeus) and thornback ray (Raja clavata) are the
   two most captured elasmobranch species by the Azorean bottom longline
   fishery. In order to better understand the trophic dynamics of these
   species in the Azores, the diets of thornback ray and tope shark caught
   in this area during 1996 and 1997 were analyzed to describe feeding
   patterns and to investigate the effect of sex, size, and depth and area
   of capture on diet. Thornback rays fed mainly upon fishes and reptants,
   but also upon polychaetes, mysids, natant crustaceans, isopods, and
   cephalopods. In the Azores, this species preyed more heavily upon fish
   compared with the predation patterns described in other areas.
   Differences in the diet may be due to differences in the environments
   (e.g. in the Azores, seamounts and oceanic islands are the major
   topographic features, whereas in all other studies, continental shelves
   have been the major topographic feature). No differences were observed in
   the major prey consumed between the sexes or between size classes (49−60,
   61−70, 71−80, and 81−93 cm TL). Our study indicates that rays inhabiting
   different depths and areas (coastal or offshore banks) prey upon
   different resources. This appears to be related to the relative abundance
   of prey with habitat. Tope sharks were found to prey almost exclusively
   upon teleost fish: small shoaling fish, mainly boarfish (Capros aper) and
   snipefish (Macroramphosus scolopax), were the most frequent prey. This
   study illustrates that thornback rays and tope sharks are top predators
   in waters off the Azores.

AB Aerial surveys between 1989 and 1992 demonstrated that large numbers of
   whale sharks appear on Ningaloo Reef in north-western Australia during
   autumn, shortly after the coral has undergone mass spawning. This
   movement into the reef waters would allow whale sharks to capitalize on
   the increased production of zooplankton brought about as a result of this
   mass spawning of corals and other marine organisms. Sharks occupied
   mainly the relatively turbid waters on the reef front, where a northerly
   current prevailed, rather than the offshore, warmer waters of the
   southerly flowing Leeuwin Current. The sharks moved in to the reef front
   from offshore but, once inshore, the majority swam parallel to the reef.
   The maximum density in any sector of the reef at any one time was four
   sharks per km, recorded in May 1992. The longer the time since sharks
   first appeared on the reef, the greater was their tendency to aggregate
   in a particular region of the reef. Evidence is presented that indicates
   that whale shark numbers at the northern end of Ningaloo Reef declined
   during the latter half of the 1980s; this decline may be related to the
   massive destruction of coral by the gastropod mollusc Drupella cornus
   during this period.

AB Abstract Acid soluble collagen (ASC) and pepsin soluble collagen (PSC)
   from the cartilages of brownbanded bamboo shark (BBS; Chiloscyllium
   punctatum ) and blacktip shark (BTS; Carcharhinus limbatus ) were
   isolated and characterized. ASC and PSC extracted from BBS cartilage
   showed the yields of 1.27 and 9.59 g/100 g (Based on dry weight),
   respectively, while yields of ASC and PSC from BTS cartilage were 1.04
   and 10.30 g/100 g (based on dry weight), respectively. All collagens had
   protein as a major constituent with the trace amount of ash and fat. They
   contained glycine as the major amino acid with high contents of alanine,
   proline and hydroxyproline. Based on sodium dodecyl
   sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoretic patterns and subunit
   compositions, all collagens more likely comprised 2 types of collagen,
   type I and II, and contained α- and β-chains as the major components.
   Peptide maps of those collagens from both species digested by V8-protease
   and lysyl endopeptidase were different and were completely different from
   those of type I collagen from calf skin. Thermal transition temperature
   of ASC from those collagens (36.28–36.73 °C) was slightly higher than
   their corresponding PSC (34.56–35.98 °C). From zeta potential analysis,
   isoelectric points (pI) of collagen from the cartilages of BBS and BTS
   were estimated to be from 6.53 to 7.03 and from 6.96 to 7.26,
   respectively. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra of both ASC and
   PSC were quite similar, suggesting that pepsin hydrolysis did not affect
   the secondary structure of collagen, especially triple-helical structure.

AB A young of the year female white shark, Carcharodon carcharias, was
   tagged with a pop-up satellite archival tag off Southern California in
   early June of 2000. The tag was recovered after 28 days, and records of
   temperature, depth and light intensity were extracted. Depth and
   temperature records indicate a number of interesting behaviors, including
   a strong diurnal pattern. At night the shark remained in the top 50 m,
   often making shallow repetitive vertical excursions. Most dives below the
   mixed layer were observed during the day, 91% of which occurred from
   05:00 to 21:00 h, with depths extending to 240 m. Many of the dives
   exhibited secondary vertical movements that were consistent with the
   shark swimming at the bottom (at depths from 9 to 165 m) where it was
   most likely foraging. The white shark experienced dramatic and rapid
   changes in temperature, and demonstrated a considerable tolerance for
   cold waters. Temperatures ranged from 9°C to 22°C, and although 89% of
   the total time was spent in waters 16–22°C, on some days the small shark
   spent as much as 32% of the time in 12°C waters. The deep dives into cold
   waters separate the white sharks from mako sharks, which share the
   California Bight nursery ground but appear to remain primarily in the
   mixed layer and thermocline. Movement information (derived from
   light-based geolocation, bottom depths and sea surface temperatures)
   indicated that the white shark spent the 28 days in the Southern
   California Bight, possibly moving as far south as San Diego, California.
   While the abundance and diversity of prey, warm water and separation from
   adults make this region an ideal nursery ground, the potential for
   interaction with the local fisheries should be examined.

AB The nonolfactory afferents to the telencephalon of the nurse shark were
   determined by tracking ascending degenerating fibers with silver
   impregnation techniques. Of the three ascending fiber bundles, the
   largest tract is entirely crossed and terminates in a central
   telencephalic nucleus. The smaller ipsilateral tract ascends laterally
   and terminates predominantly in the same cell group, but a few reach a
   more lateral region. The third group of ascending fibers is in the
   ventromedial bundle, and they terminate in basal areas primarily
   ipsilaterally but have a small contralateral component. At least a
   portion of the latter originate from levels caudal to the diencephalon.
   It can be concluded that the telencephalon of sharks is not entirely an
   olfactory structure but has similarities to mammalian
   thalamotelencephalic organization.

   have a defined seasonal cycle in GSI and a defined mating season, 2)
   species that have a defined seasonal cycle in GSI and that mate
   year-round, 3) species that show no seasonal change in GSI but that have
   a defined mating season, and 4) species that show no seasonal change in
   GSI but that mate year-round. The testis of S. tiburo differs from the
   few species that have been examined in that 1) not all spermatogenic
   stages are present at all times of the year, 2) an annual zone of
   degeneration that progresses through the testis is not present, and 3)
   there appears to be complete testicular regression and recrudescence.

   in the northwestern Alantic and Gulf of Mexico were estimated from bands
   formed seasonally in the vertebral centra. The tiger shark grows rapidly
   compared with many other shark species. Growth rates for Gulf of Mexico
   juveniles were faster than for Atlantic juveniles. This produced
   significantly different (P < 0.01) estimates of the parameters of von
   Bertalanffy curves for the two regional samples. With sexes combined,
   parameter estimates for the Gulf of Mexico sample were L"" = 388 cm TL. K
   "" 0.184. to = -1.13 years; for the Atlantic sample they were L"" = 440
   cm TL, K = 0.107, to = -2.35 years. Males mature at approx­ imately 310
   cm TL, females at 315-320 cm TL, but the regional differences in juvenile
   growth rates result in different ages at maturity. In the Gulf of Mexico.
   males mature in 7 years. females in 8 years; in the Atlantic. males and
   females both mature in approximately 10 years. The largest male and
   female examined (381 cm TL) were 15 and 16 years of age. The tiger shark,
   Galeocerdo cuvieri, is cosmopolitan in warm-temperate and tropical
   coastal and oceanic waters of the western North Atlantic (Castro 1983).
   It is usually found alone or in small groups of three to six individuals
   distributed rather homogeneous­ ly over most bottom types (Springer
   1963), Because of its large size, it is one of the most frequent en­
   tries in recreational fishing tournaments, and it occurs regularly, but
   in low numbers, in longline catches (Clark and von Schmidt 1965; Dodrill
   1977; Branstetter 1981, 1986). Along the U.S. Atlantic coast, the tiger
   shark occurs year-round off Florida, migrates as far north as Cape Cod in
   summer (Casey 1964), and returns to more southerly latitudes in fall
   (Musick et al. 1985). In the Gulf of Mexico, the species occurs in
   coastal waters from spring through fall, and in deeper continental shelf
   and offshore regions year-round (Branstetter 1981, 1986). The low catch
   rates and semisolitary nature of the tiger shark have hindered a
   comprehensive study of its biology. The tiger shark is both a scavenger
   (Gudger 1949; Clark and von Schmidt 1965) and euryphagous predator (Bass
   et al. 1975; Dodrill and Gilmore 1978). Information on the reproductive
   biology of the tiger shark must be gleaned from scat

AB Tiger sharks are important predators in the seagrass ecosystem of Shark
   Bay, Australia. Although sharks appear to return to a long-term study
   site within the Eastern Gulf periodically, the extent of their long-term
   movements is not known. Five sharks fitted with satellite transmitters
   showed variable movement patterns. Three sharks remained within the Shark
   Bay region and another made a 500 km round-trip excursion to oceanic
   waters northwest of the bay. These four sharks showed relatively low
   displacement rates relative to sharks tracked over shorter time periods,
   suggesting that sharks move through large home ranges that include Shark
   Bay. Although no reliable position fixes were obtained for the fifth
   shark, we were able to use the timing of satellite uplinks and the
   position of the satellite to determine that it had moved at least 8,000
   km to the coastal waters of southeast Africa in 99 days—the longest
   recorded movement by a tiger shark. This movement and previously
   documented trans-Atlantic movements suggest that tiger shark populations
   may mix across ocean basins and that tiger sharks are subject to
   anthropogenic effects at great distances from protected waters. Finally,
   our method for using single satellite uplinks may be useful in estimating
   movements for wide-ranging species that rarely provide high quality
   location estimates.

AB The bull shark (Carcharhinus leucas) is a widely distributed, large
   coastal shark species known to travel long distances. These
   characteristics, coupled with the species’ long life span and late age of
   maturity, would lead one to predict significant global genetic exchange
   among bull shark populations. By contrast, data show localized depletion
   in some areas of large coastal shark fisheries, indicating some
   geographic isolation may exist. We examined genetic variation in the
   control region of mitochondrial DNA and at five nuclear microsatellite
   loci in bull sharks sampled from the western Atlantic to investigate the
   degree of population subdivision. The average per sample haplotype and
   nucleotide diversity in the mtDNA (0.51 ± 0.26 and 0.12% ± 0.12,
   respectively) and expected heterozygosity (0.84) in the microsatellite
   loci contrast sharply in having lower and higher values (respectively)
   relative to many other shark species. Significant structure exists
   between the Brazilian and all northern populations at the mtDNA control
   region (pairwise ΦST > 0.8, P < 0.001), but not at the nuclear
   microsatellite loci. Adjacent northern populations show weak to no
   genetic differentiation for both markers. These results are congruent
   with restricted maternal gene flow between populations caused by female
   site fidelity to nursery areas. We estimate the current effective
   population size to be around 160,000 and 221,000 individuals for the
   southern and northern Atlantic populations, respectively. The philopatric
   habits and the relatively low levels of mtDNA genetic diversity observed
   in bull sharks must be considered in the conservation of this species.
   Our results indicate that effective bull shark management strategies will
   require local, regional, and international attention and cooperation.

AB Summary Sharks, rays and chimeras (class Chondrichthyes; herein ‘sharks')
   today face possibly the largest crisis of their 420 million year history.
   Tens of millions of sharks are caught and traded internationally each
   year, many populations are overfished to the point where global catch
   peaked in 2003, and a quarter of species have an elevated risk of
   extinction [1–3]. To some, the solution is to simply stop taking them
   from our oceans, or prohibit carriage, sale or trade in shark fins [4].
   Approaches such as bans and alternative livelihoods for fishers (e.g.
   ecotourism) may play some role in controlling fishing mortality but will
   not solve this crisis because sharks are mostly taken as incidental catch
   and play an important role in food security [5–7]. Here, we show that
   moving to sustainable fishing is a feasible solution. In fact,
   approximately 9% of the current global catch of sharks, from at least 33
   species with a wide range of life histories, is biologically sustainable,
   although not necessarily sufficiently managed.

AB Background: A potent angiogenesis inhibitor U-995, has been purified from
   the cartilage of the blue shark (Prionace glauca). U-995 is composed of
   two single peptides with molecular mass of 10 and 14 kDa, respectively.
   Materials and Methods: U-995 was designed to study human umbilical vein
   endothelial cell (HUVEC) migration and proliferation in vitro and
   angiogenesis induced by TNFα in chicken chorioallantoic membrane (CAM).
   Furthermore, we determined the ability of U-995 to inhibiting tumor cell
   growth and metastasis. Results: U-995 (15 and 30 μg/ml) markedly
   inhibited HUVEC migration and, at 15-50 μg/ml produced a dose-dependent
   decline in [ 3 H]-thymidine incorporation. 30 and 50 μg/ml of U-995, when
   added to TNFα-induced angiogenesis caused discontinuous and disrupted
   blood vessels. Moreover U-995 (30 μg/ml) markedly prevented
   collagenase-induced collagenolysis. In addition, when 200μg U-995 was
   injected i.p. into mice it suppressed sarcoma-180 cell growth and B16-F10
   mouse melanoma cell metastasis in vivo. Conclusions: These results
   suggest that the antiangiogenic effects of U-995 may be be due to
   interference with the proliferation and migration of HUVECs as well as
   inhibition of collagenolysis, thereby leading to inhibition of both
   angiogenesis and tumor cell growth.

AB Abstract The bonnethead shark Sphyrna tiburo reproduces by placental
   viviparity with one of the shortest gestation periods (4.5-5 months)
   known in sharks. In southwest Florida, mating in this species occurs in
   November, sperm is stored until ovulation/fertilization the following
   March-April, and parturition occurs in August. Serum concentrations of
   four steroid hormones (17β-estradiol, progesterone, testosterone, and
   dihydrotestosterone) were determined by radioimmunoassay over a complete
   reproductive cycle in mature females from a wild population. Serum
   17β-estradiol and testosterone levels are high during mating and
   preovulatory stages. Preovulatory concentrations of testosterone are
   greater in female S. tiburo than in any other female elasmobranch
   previously studied. Progesterone levels are significantly elevated during
   preovulatory, ovulatory, and postovulatory stages, while serum
   dihydrotestosterone levels increase significantly during the preovulatory
   stage. Our study is the first to demonstrate a sustained rise in
   progesterone during gestation in a placental shark and suggests a
   regulatory role for this hormone during the period prior to implantation
   of the embryos in the uterus.

AB Deviations of total CO,, total alkalinity, and reactive P from
   conservative evaporation lines are used to quantify nonconservative
   fluxes of these materials in a negative estuary; the fluxes arc then
   partitioned among CaCO, prodllction, net community organic carbon
   production, and CO, gas evasion. The rate of organic metabolism for the
   system is controlled by nutrient delivery, although individual
   communities within the system support higher local metabolic rates than
   the bay-wide average by exchange of materials between autotrophic and
   hcterotrophic components. The three CO, flux processes act in concert to
   keep pII and Pcoz relatively constant. Despite the considerable
   understanding of the chemistry of CO, in seawater (summarized by Skirrow
   1975), relatively few investigators have capitalized on CO, flux to
   decipher rates of CaCO, production, organic carbon metabolism, and CO,
   gas flux in specific ecosystems. The investigation by Broecker and
   Takahashi (1966) of the Bahama Banks, studies of various coral reefs
   (Smith 1981; Kinsey 1979; and other papers cited therein), and the study
   by Johnson et al. (1979) of Stuart Channel, British Columbia, are among
   the fairly limited exceptions to this generalization. We develop here
   mass balance calculations for CO, and P flux in Shark Bay, a large

AB We assess the performance of wire leaders, which some jurisdictions have
   banned to reduce shark mortality from pelagic longline fishing.
   Experiments were conducted off northeastern Australia on commercial
   vessels that deployed equal numbers of wire and nylon monofilament
   leaders randomly along their longlines. Catch rates of several species,
   including sharks, were lower on nylon than on wire leaders, probably
   because those animals often escape by biting through the nylon leaders.
   High bite-off rates indicate that as many animals escape from nylon
   leaders as are caught on nylon leaders. The fate of escaped animals is
   not known, although large sharks are more likely to survive than are
   small animals. By contrast, catch rates of valuable bigeye tuna (Thunnus
   obesus) were higher on nylon than on wire leaders. Bigeye tuna are
   probably able to see wire leaders and avoid those hooks. The financial
   benefits of increased bigeye tuna catches outweigh the costs associated
   with banning wire leaders, such as increased rates of gear loss. Thus,
   banning wire leaders is an effective way of reducing shark catches that
   fishers should be keen to adopt.

AB Over the last few decades, much effort has been devoted towards
   quantifying and reducing bycatch in marine fisheries. Of late, there has
   been a particular focus on sharks given that bycatch is a frequently
   listed threat for sharks on the International Union for the Conservation
   of Nature Red List. However, currently there are no quantitative reviews
   or syntheses that explore the issue of shark bycatch globally which is
   problematic given that such a synthesis could inform conservation actions
   and identify pressing research gaps. We performed a qualitative and
   quantitative survey of the peer-reviewed literature to characterize
   trends in shark bycatch research with a particular goal of identifying
   research needs and opportunities. Using a structured literature review we
   identified 103 papers that met our search criteria, with the first one
   published in 1993. Early research efforts focused on documenting the
   scope of bycatch (i.e., determining that sharks were indeed captured as
   bycatch), but more recently there have been increased efforts devoted to
   developing and evaluating bycatch reduction strategies for sharks.
   Research activity was most common in the North Atlantic (~40 % of the
   total articles analysed) with comparatively less research in other areas
   such as the Indo-Pacific region where shark bycatch is regarded as
   particularly common and problematic. Most studies were observational with
   comparatively fewer experimental and modeling studies, and even fewer
   that combined research approaches. Gear modifications (e.g., hook size
   and type for long lines, net size and mesh design for nets) were the most
   commonly evaluated strategy for reducing shark bycatch; however,
   development and use of techniques like repellents, or seasonal area
   closures, or a combination of strategies, offer interesting possibilities
   that require further study. In addition, although many sharks are
   discarded, little is known about post-release survival or sub-lethal
   consequences of fisheries interactions, or evaluations of different fish
   handling strategies, making it difficult to quantify the true cost of
   bycatch or to recommend handling strategies to fishers. Although there
   are some inherent challenges with developing and testing shark bycatch
   reduction strategies, there is an urgent need to do so and this would be
   best achieved through interdisciplinary research that spans field,
   laboratory, and modeling realms.

AB Recreational and commercial fishing effort directed at the shortfin mako
   shark, Isurus oxyrinchus, off the coast of southern California increased
   markedly in the mid 1980s. However, very little is known about the
   population size, stock structure or movements of these sharks in the
   northern Pacific. It is important to determine their role in these waters
   because the southern California bight may be an important pupping and
   nursery area for shortfin mako sharks. Acoustic telemetry was used to
   identify short-term horizontal and vertical movements of three shortfin
   mako sharks in the southern California bight during the summer of 1989.
   All three sharks were two-year-old juveniles and were tracked for periods
   of from 18 to 25 h. They spent 90% of their time in the mixed layer, with
   only infrequent excursions below the thermocline. Vertical and horizontal
   movements did not indicate any diel activity pattern associated with
   distance to the shore or nearby islands or with bottom topography.

AB Abstract Grey nurse sharks off the east coast of Australia are listed
   nationally as “critically endangered” under Schedule 1 of the
   Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act (1999) and may
   number no more than 300 in New South Wales and southern Queensland
   waters. They are an inshore, coastal dwelling species and were severely
   depleted by spearfishing in the 1960s. The population has continued to
   decline despite protection since 1984. Their life history (long-lived to
   25+ years), late maturation (6–8 years), low fecundity (maximum 2 live
   young biennially), specific habitat requirements, limited inshore
   distribution, and small population size render them particularly
   vulnerable to extinction. We estimated the time to quasi-extinction
   (years elapsed for the population to consist of ⩽50 females) for the grey
   nurse shark population off the east coast of Australia based on current
   estimates of abundance and known anthropogenic rates of mortality.
   Estimated minimum population size was 300 as of 2002, and minimum
   anthropogenic mortality assessed from recovered carcasses was 12/year of
   which 75% were females. We modelled time to quasi-extinction using
   deterministic age- and stage-classified models for worst-, likely and
   best-case scenarios. Population size was estimated at 300 (worst), 1000
   (likely) and 3000 (best). Anthropogenic mortality was added to the model
   assuming either all carcasses are being recovered (best), or
   conservatively, that only 50% are reported (realistic). Depending on
   model structure, if all carcasses are being reported, quasi-extinction
   times for worst-, likely and best-case scenarios range from 13 to 16
   years, 84–98 years and 289–324 years, respectively. If under-reporting is
   occurring, time to quasi-extinction ranges from 6 to 8 years, 45–53 years
   and 173–200 years, respectively. In all scenarios modelled the grey nurse
   shark population will decline if no further steps are taken to remove
   anthropogenic sources of mortality. Because estimates of quasi-extinction
   rate depend on initial population size, and sensitivity analysis revealed
   that population rate of change was most sensitive to changes in the
   survival probability of the smallest length classes, obtaining precise
   estimates of abundance and annual survival of young females is critical.

AB The evolutionary transition of fins to limbs involved development of a
   new suite of distal skeletal structures, the digits. During tetrapod limb
   development, genes at the 5′ end of the HoxD cluster are expressed in two
   spatiotemporally distinct phases. In the first phase, Hoxd9-13 are
   activated sequentially and form nested domains along the anteroposterior
   axis of the limb. This initial phase patterns the limb from its proximal
   limit to the middle of the forearm. Later in development, a second wave
   of transcription results in 5′ HoxD gene expression along the distal end
   of the limb bud, which regulates formation of digits. Studies of
   zebrafish fins showed that the second phase of Hox expression does not
   occur, leading to the idea that the origin of digits was driven by
   addition of the distal Hox expression domain in the earliest tetrapods.
   Here we test this hypothesis by investigating Hoxd gene expression during
   paired fin development in the shark Scyliorhinus canicula, a member of
   the most basal lineage of jawed vertebrates. We report that at early
   stages, 5′Hoxd genes are expressed in anteroposteriorly nested patterns,
   consistent with the initial wave of Hoxd transcription in teleost and
   tetrapod paired appendages. Unexpectedly, a second phase of expression
   occurs at later stages of shark fin development, in which Hoxd12 and
   Hoxd13 are re-expressed along the distal margin of the fin buds. This
   second phase is similar to that observed in tetrapod limbs. The results
   indicate that a second, distal phase of Hoxd gene expression is not
   uniquely associated with tetrapod digit development, but is more likely a
   plesiomorphic condition present the common ancestor of chondrichthyans
   and osteichthyans. We propose that a temporal extension, rather than de
   novo activation, of Hoxd expression in the distal part of the fin may
   have led to the evolution of digits.

AB Abstract Gelatin film from blue shark (Prionace glauca) skin was
   investigated in order to utilize what is one of the most serious marine
   wastes in Japan. Film properties from shark skin such as tensile strength
   (TS), elongation at break (EAB) were evaluated. The TS of gelatin film
   from shark skin was affected by the protein concentration (1, 2 and 3%)
   of the film-forming solution (FFS). TS of the film from a 2% protein FFS
   was the highest. EAB and water vapor permeability (WVP) increased with
   increasing FFS protein concentration. WVP of shark skin gelatin was
   evidently low as compared to gelatin films from other fish. An increase
   in the FFS protein concentration decreased transparency at almost all
   wavelengths. Furthermore, opacity at 280 nm was characteristically high
   as compared to films from bony fish skin. The addition of glycerol
   improved flexibility and enhanced the UV barrier property at 280 nm.
   However, transparency at the visible range and WVP increased with
   increasing glycerol content. From the above, it was suggested that shark
   skin gelatin film technology can be applied to pharmaceutical products or
   rich-fat food due to its excellent water and UV barrier properties.

AB In total, 1967 pelagic sharks of eight different species were sampled in
   waters of the Gulf of Guinea between June and August 1993 by commercial
   longline gear. Catches of Prionace glauca and Sphyma zygaena included a
   large number of pregnant females, making it possible to calculate some of
   their reproductive parameters. In total, 419 gravid females of P. glauca
   were caught, ranging in size from 170 to 260 cm fork length. The size at
   which 50% of females have embryos was determined to be 180 cm FL.
   Examination of the uteri from 128 of these females showed a higher number
   of embryos (59-60%) in the right uterus. The mean number of embryos was
   37. Data on embryo size suggests that P. glauca may have a west-east
   migration to give birth along the Atlantic equatorial line. The embryonic
   sex ratio was 1 : 1. In the same catch there were 21 gravid females of S.
   zygaena. No difference in the number of embryos between uteri was found
   in this species. Mean embryo number was 33.5 and embryonic sex ratio was
   1 : 1.

AB Knowledge of how animals move through heterogeneous environments is
   essential to understanding the ecological functions they fulfill in each
   habitat and their responses to environmen- tal change. Upper trophic
   level organisms exert structural influences through the food web, so
   infor- mation on their range, migration and foraging strategy is
   necessary to understanding ecosystem function. Recent technological
   advances have enabled researchers to follow individual animals over
   seasonal and multi-year timescales, revealing long-distance migrations in
   a variety of taxa. We used satellite telemetry to monitor female salmon
   sharks Lamna ditropis and remote sensing to character- ize their
   environment. Salmon sharks ranged throughout the entire eastern North
   Pacific Ocean dur- ing a seasonal migration cycle. During long-distance
   migrations, quantitative movement analyses of speed, path straightness
   and first passage time (FPT) revealed area-restricted search (ARS)
   behaviors in northern and southern regions, with transiting behaviors at
   mid-latitudes. Individuals migrating to a highly productive southern
   region displayed more ARS behaviors than those moving to a low pro-
   ductivity region. The combination of multi-year time-series of animal
   behavior with synoptic environ- mental data reveals factors influencing
   migration and indicates that different life history functions are
   fulfilled in each habitat.

AB article i nfo It is thought that some elasmobranchs use shallow temperate
   estuaries during warmer months because these habitats may provide thermal
   physiological advantages. However, extensive loss and degradation of
   southern California bays and estuaries has reduced coastal species access
   to estuarine habitats. While restoration of southern California estuaries
   has increased over the last two decades, little is known about the
   recovery of ecological function. Top predators are thought to be
   important indicators of restoration of ecological function in many
   ecosystems, including estuarine habitats. In this study, abundance
   surveys and acoustic telemetry were employed to examine how gray
   smooth-hound sharks (GSH) use the newly restored Full Tidal Basin (FTB)
   of Bolsa Chica. GSH were most abundant inside the FTB during the spring
   and summer, and numbers decreased during the winter. Over 83% of all
   individuals (n=336) caught were immature juveniles and were most abundant
   when water temperatures were between 20 and 22 °C. Sharks fitted with
   acoustic transmitters (n=22) were continuously detected for 6-153 days
   (August 2008-December 2009). Forays into coastal waters were uncommon
   until individuals left for the season. GSH selected warmer habitats
   within the middle FTB; however, they also exhibited diel movements along
   the basin. GSH were most often found associated with mud and eelgrass at
   night, presumably for feeding. Since its restoration, population and
   behavioral data suggest that the FTB may provide juvenile GSH with a
   suitable seasonal environment for feeding and growth.

AB Summary The nurse shark was shown to produce antibodies to bovine serum
   albumin detectable by passive hemagglutination. The sera of both normal
   and immunized nurse sharks contained high levels (∼50% of the optical
   density) of immunoglobulins with sedimentation coefficients of
   approximately 19 S and 7 S. These immunoglobulins were isolated and
   purified by diethylaminoethyl cellulose chromatography followed by gel
   filtration on Sephadex G 200. The immunoglobulins were antigenically
   identical when analyzed with rabbit antisera. They also had similar
   immunoelectrophoretic mobilities and hexose contents. Extensive reduction
   and alkylation dissociated both molecules into H (MW ∼70,000) and L (MW
   ∼22,000) polypeptide chains in proportions comparable to IgM. It was
   demonstrated that nurse and lemon sharks had antigenically related
   L-chains and dissimilar H-chains, thus suggesting a differential rate of
   evolutionary changes in immunoglobulin chain structure.

AB The teeth of two different shark species (Isurus oxyrinchus and
   Galeocerdo cuvier) and a geological fluoroapatite single crystal were
   structurally and chemically characterized. In contrast to dentin,
   enameloid showed sharp diffraction peaks which indicated a high
   crystallinity of the enameloid. The lattice parameters of enameloid were
   close to those of the geological fluoroapatite single crystal. The
   inorganic part of shark teeth consisted of fluoroapatite with a fluoride
   content in the enameloid of 3.1 wt.%, i.e., close to the fluoride content
   of the geological fluoroapatite single crystal (3.64 wt.%). Scanning
   electron micrographs showed that the crystals in enameloid were highly
   ordered with a special topological orientation (perpendicular towards the
   outside surface and parallel towards the center). By thermogravimetry,
   water, organic matrix, and biomineral in dentin and enameloid of both
   shark species were determined. Dentin had a higher content of water,
   organic matrix, and carbonate than enameloid but contained less fluoride.
   Nanoindentation and Vicker’s microhardness tests showed that the
   enameloid of the shark teeth was approximately six times harder than the
   dentin. The hardness of shark teeth and human teeth was comparable, both
   for dentin and enamel/enameloid. In contrast, the geological
   fluoroapatite single crystal was much harder than both kinds of teeth due
   to the absence of an organic matrix. In summary, the different biological
   functions of the shark teeth (‘‘tearing’’ for Isurus and ‘‘cutting’’ for
   Galeocerdo) are controlled by the different geometry and not by the
   chemical or crystallographic composition.

AB Although infrequent, shark attacks attract a high level of public and
   media interest, and often have serious consequences for those attacked.
   Data from the Australian Shark Attack File were examined to determine
   trends in unprovoked shark attacks since 1900, particularly over the past
   two decades. The way people use the ocean has changed over time. The rise
   in Australian shark attacks, from an average of 6.5 incidents per yearin
   1990-2000, to 15 incidents per year over the past decade, coincides with
   an increasing human population, more people visiting beaches, a rise in
   the popularity of water-based fitness and recreational activities and
   people accessing previously isolated coastal areas. There is no evidence
   of increasing shark numbers that would influence the rise of attacks in
   Australian waters. The risk of a fatality from shark attack in Australia
   remains low, with an average of 1.1 fatalities year � 1 over the past 20

   consistent with international statistics of shark attacks increasing

AB The sandbar shark, Carcharhinus plumbeus, is a large, cosmopolitan,
   coastal species. Females are thought to show philopatry to nursery
   grounds while males potentially migrate long distances, creating an
   opportunity for male-mediated gene flow that may lead to discordance in
   patterns revealed by mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and nuclear markers. While
   this dynamic has been investigated in elasmobranchs over small spatial
   scales, it has not been examined at a global level. We examined patterns
   of historical phylogeography and contemporary gene flow by genotyping 329
   individuals from nine locations throughout the species’ range at eight
   nuclear microsatellite markers and sequencing the complete mtDNA control
   region. Pairwise comparisons often resulted in fixation indices and
   divergence estimates of greater magnitude using mtDNA sequence data than
   microsatellite data. In addition, multiple methods of estimation
   suggested fewer populations based on microsatellite loci than on mtDNA
   sequence data. Coalescent analyses suggest divergence and restricted
   migration among Hawaii, Taiwan, eastern and western Australia using mtDNA
   sequence data and no divergence and high migration rates, between Taiwan
   and both Australian sites using microsatellite data. Evidence of
   secondary contact was detected between several localities and appears to
   be discreet in time rather than continuous. Collectively, these data
   suggest complex spatial ⁄temporal relationships between shark populations
   that may feature pulses of female dispersal and more continuous
   male-mediated gene flow.

AB The notorious jaws of the white shark Carcharodon carcharias are widely
   feared, yet poorly understood. Neither its bite force, nor how such force
   might be delivered using relatively elastic cartilaginous jaws, have been
   quantified or described. We have digitally reconstructed the jaws of a
   white shark to estimate maximum bite force and examine relationships
   among their three-dimensional geometry, material properties and function.
   We predict that bite force in large white sharks may exceed c. 1.8
   tonnes, the highest known for any living species, and suggest that forces
   may have been an order of magnitude greater still in the gigantic fossil
   species Carcharodon megalodon. However, jaw adductor-generated force in
   Carcharodon appears unremarkable when the predator's body mass is
   considered. Although the shark's cartilaginous jaws undergo considerably
   greater deformation than would jaws constructed of bone, effective bite
   force is not greatly diminished.

AB Abstract Novel molecular data are presented to resolve the long-standing
   issue of the non-monophyly of the elasmobranch-hosted tapeworm order
   Tetraphyllidea relative to the other acetabulate eucestode orders.
   Bayesian inference analyses of various combinations of full ssrDNA, and
   full or partial lsrDNA (D1–D3), sequence data, which included 134 species
   representing 97 genera across the 15 eucestode orders, were conducted.
   New ssrDNA data were generated for 82 species, partial lsrDNA data for 53
   species, and full lsrDNA data for 29 species. The monophyly of each of
   the elasmobranch-hosted orders Cathetocephalidea, Litobothriidea,
   Lecanicephalidea and Rhinebothriidea was confirmed, as was the
   non-monophyly of the Tetraphyllidea. Two relatively stable groups of
   tetraphyllidean taxa emerged and are hereby designated as new orders. The
   Onchoproteocephalidea n. ord. is established to recognise the integrated
   nature of one undescribed and 10 described genera of hook-bearing
   tetraphyllideans, previously placed in the family Onchobothriidae, with
   the members of the order Proteocephalidea. The Phyllobothriidea n. ord.
   is established for a subset of 12 non-hooked genera characterised by
   scoleces bearing four bothridia each with an anterior accessory sucker;
   most parasitise sharks and have been assigned to the Phyllobothriidae at
   one time or another. Tentative ordinal placements are suggested for eight
   additional genera; placements for the remaining tetraphyllidean genera
   have not yet emerged. We propose that these 17 genera remain in the
   “Tetraphyllidea”. Among these, particularly labile across analyses were
   Anthobothrium, Megalonchos, Carpobothrium, Calliobothrium and
   Caulobothrium. The unique association of Chimaerocestus with
   holocephalans, rather than with elasmobranchs, appears to represent a
   host-switching event. Both of the non-elasmobranch hosted clades of
   acetabulate cestodes (i.e. Proteocephalidea and Cyclophyllidea and their
   kin) appear to have had their origins with elasmobranch cestodes. Across
   analyses, the sister group to the clade of “terrestrial” cestode orders
   was found to be an elasmobranch-hosted genus, as was the sister to the
   freshwater fish- and tetrapod-hosted Proteocephalidea. Whilst further
   data are required to resolve outstanding nomenclatural and phylogenetic
   issues, the present analyses contribute significantly to an understanding
   of the evolutionary radiation of the entire Cestoda. Clearly,
   elasmobranch tapeworms comprise the backbone of cestode phylogeny.

AB Shark-inflicted mortality on harbour seals Phoca vitulina on Sable
   Island, Nova Scotia, was studied from 1980 to 1997, based on carcasses
   washed up on shore. During this period, pup production declined
   dramatically from over 600 in 1989 to 40 in 1997. Between 1980 and 1992,
   pup deaths only were recorded, and only during the May‐June pupping
   period, while deaths in all age groups were recorded year-round between
   1993 and 1997; 458 pups, 23 juveniles and 241 adults were found.
   Shark-inflicted mortality in pups, as a proportion of total production,
   was under 10% during 1980‐93, roughly 25% in 1994‐95, and increased to
   45% in 1996. Shark-inflicted mortality occurred in all months except
   December, January and February, with c. 80% of the pups killed during the
   pupping period, and 97% of the adults killed outside the pupping period.
   The decline in pup production was not only a result of reduced
   recruitment owing to pup mortality. A greater proportion of reproductive
   females than males was killed. We estimate that shark-inflicted mortality
   on pups and adult females reduced pup production on Sable Island by 43 to
   154 pups annually between 1993 and 1997. Our results indicate that sharks
   are having an impact on Sable Island harbour seals, possibly to the
   extent of limiting population growth, or contributing to the observed
   population decline. Potential reasons for this increased mortality are
   discussed.

   MBP is 44% similar to mammalian MBP. Both MBPs show conserved

AB The cosmopolitan killer whale Orcinus orca feeds on a wide variety of
   prey types over its global range, but in at least some regions,
   genetically distinct and ecologically specialised lineages of killer
   whales coexist sympatrically. In coastal waters of the northeastern
   Pacific, 2 such lineages have been well described: the so-called
   'residents' prey on teleost fish, especially salmonids and the other
   ('transients') on marine mammals. A third lineage in this region
   ('offshores') appears from chemical tracers to be ecologically distinct
   from residents and transients, but its diet is very poorly known. Here we
   describe 2 encounters with offshore killer whales during which multiple
   predation events involving sharks were observed. Using DNA analysis of
   tissue samples collected from these predation events, we identified the
   prey species as Pacific sleeper shark Somniosus pacificus and determined
   that a minimum of 16 individuals were consumed over the 2 encounters.
   This represents the first confirmed prey species of offshore killer
   whales based on field observations of foraging and the first record of
   any Somniosus species in the prey of Orcinus. We also show quantitatively
   that api- cal tooth wear is far greater in offshores than in resident and
   transient killer whales, and propose that such wear is at least in part
   due to abrasion from dermal denticles embedded in shark skin. Further
   studies are needed to determine whether offshore killer whales are as
   specialised ecologically as resident and transient killer whales, and
   whether sharks play a dominant role in their diet.

AB The present studies demonstrate that matrix Gla protein (MGP), a 10-kDa
   vitamin K-dependent protein, is phosphorylated at 3 serine residues near
   its N-terminus. Phosphoserine was identified at residues 3, 6, and 9 of
   bovine, human, rat, and lamb MGP by N-terminal protein sequencing. All 3
   modified serines are in tandemly repeated Ser-X-Glu sequences. Two of the
   serines phosphorylated in shark MGP, residues 2 and 5, also have
   glutamate residues in the n + 2 position in tandemly repeated Ser-X-Glu
   sequences, whereas the third, shark residue 3, would acquire an acidic
   phosphoserine in the n + 2 position upon phosphorylation of serine 5. The
   recognition motif found for MGP phosphorylation, Ser-X-Glu/Ser(P), has
   been seen previously in milk caseins, salivary proteins, and a number of
   regulatory peptides. A review of the literature has revealed an
   intriguing dichotomy in the extent of serine phosphorylation among
   secreted proteins that are phosphorylated at Ser-X-Glu/Ser(P) sequences.
   Those phosphoproteins secreted into milk or saliva are fully
   phosphorylated at each target serine, whereas phosphoproteins secreted
   into the extracellular environment of cells are partially phosphorylated
   at target serine residues, as we show here for MGP and others have shown
   for regulatory peptides and the insulin-like growth factor binding
   protein 1. We propose that the extent of serine phosphorylation regulates
   the activity of proteins secreted into the extracellular environment of
   cells, and that partial phosphorylation can therefore be explained by the
   need to ensure that the phosphoprotein be poised to gain or lose activity
   with regulated changes in phosphorylation status.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT

AB Abstract: The taxonomic origin of the white shark, Carcharodon, is a
   highly debated subject. New fossil evidence presented in this study
   suggests that the genus is derived from the broad-toothed ‘mako’,
   Carcharodon (Cosmopolitodus) hastalis, and includes the new species C.
   hubbelli sp. nov. – a taxon that demonstrates a transition between C.
   hastalis and Carcharodon carcharias. Specimens from the Pisco Formation
   clearly demonstrate an evolutionary mosaic of characters of both recent
   C. carcharias and fossil C. hastalis. Characters diagnostic to C.
   carcharias include the presence tooth serrations and a symmetrical first
   upper anterior tooth that is the largest in the tooth row, while those
   indicative of C. hastalis include a mesially slanted third anterior
   (intermediate) tooth. We also provide a recalibration of critical fossil
   horizons within the Pisco Formation, Peru using zircon U-Pb dating and
   strontium-ratio isotopic analysis. The recalibration of the absolute
   dates suggests that Carcharodon hubbelli sp. nov. is Late Miocene (6–8
   Ma) in age. This research revises and elucidates lamnid shark evolution
   based on the calibration of the Neogene Pisco Formation.

AB Little is known about the reproductive strategies and mating behaviour of
   most sharks. Understanding mating behaviour is important as it can
   determine reproductive success and possibly rates of multiple paternity
   and fecundity. Additionally, some sharks appear to have specific habitat
   requirements for mating activities. We tested the utility of a
   3-dimensional acceleration logger to identify mating events in
   free-living nurse sharks Ginglymostoma cirratum in an area where behav-
   iours can be observed directly, thus allowing corroboration of
   acceleration data. Loggers were attached to 4 adult females and were
   recovered after recording periods of 23.2 to 99.8 h (mean ± SD = 50.0 ±
   35.1 h). We used acceleration data to classify several behaviours,
   including swimming, rest- ing, resting in a surge zone, and mating, with
   examples of each behaviour confirmed via direct obser- vation. Twenty-six
   mating events were inferred from acceleration data, ranging from 21 s to
   20.1 min in duration (median = 2.22 min), with no events taking place
   during the nighttime hours between 23:00 and 07:00 h. Four events lasted
   longer than 9 min and took place during periods when logger- equipped
   sharks were not acoustically detected within the shallow study site. The
   similarity in mat- ing behaviours between this and some other species
   raises the possibility that accelerometry could be used to quantify
   mating in a variety of shark species. This is the first study to classify
   mating and other behaviours in free-living sharks from acceleration data.

   whitetip reef (16–29%) and blacktip reef (6–13%) sharks. Logbook data
   revealed spatially and temporally variable landings of shark from the
   GBR. Catch per unit effort (CPUE) through time was stable for the period
   from 1989 to 2006 with no evidence of increase or decline. Data from
   observer and ELF data sets indicated no differences in CPUE among
   regions. The ELF data set demonstrated that CPUE was higher in Marine

   to fishing). The ongoing and consistent catches of reef sharks in the
   fishery and effectiveness of no-fishing zones suggest that management
   zones within the GBR Marine Park are effective at protecting a portion of

AB Quantifying shark distribution patterns and species-specific habitat
   associations in response to geographic and environmental drivers is
   critical to assessing risk of exposure to fishing, habitat degradation,
   and the effects of climate change. The present study examined shark
   distribution patterns, species-habitat associations, and marine reserve
   use with baited remote underwater video stations (BRUVS) along the entire
   Great Barrier Reef Marine Park (GBRMP) over a ten year period. Overall,
   21 species of sharks from five families and two orders were recorded.
   Grey reef Carcharhinus amblyrhynchos, silvertip C. albimarginatus, tiger
   Galeocerdo cuvier, and sliteye Loxodon macrorhinus sharks were the most
   abundant species (>64% of shark abundances). Multivariate regression
   trees showed that hard coral cover produced the primary split separating
   shark assemblages. Four indicator species had consistently higher
   abundances and contributed to explaining most of the differences in shark
   assemblages: C. amblyrhynchos, C. albimarginatus, G. cuvier, and whitetip
   reef Triaenodon obesus sharks. Relative distance along the GBRMP had the
   greatest influence on shark occurrence and species richness, which
   increased at both ends of the sampling range (southern and northern
   sites) relative to intermediate latitudes. Hard coral cover and distance
   across the shelf were also important predictors of shark distribution.
   The relative abundance of sharks was significantly higher in non-fished
   sites, highlighting the conservation value and benefits of the GBRMP
   zoning. However, our results also showed that hard coral cover had a
   large effect on the abundance of reef-associated shark species,
   indicating that coral reef health may be important for the success of
   marine protected areas. Therefore, understanding shark distribution
   patterns, species-habitat associations, and the drivers responsible for
   those patterns is essential for developing sound management and
   conservation approaches.

AB Abstract Wildlife provisioning, i.e. the provision of bait to generate
   aggregations of charismatic megafauna as tourist attractions, occurs
   around the world. This practice is often promoted as an economic
   incentive to conserve the focal species, yet has stimulated debate based
   on the potential for risks to human safety and perceptions of behavioural
   shifts in provisioned populations. We studied a population of Caribbean
   reef sharks ( Carcharhinus perezi ) in the Bahamas that has been subject
   to regular provisioning for >20 years. We used a combination of focal
   observations of sharks during feeding events, remote acoustic telemetry
   and stable isotope analysis of shark muscle tissue to determine the
   impacts of provisioning on the trophic signatures and ranging behaviour
   of sharks in this population. A small number of large sharks monopolised
   more than 50% of the bait on offer. These ‘fed’ individuals showed
   significant 15 N enrichment in their tissues compared to conspecifics of
   the same size that failed to obtain bait at the feeding site, and
   un-provisioned sharks from a control site. Despite the disparity in
   trophic signatures, fed, unfed and control sharks exhibited similar
   degrees of residency at their respective home receiver sites, and
   travelled similar daily minimum distances. Thus, despite long-term
   provisioning of this Caribbean reef shark population, there is no
   evidence for shifts in the behaviours considered which might affect the
   ecological role of these sharks. However, further research is required to
   examine potential indirect effects of shark provisioning on sympatric
   fauna and habitat before this activity can be placed within a sustainable
   marine conservation framework.

AB Abstract The shark control programs of New South Wales (NSW), Queensland
   and KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) are compared in an attempt to determine whether
   the fishing effort applied in the KZN program could be reduced. The
   stated mechanism in all three programs is to reduce shark numbers, and
   thereby the probability of an encounter between a shark and a bather.
   Large-mesh ( 50–60 cm stretched) gill nets are used in each program, and
   in Queensland these are supplemented by baited drumlines. The number of
   standard ( 100 m net) net-days per protected (meshed) bathing area per
   month is about 26 in NSW, 57 in Queensland and 192 in KZN. There is a
   four-month closed season (i.e. no control measures) in winter in NSW, a
   six-week closed season at some Queensland beaches and no closed season in
   KZN. Despite these differences, the apparent successes of the programs in
   reducing the total number of shark attacks recorded at meshed beaches are
   impressive and comparable. The same shark species are believed to have
   been responsible for most of the attacks in the three regions, these
   being the great white shark Carcharodon carcharias , the bull shark
   Carcharhinus leucas and the tiger shark Galeocerdo cuvier . After
   comparing factors such as the nearshore physical environment and trends
   in shark catch and catch rate, it is concluded that there is a case for
   reducing the number of nets in KZN.

AB The New South Wales (NSW) government has operated a program of netting
   beaches for the protection of swimmers and surfers against shark attack
   since 1937 in Sydney, and since 1949 in Newcastle and Wollongong. The
   scope and directives of the Shark Meshing Program have remained constant
   since its inception, with operational modifications in net specifications
   in 1972, changes in spatial deployment in 1972, 1987 and 1992, and the
   elimination of winter netting since 1989. This markedly increased meshing
   effort in 1972, and again in 1987. In the present study, we examine the
   trends in catch and effort for the period from 1950–1951 to 2009–2010
   over this 200-km section of the NSW coast. Significant temporal trends in
   species, size and sex composition are described herein. Catches were
   consistently dominated by three shark taxa, hammerhead sharks (Sphyrna
   spp.), whaler sharks (Carcharhinus spp.) and Australian angel sharks
   (Squatina australis), although their relative contributions to catches
   varied over time. Catch per unit effort has significantly declined for
   five of the most abundant shark taxa over the study period, increasing
   only for a single taxon, the sevengill shark (Notorynchus cepedianus).
   Catches of larger, potentially dangerous white sharks (Carcharodon
   carcharias) and tiger sharks (Galeocerdo cuvier) saw fewer large animals
   being caught over time. This pattern was not observed across other taxa.
   Four different monthly trends were observed in landings of the most
   abundant eight taxa, reflecting differences in the biology of the catch
   species. The current study also provides useful information on catches
   and sizes of grey nurse (Carcharias taurus) and white sharks before and
   after their protection in NSW waters in 1984 and 1998, respectively.

AB Archival tags were used to study the movement and depth behaviour of
   school sharks, Galeorhinus galeus, in southern australia. Thirty fish
   were tagged in late 1997, and to date there have been nine recaptures
   (30% recapture rate). Periods at liberty varied from 8 days to 18 months.
   The sharks spent about 80% of their time on the continental shelf, and
   appeared to swim close to the bottom during the day. At night they often
   ascended for periods of up to several hours, except at times around the
   full moon. When in deep water, the sharks typically descended at dawn to
   depths of up to 600 m, before ascending at dusk. It was not possible to
   use the light data from the tags to estimate position when the sharks
   were in deep water, because they were often at depths beyond the
   sensitivity of the tag. In shallower water, longitude was estimated from
   the light data but latitude was estimated from the maximum daily depth,
   assuming the fish were on the bottom. The timing of the dives in
   deepwater appeared sufficiently regular to offer the prospect of using it
   to estimate longitude. We propose future research using archival tags on
   this species should address questions about female reproductive
   migrations, pelagic behaviour and vertical movements.

AB : The cells of origin of pathways descending to the spinal cord in the
   shark Scyliorhinus canicula and in the ray Raja clavata have been
   demonstrated by using the horseradish peroxidase (HRP) technique.
   Following HRP injections in the spinal cord of Scyliorhinus (fourth to
   sixth segment) and of Raja (15th to 20th segment) labeled neurons could
   be identified in the rhombencephalon, the mesencephalon, and in the
   diencephalon. Cells of origin of diencephalic nuclei, which project to
   the spinal cord, were observed in the nucleus periventricularis
   hypothalami and in the thalamus ventralis pars medialis which can in this
   respect be considered hypothalamic. Descending pathways from
   mesencephalic structures originate from the interstitial nucleus of the
   fasciculus longitudinalis medialis, the tectum mesencephali, the nucleus
   intercollicularis, the tectotegmental junction zone, and from diffusely
   arranged tegmental neurons. A contralateral rubrospinal pathway could be
   recognized in Raja, but not in Scyliorhinus. Rhombencephalic cells of
   origin of pathways descending to the spinal cord were found in all parts
   of the reticular formation, i.e., the nucleus raphes inferior, the
   nucleus reticularis inferior, medius, superior, and isthmi, in two
   vestibular nuclei, and in three nuclei, which have been tentatively
   indicated as nucleus B, F, and G. Furthermore cells of origin of
   descending pathways have been found in the nucleus tractus descendens
   nervi trigemini, in the nucleus funiculi lateralis, and in the nucleus
   tractus solitarii. The descending pathways of the two species studied
   have been compared with those of other vertebrates. It is concluded that
   the basic pattern in the organization of descending pathways to the
   spinal cord, as proposed by ten Donkelaar ('76) for terrestrial
   vertebrates, also holds for cartilaginous fishes.

AB We estimate recent (1992–2005) trends in relative abundance for Northwest
   Atlantic oceanic and large coastal sharks, using generalized linear mixed
   models to standardize catch rates of eight species groups as recorded by
   U.S. pelagic longline fishery observers. Models suggest precipitous (76%)
   declines in hammerhead (Sphyrna species) and large coastal (dusky, night,
   and silky shark, genus Carcharhinus) species, and moderate declines (53%)
   in blue and oceanic whitetip sharks over this period. In contrast, mako
   and thresher sharks appear to have stabilized, and the tiger shark
   population appears to be increasing. A comparison of nominal shark catch
   rates from this fleet’s observer and logbook data (to evaluate the
   veracity of trends previously estimated from the latter) showed a high
   degree of concordance for each species group, both in individual
   sub-areas and overall. Models of these two datasets for the common time
   period (1992–2000) show that compared to the observer data the logbook
   data indicate greater declines for some species, but lesser declines for
   others. Signs of recovery for some shark species are encouraging, but
   must also be set in the context of the significant declines that occurred
   in previous decades.

AB Age-length data were derived from counting stained bands on whole

   captured by gill-nets during 1973-76 in Bass Strait and from gummy shark
   and school shark, Galeorhinus galeus, captured during 1986-87 in Bass
   Strait and waters off South Australia. The data were fitted to the von
   Bertalanffy growth equation after adopting the Francis reparametrization
   and correcting for sampling bias caused by the selectivity effects of the
   gill-nets of various mesh sizes used to capture the sharks. The von
   Bertalanffy growth curves of male and female gummy shark were
   significantly different, but the growth curves of male and female school
   shark were not. The growth curves suggest that growth rates of male and
   female gummy shark in Bass Strait were lower during 1986-87 than during
   1973-76 and that the growth rates of male and female gummy shark and
   school shark in Bass Strait during 1986-87 were lower than those in South
   Australia at the same time. These apparent temporal and spatial
   differences in growth patterns of gummy shark are explained by the
   'Phenomenon of Apparent Change in Growth Rate'. It is concluded that the
   growth curves determined for 1986-87 are distorted by the effects of a
   long history of high and length-selective fishing mortality and that
   actual growth patterns of gummy shark are better represented by the von
   Bertalanffy growth equation determined for shark caught in Bass Strait
   during 1973-76, when fishing mortality was much lower. Verification of
   age estimates was attempted by comparing von Bertalanffy growth curves
   derived from age-length data with those derived from tag
   release-recapture length-increment data, but these comparisons highlight
   the limitations of using tag data for this purpose. Although reasonable
   agreement was found between such growth curves for gummy shark, it
   appears that school shark older than 11 years cannot be aged accurately
   from stained whole or sectioned vertebrae. Sectioned vertebrae from a
   school shark recaptured 35.7 years after being tagged and released and
   calculated as having an age exceeding 45 years gave estimates of only
   18-20 years of age.

   Framework, in particular, a shift in the industry towards the mainstream
   from the periphery. In comparison with the past, whale shark tourism at
   Ningaloo now attracts more generalist tourists who place different
   preferences on the whale shark tourism experience. There is now a greater
   distribution of age groups; less skilled individuals; a higher tolerance
   to crowding; and a larger focus on the non-wildlife components of the
   experience. Furthermore, this article, discusses the pertinent management
   implications associated with this shift.

AB The nurse shark is an extremely abundant shallow water species in Florida
   and the Caribbean, yet its biology is poorly known. Moreover, there is a
   great deal of misinformation about it in the literature. The maximum size
   and weight attained by the nurse shark have often been exaggerated. None
   of the specimens measured in this study exceeded 265 cm TL and 114.5 kg,
   and none of the specimens actually measured by other researchers exceeded
   280 cm. Females reach maturity at a length of 223–231 cm, or at 86% of
   their maximum size. Males reach maturity between 214 and 214.6 cm in
   length or at about 83% of their maximum size. Mating primarily occurs
   from mid-June to early July. The embryos are enclosed in sturdy egg
   capsules for the first 12–14 weeks of gestation. In a gravid female, the
   embryos are at different stages of development during the first four
   months of gestation. Embryos are lecithotrophic and there is no evidence
   of any supplemental mode of embryonic nourishment. Embryos measure
   28–30.5 cm at birth. The gestation period is estimated at about five to
   six months. Brood sizes are large, ranging from 21 to 50 young, with a
   median of 34 young. The reproductive cycle of the nurse shark consists of
   a five to six-month gestation period and a two-year ovarian cycle. Thus,
   the reproductive cycle is biennial and a female produces a brood every
   two years. The nurse shark is an opportunistic predator that consumes a
   wide range of small fishes, primarily grunts (Haemulidae).

AB Abstract Generalized additive model (GAM) and regression tree analyses
   were conducted with blue shark, Prionace glauca , catch rates (catch per
   set) as reported by National Marine Fisheries Service observers serving
   aboard Hawaii-based commercial longline vessels from March 1994 through
   December 1997 ( N =2010 longline sets). The objective was to use GAM and
   regression tree methodology to relate catch rates to a tractable suite of
   readily measured or computed variables. Because the predictor variables
   are also either provided in or easily computed from the logbooks that
   commercial vessels submit upon landing fish for sale, it is likely that a
   model or models fitted to accurate observer data could then be applied on
   a fleet-wide basis to serve as a standard of comparison for the logbooks.
   The GAM included nine spatio-temporal, environmental, and operational
   variables and explained 72.1% of the deviance of blue shark catch rates.
   Latitude exerted the strongest effects of any individual variable;
   longitude was the most influential variable when adjusted for the effects
   of all other factors. Relatively cold sea surface temperatures were
   associated with high catch rates. The initial regression tree included 68
   terminal nodes and 11 predictors. It was refined to a final tree with 42
   terminal nodes, which reduced the root mean deviance by 65.3%. The tree
   was partitioned first on latitude 26.6°N, and then branched out to reach
   terminal nodes after 2–8 additional partitionings. Sets south of this
   latitude were characterized by lower catch rates and partitionings on a
   greater number and variety of predictors. Northerly sets were
   characterized by higher and more variable blue shark catch rates.
   Predictions from the two analyses were highly correlated ( r =0.903, P
   ⪡0.001). Moreover, use of these methods in combination aided greatly in
   the interpretation of results. We conclude that GAM and regression tree
   analyses can be usefully employed in the assessment of blue shark catch
   rates in this fishery. We suggest that either or both of these models
   could serve as comparison standards for commercial logbooks.

AB Abstract Leopard shark triacylglycerol lipase has been characterized as a
   crude pancreatic preparation. The enzyme demonstrated an absolute
   requirement for trihydroxy bile salts for activity with natural bile
   salts of the shark giving a 4-fold greater stimulation of activity than
   pure sodium taurocholate. Bile salts also protected the enzyme from
   apparent inactivation by p -chloromercuribenzoate and trypsin treatment.
   The shark lipase demonstrated a temperature optimum of 36° C and was
   rapidly inactivated at 50° C even in the presence of bile salts. Divalent
   metal ions were required for activity with Ca 2+ providing the greatest
   stimulation. At 22° C, pH 8.5 and in the presence of natural bile salts,
   the apparent V was about 0.6 μmol fatty acid released/min per mg protein.
   The shark enzyme hydrolyzed over 90% of the fatty acids from
   trioleoylglycerol and methyl esters of pancreatic lipase-resistant fatty
   acids were hydrolyzed at the same rate as typical fatty acid methyl
   esters. Hydrolysis of triacylglycerol proceeded about ten-times faster
   than wax ester hydrolysis. The kinetic properties of the leopard shark
   enzyme were compared to other bile salt-dependent lipolytic enzymes.
   Pancreatic lipase activity was not dectected.

   observe and record the attraction of free-ranging sharks to a nearby

   or consisting of octave bands of noise. Irregularly pulsed, pure tones
   and harmonic sounds above 1000 Hz were apparently not attractive.
   Attraction was not reinforced, and habituation of the approach response
   was regularly observed in prolonged test series. As the number of sharks
   in the test area increased, swimming activity rose dramatically. Circling
   and crisscrossing of the site became more intense under conditions of low

AB Abstract Fisheries targeting elasmobranch resources have experienced a
   dramatic growth during the past two decades. World-wide elasmobranch
   landings exceed 600 000 metric tons (mt) annually and have clearly made a
   significant impact on portions of that resource. In the eastern north
   Pacific catches of common thresher, shortfin mako and blue sharks may
   exceed 15 000 mt annually. Nearly 90% of all sharks taken within this
   area are immature. Like most sharks, these pelagics have low rates of
   increase which make them quite vulnerable to modern day fishing pressure.
   Clearly, the removal of large segments of juveniles from any population
   has the potential to decrease the adult population to unsustainable
   levels. The ability of populations to recover from over-exploitation
   depends not only on initial stock size, natural mortality, and migration
   rates, but also upon reducing total fishing mortality. Regulations
   enacted by special interest groups benefiting only one segment of the
   resource users, combined with the lack of biological information, have
   slowed progress towards achieving rational management.

AB The tail of most sharks has an elongated upper lobe that differs from the
   externally symmetrical tail structure common among bony fishes, but the
   hydrodynamic purpose of this asymmetric tail shape is unclear1,2,3. Here
   we quantify water flow patterns in the wakes of freely swimming dogfish
   sharks and find that they have a ring-within-a-ring vortex structure, in
   contrast to the single rings shed by symmetrical fish tails. The
   branched-ring vortex is generated by the inclined angle of the tail's
   trailing edge and by its motion at an angle to the horizontal body axis;
   the vortex directs water backwards and downwards, which may increase the
   shark's vertical manoeuvrability.

AB Interactions between large marine predators and their prey are difficult
   to observe and little is known about the risk of predation faced by sea
   turtles. The frequency of predator-inflicted injuries, however, has
   afforded insights into the predation risk faced by many taxa. We measured
   the frequency of shark-inflicted injuries on green (Chelonia mydas) and
   loggerhead (Caretta caretta) sea turtles in Shark Bay, Western Australia
   with a view to determiningdifferences between species and sex-classes in
   the risk of predation from tiger sharks (Galeocerdo cuvier). Furthermore,
   we investigated how escape ability and habitat use might influence the
   probability of turtles beinginjured by sharks. Shark-inflicted injuries
   were more frequent on loggerhead than on green turtles, and most frequent
   on adult male loggerhead turtles. Species effects could not be attributed
   to differences in habitat use, since green turtles were found in habitats
   favored by tiger sharks more often than were loggerhead turtles. Green
   turtles, however, were faster and maneuvered better than loggerhead
   turtles, suggesting that escape ability is a factor in interspecific
   differences in injury frequency. The sex-class difference in injury
   frequency of loggerhead turtles suggests that males face greater
   predation risk than females and may take more risks. For green turtles,
   the lack of a sex difference in injury frequency might be due to greater
   escape ability lowering overall predation risk or to no differences
   between sexes in the benefits of risk-taking.

AB Transepithelial Cl- secretion in vertebrates is accomplished by a
   secondary active transport process brought about by the coordinated
   activity of apical and basolateral transport proteins. The principal
   basolateral components are the Na+/K(+)-ATPase pump, the Na+/K+/2Cl-
   cotransporter (symporter) and a K+ channel. The rate-limiting apical
   component is a cyclic-AMP-stimulated Cl- channel. As postulated nearly
   two decades ago, the net Cl- movement from the blood to the lumen
   involves entry into the epithelial cells with Na+ and K+, followed by
   active Na+ extrusion via the pump and passive K+ exit via a channel.
   Intracellular [Cl-] is raised above electrochemical equilibrium and exits
   into the lumen when the apical Cl- channel opens. Cl- secretion is
   accompanied by a passive paracellular flow of Na+. The tubules of the
   rectal glands of elasmobranchs are highly specialized for secreting
   concentrated NaCl by this mechanism and hence have served as an excellent
   experimental model in which to characterize the individual steps by
   electrophysiological and ion flux measurements. The recent molecular
   cloning and heterologous expression of the apical Cl- channel and
   basolateral cotransporter have enabled more detailed analyses of the
   mechanisms and their regulation. Not surprisingly, since hormones acting
   through kinases control secretion, both the Cl- channel, which is the
   shark counterpart of the CFTR (Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance
   Regulator), and the cotransporter are regulated by phosphorylation and
   dephosphorylation. The primary stimulation of secretion by hormones
   employing cyclic AMP as second messenger activates CFTR via the direct
   action of protein kinase A (PKA), which phosphorylates multiple sites on
   the R domain. In contrast, phosphorylation of the cotransporter by as yet
   unidentified kinases is apparently secondary to the decrease in
   intracellular chloride concentration caused by anion exit through CFTR.

AB Acoustic telemetry was used to identify the short-term horizontal and
   vertical movement patterns of the bigeye thresher shark Alopias
   superciliosus in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean dur- ing the summer
   of 1996. Two immature female sharks, 175 and 124 cm PCL (precaudal
   length), were tracked for 96 and 70 h, respectively, demonstrating very
   distinct crepuscular vertical migrations sim- ilar to those reported for
   the megamouth shark. The bigeye threshers stayed at 200 to 500 m depth
   during the day and at 80 to 130 m at night. The deepest dive extends the
   known depth distribution of the species to 723 m. No 'fly-glide' behavior
   (rapid ascents followed by slower acute-angled descents) was observed for
   the 2 sharks. However, the opposite behavioral pattern of slow ascents
   and rela- tively rapid descents during the night was observed. Since
   bigeye threshers have large eyes extend- ing upwards onto the dorsal
   surface of the cranium, it may be more efficient for them to hunt prey
   which are highlighted against the sea surface from below. Estimated mean
   swimming speed over the ground ranged from 1.32 to 2.02 km h -1 , similar
   to swordfish and megamouth sharks, and slower than that reported for
   tunas, billfishes, and other pelagic sharks.

AB Sharks express an unusual heavy-chain isotype called IgNAR, whose
   variable regions bind antigen as independent soluble domains. To further
   probe affinity maturation of the IgNAR response, we structurally
   characterized the germline and somatically matured versions of a type II
   variable (V) region, both in the presence and absence of its antigen, hen
   egg-white lysozyme. Despite a disulfide bond linking complementarity
   determining regions (CDRs) 1 and 3, both germline and somatically matured
   V regions displayed significant structural changes in these CDRs upon
   complex formation with antigen. Somatic mutations in the IgNAR V region
   serve to increase the number of contacts with antigen, as reflected by a
   tenfold increase in affinity, and one of these mutations appears to
   stabilize the CDR3 region. In addition, a residue in the HV4 loop plays
   an important role in antibody-antigen interaction, consistent with the
   high rate of somatic mutations in this non-CDR loop.

AB The white shark, Carcharodon carcharias, has a complex life history that
   is characterized by large scale movements and a highly variable diet.
   Estimates of age and growth for the white shark from the eastern North
   Pacific Ocean indicate they have a slow growth rate and a relatively high
   longevity. Age, growth, and longevity estimates useful for stock
   assessment and fishery models, however, require some form of validation.
   By counting vertebral growth band pairs, ages can be estimated, but
   because not all sharks deposit annual growth bands and many are not
   easily discernable, it is necessary to validate growth band periodicity
   with an independent method. Radiocarbon (14C) age validation uses the
   discrete 14C signal produced from thermonuclear testing in the 1950s and
   1960s that is retained in skeletal structures as a time-specific marker.
   Growth band pairs in vertebrae, estimated as annual and spanning the
   1930s to 1990s, were analyzed for Δ14C and stable carbon and nitrogen
   isotopes (δ13C and δ15N). The aim of this study was to evaluate the
   utility of 14C age validation for a wide-ranging species with a complex
   life history and to use stable isotope measurements in vertebrae as a
   means of resolving complexity introduced into the 14C chronology by
   ontogenetic shifts in diet and habitat. Stable isotopes provided useful
   trophic position information; however, validation of age estimates was
   confounded by what may have been some combination of the dietary source
   of carbon to the vertebrae, large-scale movement patterns, and steep 14C
   gradients with depth in the eastern North Pacific Ocean.

AB Abstract The effects of circle hooks on blue shark Prionace glauca catch
   in a pelagic longline fishery were assessed in fishing experiments on two
   research vessels in the western North Pacific off the coast of Japan from
   May to September 2005. We used conventional tuna hooks (standard Japanese
   hook size; 3.8 sun) and two sizes of circle hooks (4.3 sun and 5.2 sun)
   for each fishing operation and compared catch rates, size compositions
   and mortalities of blue shark between hooks. One vessel used stainless
   steel wire leaders and the other vessel used nylon-monofilament leaders.
   Total numbers of blue shark caught were 755 and 2598 for the respective
   vessels. Mean catch rates (per 1000 hooks) of blue shark for the 3.8 sun
   tuna hook, the 4.3 sun circle hook and the 5.2 sun circle hook were 40.5,
   37.9 and 36.1, respectively, for one vessel, and 81.6, 95.2 and 93.9,
   respectively, for the other. Catch rates did not differ significantly
   between the three hook types on either vessel ( P = 0.48 and 0.43,
   two-way ANOVA). Proportions of dead individuals for the 3.8 sun tuna
   hook, the 4.3 sun circle hook and the 5.2 sun circle hook were 0.03, 0.02
   and 0.05, respectively, for one vessel, and 0.10, 0.11 and 0.11,
   respectively, for the other. The proportion of dead individuals was not
   significantly different between the three hook types on either vessel ( P
   = 0.31 and 0.70, χ 2 -test of independence). Mean estimated pre-caudal
   lengths of blue shark caught by each hook type were between 133 and 135
   cm for one vessel and 193 and 194 cm for the other. The difference in
   mean length between hook types was insignificant for one vessel, but
   significant for the other ( P = 1.00 and 0.03, ANOVA). These results
   indicate that the circle hooks used in this study had little impact on
   catch rate and mortality of blue shark. We also discuss the possible
   relationships between hook type, leader material, hooking location, and
   catch rate of sharks.

AB Ontogenetic diet shifts are a widespread phenomenon among vertebrates,
   although their relationships with life history traits are poorly known.
   We analyzed the relative importance of body size, age and maturity stage
   as determinants of the diet of a marine top predator, the copper shark,
   Carcharhinus brachyurus, by examining stomach contents using a
   multiple-hypothesis modeling approach. Copper sharks shifted their diet
   as size and age increased and as they became sexually mature,
   incorporated larger prey as they grew, and had a discrete shift in diet
   with body size, with only individuals larger than ≈200 cm total length
   able to prey on chondrichthyans. Body size was the most important trait
   explaining the consumption of chondrichthyans, while age determined the
   consumption of pelagic teleosts. Pelagic teleosts were consumed mostly by
   medium-aged sharks, a result, probably, of a risk-reducing feeding
   strategy at young ages coupled with either a senescence-related decline
   in performance or a change in sensory capabilities as sharks age. Copper
   sharks of all sizes were able to cut prey in pieces, implying that gape
   limitation (i.e., the impossibility of eating prey larger than a
   predator’s mouth) did not play a role in producing the diet shift. Our
   results suggest that, contrary to the current practice of setting minimum
   but not maximum size limits in catches, any plan to conserve or restore
   the ecological function of sharks, through their predatory control of
   large prey, should aim to maintain the largest individuals.

   reef sharks is im- portant to understand their role in reef communities
   and to aid the design of conservation strategies for this predatory
   guild. We observed 4 species of reef sharks aggregating in an inshore bay
   in the north of Western Australia for over 2 yr, using acoustic telemetry
   and visual censuses to examine how they par- titioned this site in space
   and time. We fitted 58 sharks with acoustic transmitters: Carcharhinus
   melanopterus (36), C. amblyrhynchos (11), Negaprion acutidens (7) and
   Triaenodon obesus (4). Aggre- gations consisted primarily of C.
   melanopterus, although C. amblyrhynchos and N. acu tidens were of- ten
   present. We observed aggregations by visual census in summer (maximum of
   44 sharks). Detec- tions were highest during warmer months (Sep to Mar)
   for all species, although some individuals showed year-round residency.
   C. melanopterus, C. amblyrhynchos and N. acutidens had strong diel
   patterns of attendance at the aggregation site. Peak daily detections
   occurred from 13:00 to 14:00 h local time for C. melanopterus and C.
   amblyrhynchos; juvenile C. melanopterus and N. acutidens peaked at 05:00
   and 10:00 h, respectively. There was considerable spatial overlap of core
   areas of use (50% kernel density estimates) at the northern end of the
   bay by all species; the southern end was used primarily by C.
   melanopterus and N. acutidens. Aggregations of C. mela nop terus and C.
   am- blyrhynchos consisted mainly of adult females, some of them pregnant.
   Courtship behaviour in C. melanopterus and T. obesus suggests that these
   aggregations are related to reproduction. All species displayed
   inter-annual site fidelity. The long-term presence of juvenile C.
   melanopterus and N. acuti- dens also suggests that this bay provides
   suitable conditions for younger age classes.

AB This study analyses the sexual activity and segregation of sand tiger
   sharks, Carcharias taurus, from Anegada Bay (Argentina).
   Reproduction-linked movements along the South American Atlantic coast
   were inferred from data from several SW Atlantic localities. Male sand
   tigers (n=162) matured at 193 cm total length (L T ). Females (n=77)
   matured between 218 and 235 cm L T . These figures are similar to those
   from other populations, although size-at-maturity of males was slightly
   different from South African and Australian populations. In females, the
   size of ovarian follicles was positively correlated with gonadosomatic
   index and negatively correlated with hepatosomatic index, while the liver
   was significantly larger than in males. Sand tiger sharks were present in
   Anegada Bay from December to April. Males were significantly more
   abundant than females (2:1). Significant differences in reproductive
   condition through time were observed in males. During January and
   February males had seminal vesicles full of spermatozeugmata but by March
   and April the vesicles were empty. As the proportion of males with a
   lighter colouration peaked from January to March, it is very likely that
   mating takes place during January and February. The skewed sex-ratio
   during the mating season indicates a possible strong competition for
   mates among males, as observed in captivity. Males, females and some
   juveniles occur in Argentinean and Uruguayan waters, where mating takes
   place. Pregnant females occur in subtropical waters of southern Brazil,
   where they give birth. Given that pregnant and non-pregnant females occur
   at the same time in different zones, we suggest that the female
   reproductive cycle is biennial. Striking differences among migratory
   patterns of sand tiger sharks from the SW and NW Atlantic and South
   Africa were observed. Copyright 2002 International Council for the

AB Shark diving tourism is a burgeoning, global industry. The growing
   perception that sharks can be worth more alive for tourism than dead in a
   fish market has become one of the leading contemporary arguments for
   shark conservation. However, there still exists concern that many aspects
   of shark-related tourism (e.g., provisioning) may alter natural behaviors
   and foraging areas, as well as pose a threat to humans by associating
   people with food. These concerns are largely driven by the previously
   limited scientific knowledge regarding the effects of shark diving
   tourism on shark biology, the marine environment and human interactions.
   Here we review and summarize previous research in these areas and
   evaluate the potential effects of dive tourism on shark behavior, ecology
   and subsequent human dimensions. To assist the development of future
   research, we provide a set of research questions. Taken together, we
   conclude that under the right conditions and if done in a precautionary,
   responsible manner, shark diving can provide a net conservation benefit
   (i.e., garnering of protective measures, raising awareness, instilling a
   conservation ethic) for a handful of species.

   a harvest matrix. Two species are used as examples: the short-lived

   that maintain a stationary population size cause reproductive values to
   change in opposing ways, but they remove equal fractions of the

AB Background Whale sharks are a declining species for which little
   biological data is available. While these animals are protected in many
   parts of their range, they are fished legally and illegally in some
   countries. Baseline biological and ecological data are needed to allow
   the formulation of an effective conservation plan for whale sharks. It is
   not known, for example, whether the whale shark is represented by a
   single worldwide panmictic population or by numerous, reproductively
   isolated populations. Genetic analysis of population structure is one
   essential component of the baseline data required for whale shark
   conservation. Methodology/Principal Findings We have identified 8
   polymorphic microsatellites in the whale shark and used these markers to
   assess genetic variation and population structure in a panel of whale
   sharks covering a broad geographic region. This is the first record of
   microsatellite loci in the whale shark, which displayed an average of 9
   alleles per locus and mean Ho = 0.66 and He = 0.69. All but one of the
   eight loci meet the expectations of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Analysis
   of these loci in whale sharks representing three major portions of their
   range, the Pacific (P), Caribbean (C), and Indian (I) Oceans, determined
   that there is little population differentiation between animals sampled
   in different geographic regions, indicating historical gene flow between
   populations. FST values for inter-ocean comparisons were low (P×C =
   0.0387, C×I = 0.0296 and P×I = −0.0022), and only C×I approached
   statistical significance (p = 0.0495). Conclusions/Significance We have
   shown only low levels of genetic differentiation between geographically
   distinct whale shark populations. Existing satellite tracking data have
   revealed both regional and long-range migration of whale sharks
   throughout their range, which supports the finding of gene flow between
   populations. Whale sharks traverse geographic and political boundaries
   during their life history and interbreed with animals from distant
   populations; conservation efforts must therefore target international
   protection for this species.

AB Secondary effects of capture and handling stress in the Atlantic
   sharpnose shark, Rhizoprionodon terraenovae, were investigated in this
   study. Twenty-four sharks were serially bled and changes in several
   hematological parameters were monitored over a 1-h time period, following
   capture by hook-and-line. Blood samples were obtained from each shark at
   0, 15, 30, 45 and 60 min. All 0-min (initial) blood samples were obtained
   within 3 min of capture. Blood glucose (9.2–13.1 mmol l−1), lactate
   (1.5–28.9 mmol l−1), and plasma osmolality (871–929 mOsm kg−1) all
   increased after capture, whereas blood pH (6.86–6.78) declined.
   Hematocrit values (initial = 25.1%) remained unchanged throughout the 1-h
   stress period. Due to the short amount of time it took to obtain the
   initial sample and the lack of a significant relationship between the
   initial time and the initial parameter levels, all initial samples are
   considered the best approximation of the predisturbance resting levels.
   The use of repeated measures in this study enables us to describe the
   dynamics of the secondary stress response in the Atlantic sharpnose
   shark.

AB BACKGROUND: Although much is known about the behavior of white sharks in
   coastal regions, very little is known about their vertical movements
   offshore in the eastern Pacific where they spend up to five months. We
   provide the first detailed description of the offshore habitat use of
   white sharks in the eastern North Pacific. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL
   FINDINGS: This study uses 2-min data from four recovered pop-up satellite
   archival tags deployed at Guadalupe Island (2002 and 2005). Deployments
   ranged from 5.4 to 8.2 months. Two predominant vertical patterns were
   described. The first was a bimodal vertical pattern with time spent at
   the surface and at depth, which was observed while traveling. The second
   was a repetitive oscillatory diving mode displayed by sharks in the
   Shared Offshore Foraging Area (SOFA). For all four datasets the average
   maximum daily dive depths ranged from 442.5 to 492.8 m and were typically
   associated with dissolved oxygen concentrations of above 1.7 ml L(-1).
   Although infrequent, occasional dives to near 1000 m with a minimum
   temperature of 3.9 degrees C and a minimum O(2) level of 0.3 ml L(-1)
   were observed. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Recovered pop-up satellite tags
   from Guadalupe Island white sharks advance our understanding of the
   vertical habitat use of white sharks while offshore. The bimodal vertical
   pattern during traveling is most likely related to geolocation. The
   oscillatory dive pattern is likely associated with foraging. While
   feeding is not documented, foraging is likely occurring in association
   with the deep scattering layer. Diving depths were not limited by
   temperature but were constrained by O(2) levels below approximately 1.5
   ml L(-1). While oxygen may limit the extent of sharks' vertical
   movements, it will also impact prey distribution. Consequently, the
   shallow oxygen minimum zone in the SOFA may act to concentrate prey, thus
   enhancing foraging opportunities in these oligotrophic waters.

AB Abstract The capacity of a natural antioxidant derived from barley husks
   to retard oxidation of PUFA in blue shark muscle was investigated. Blue
   shark slices were packaged in low density polyethylene (LDPE) film
   containing the natural antioxidant (sample C1 = 7 mg/dm 2 film, and
   sample C2 = 24 mg/dm 2 film) or in LDPE film without the antioxidant
   (control sample) and frozen for 12 months. Peroxide value was
   significantly higher in control samples during the first six months than
   in samples C1 and C2. The free fatty acids content was significantly
   higher in the control samples than in samples C1 and C2 during the 12
   months of the study. Up to the sixth month of storage, the concentrations
   of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances in C1 and C2 were
   significantly lower than in the control sample. The results demonstrate
   that hydrolytic activity and lipid oxidation are sensitive to antioxidant
   content and storage time. The results confirm the efficacy of active
   packaging with a natural antioxidant derived from barley husks to slow
   the progress of lipid hydrolysis and increase oxidative stability in blue
   shark muscle. Industrial relevance: The use of barley husks, which is a
   residue the brewing process unwieldy and unhelpful, is optimized to
   obtain a crude extract antioxidant. Natural extracts of phenolic
   compounds with high antioxidant activity was obtained after prehydrolysis
   and delignification of barley husks. The raw extracts show more than
   twice higher antioxidant capacity than BHT in terms of EC50. The crude
   extract antioxidant has as important feature his high content of
   p-coumaric and ferulic acid. The results demonstrated the efficacy of an
   active packaging with a natural antioxidant derived from barley husks.
   The extract dosed on the surface of the film shows and maintains an
   excellent antioxidant capacity and is not separated of film in aqueous or
   oily media, so these can be used in a wide type of food.

AB Are pelagic species such as sharks and tuna distributed homogenously or

   been observed at seamounts and offshore islands in the eastern tropical
   Pacific, which are considered hotspots of pelagic biodiversity. Is the
   species distribution uniform at these hotspots or do species aggregate at
   a finer spatial scale at these sites? We employed three techniques to
   demonstrate that the aggregations of scalloped hammerhead sharks, Sphyrna
   lewini, and other pelagic species were confined to the southeastern
   corner of Wolf Island in the Galapagos Marine Reserve. Coded ultrasonic
   transmitters were placed on individuals at this site and at another
   aggregation site at Darwin Island, separated from Wolf by 40 km, and they
   were detected by monitors moored at the southeastern corner of Wolf
   Island and rarely by monitors deployed at other sites around the island.
   Hammerhead sharks, carrying depth-sensing continual transmitters, were
   tracked for two-day periods in a vessel and shown to reside a
   disproportionately large fraction of their time at the southeastern
   corner. Visual censuses were carried out seasonally at the eight monitor
   sites at Wolf Island, recording the abundance of one species of tuna,
   four species of jacks, and a number of other species. The highest
   diversity and abundance of these species occurred in the southeastern
   corner of the island. Our results support the use of hammerhead sharks as
   indicator and umbrella species for pelagic hotspots on a fine scale.

AB Any attempt to describe the spatial ecology of sharks and rays should
   consider the drivers responsible for movement. Research has shown
   fluctuations in the environment (abiotic factors) can trigger movement
   and changes in behaviour and habitat use for many elasmobranch species.
   Most studies to date have selectively focused on a small number of
   abiotic factors (i.e. temperature, salinity); however, other factors such
   as dissolved oxygen, tide, photoperiod, barometric pressure and pH have
   also been documented to act as drivers of movement in shark and ray
   species. Although usually examined individually, abiotic factors rarely
   act in isolation and often differ in their level of influence between
   species, sex, ontogenetic stage, season and geographic location. This
   paper reviews the role of abiotic factors as a driver of movement and
   changes in behaviour and habitat use in elasmobranchs. In the context of
   a changing climate, insight into how sharks and rays may respond to
   fluctuating environmental conditions projected under future scenarios is
   required.

UR http://www.freepatentsonline.com/5618925.html
PY 1995
AB The present invention relates to shark cartilage extracts and to a method
   of producing the same, these extracts having anti-angiogenic properties
   (reduction of the area of blood vessels observed in vivo on
   experimentally induced tumors), tumor regressive activity in vivo as well
   as demonstrating a direct inhibitory effect on tumor cell lines. This
   process does not involve any denaturing solvent or product and does not
   involve the use of any enzymes. It consists of obtaining a blend of whole
   cartilage in an aqueous solution of neutral pH, preferably pure water,
   this blend being centrifuged and the pellet and supernatant kept for
   further processing. The pellet is lyophylized and tested for anti-tumor
   and anti-angiogenic activities in vivo and in vitro, with or without
   supernatant. The supernatant has been shown to have anti-angiogenic and
   tumor regressive activities in vivo. The composition of the supernatant
   has then been investigated by different ways. Fractionation of this
   supernatant led to the characterization of some of its active components.
   The fractions were tested for their direct in vitro activity on cancer
   cell lines. Therefore, it is assumed that the non-fractionated
   supernatant has such an in vitro activity. Lyophilization substantially
   destroys the activity of these liquid fractions while no such abolition
   is observed in the solid extract.

AB : The afferent connections of the tectum mesencephali were studied in the
   spotted dogfish Scyliorhinus canicula and the thornback ray Raja clavata
   by means of the horseradish peroxidase (HRP) technique. Following
   unilateral injections in the tectum, labeled neurons could be identified
   in all main divisions of the brain and in the cervical spinal cord.
   Telencephalic neurons which project to the tectum mesencephali were
   observed in the caudal part of the pallium. Diencephalic projections to
   the tectum originate from the thalamus dorsalis pars medialis, the
   thalamus ventralis pars lateralis, the nucleus medius infundibuli, and
   the pretectal area. In Scyliorhinus labeled neurons could also be found
   in the corpus geniculatum laterale. Mesencephalic cells of origin of
   tectal afferent pathways were identified in the stratum cellulare
   externum of the contralateral tectum, in the nucleus tegmentalis
   lateralis, in the ventrolateral tegmentum, and in the nucleus ruber.
   Rhombencephalic cells projecting to the tectum could be identified in the
   nucleus cerebelli (only in Scyliorhinus), the nucleus vestibularis
   superior, the reticular formation, the nucleus funiculi lateralis, the
   nucleus tractus descendens nervi trigemini, and the nucleus dorsalis and
   intermedius areae octavolateralis. In addition a number of small-and
   medium-sized cells of the reticular formation were found labeled.
   Diffusely scattered labeled cells could be observed in the dorsal part of
   the cervical spinal cord. It is concluded that the tectal afferent
   connections in the chondrichthyans studied in general resemble those of
   other vertebrates, but that some striking differences exist. In
   particular, tectal afferents originating from the nucleus medius
   infundibuli, the nucleus cerebelli, and the nucleus dorsalis and
   intermedius areae octavolateralis have not been reported in other
   vertebrates.

AB Abstract A mouse VH probe has been used to identify and isolate VH
   homologs in a DNA library of Heterodontus francisci (horned shark). The
   complete nucleotide sequence of one VH gene, HXIA, has been determined
   and found to exhibit striking organizational homology and nucleotide
   identity with mammalian prototype VH genes. Metric analysis of the
   complete sequence is consistent with the early phylogenetic
   diversification of framework and complementarity-determining regions
   (CDR). Both the predicted amino acid sequence and the specific
   hybridization of the CDR2-specific, synthetic oligodeoxynucleotide probe
   in spleen mRNA suggest that HXIA is functionally expressed. A probe
   consisting of the entire coding region of this gene hybridizes with
   multiple components in Southern blot analysis of Heterodontus genomic DNA
   and together with the identification of additional unique VH+-lambda
   clones indicates that considerable complexity is associated with the
   germline VH gene family in a contemporary species that represents an
   early stage in the phylogenetic development of the vertebrates.

AB : As part of a study on retino-telencephalic pathways the ascending
   connections to the telencephalic central nucleus were investigated by
   retrograde transport of horseradish peroxidase. The central nucleus of
   the telencephalon, which is the main recipient for input from the
   brainstem, grossly can be divided into three rostrocaudal parts according
   to their afferent connections. The rostral third receives input mainly
   from the contralateral central thalamic nucleus and to a lesser degree
   from the lateral geniculate nucleus, periventricular gray, and a nucleus
   called the ventral mesencephalic tegmentum. The middle third of the
   central nucleus maintains an afferent connection with contralateral
   lateral geniculate, ventrolateral optic, and central thalamic nucleus,
   with the ventral mesencephalic tegmentum and periventricular gray
   bilaterally, and with a group of cells in the superior raphe nucleus.
   Caudal central nucleus injections of HRP resulted in labeling of cells in
   the contralateral lateral geniculate nucleus, ventral mesencephalic
   tegmentum, and central thalamic bilaterally, and in the superior raphe
   nucleus preoptic area and periventricular gray. From these results it can
   be concluded that visual information may reach the central telencephalic
   nucleus by two separate pathways: one pathway from retina via
   ventrolateral optic nucleus to the middle third of the central nucleus,
   and a second pathway from retina to optic tectum, which reportedly
   projects to the lateral geniculate nucleus, which in turn provides
   afferents to the caudal two-thirds of the central nucleus. As such the
   nurse shark's visual system possesses structural features that are
   homologous to the two visual systems of higher vertebrate groups.

   Gillnet mesh-size had major effects on catch composition and catch rate,
   whereas gillnet hanging ratio, hook-size, hook shank-length and
   hook-spacing had minor effects. The gillnets and longlines were much more
   effective at catching chondrichthyans than teleosts, and catches of
   species of cephalopoda, bivalvia, gastropoda, mammalia, aves and reptilia
   were negligible. Any reduction in the present legal minimum mesh-size of
   6 inch the shark fishery would markedly increase by-catch. In gillnets
   monitored by scientific observers aboard commercial vessels during
   1998–01, the ratio of the number of chondrichthyan to teleost animals was
   ~24:1 in Bass Strait and ~5:1 in South Australia. In Bass Strait between
   1973–76 and 1998–2001, the catch rate by 6 inch mesh gillnets of
   chondrichthyans declined by one-third, whereas a change in the catch rate
   of teleosts was not statistically detectable. Most of this decline is
   explained by reductions of 54% by Cephaloscyllium laticeps and of 87% by
   Galeorhinus galeus. The retained commercial catch was 74% of the
   chondrichthyan animals and 58% of the teleosts caught; only 3% of the
   chondrichthyans and 2% of the teleosts were discarded dead. There are
   occasional interactions with protected species (marine mammals and

AB SUMMARY Stable isotope analysis has provided insight into the dietary and
   habitat patterns of many birds, mammals and teleost fish. A crucial
   biological parameter to interpret field stable isotope data is tissue
   incorporation rate, which has not been well studied in large ectotherms.
   We report the incorporation of carbon and nitrogen into the tissues of
   leopard sharks (Triakis semifasciata). Because sharks have relatively
   slow metabolic rates and are difficult to maintain in captivity, no
   long-term feeding study has been conducted until the point of isotopic
   steady state with a diet. We kept six leopard sharks in captivity for
   1250 days, measured their growth, and serially sampled plasma, red blood
   cells and muscle for stable carbon and nitrogen isotope analysis. A
   single-compartment model with first-order kinetics adequately described
   the incorporation patterns of carbon and nitrogen isotopes for these
   three tissues. Both carbon and nitrogen were incorporated faster in
   plasma than in muscle and red blood cells. The rate of incorporation of
   carbon into muscle was similar to that predicted by an allometric
   equation relating isotopic incorporation rate to body mass that was
   developed previously for teleosts. In spite of their large size and
   unusual physiology, the rates of isotopic incorporation in sharks seem to
   follow the same patterns found in other aquatic ectotherms.

AB Age and growth of Carcharhinus obscurus was studied by vertebral ageing
   techniques. The annual formation of growth bands in the vertebrae was
   validated with oxytetracycline-injected individuals at liberty up to 1481
   days. Growth-band counts of vertebral samples from 305 individuals
   ranging in size from 63 to 282 cm fork length were used to construct
   growth curves. Assuming a mean size at birth of 75.3 cm, estimates of von
   Bertalanffy growth parameters for males were: L∞ = 336.5 cm and K = 0.045
   year–1. Growth parameters for females were: L∞= 354.4 cm and K = 0.043
   year–1. The age at maturity was estimated to be 17–22 years for females
   (220–250 cm), and 20 – 23 years for males (230–243 cm). The oldest animal
   aged was a 32-year-old female 274 cm in length. Growth-rate estimates
   based on vertebral ageing for animals up to 5 years of age are similar to
   those from tag–recapture studies on the same population. The results of
   the present study were similar to those for C. obscurus from the
   south-western Indian Ocean and the western North Atlantic Ocean,
   indicating that age and growth are similar among these populations.

AB Abstract All immunoglobulins and T-cell receptors throughout phylogeny
   share regions of highly conserved amino acid sequence. To identify
   possible primitive immunoglobulins and immunoglobulin-like molecules, we
   utilized 3' RACE (rapid amplification of cDNA ends) and a highly
   conserved constant region consensus amino acid sequence to isolate a new
   immunoglobulin class from the sandbar shark Carcharhinus plumbeus. The
   immunoglobulin, termed IgW, in its secreted form consists of 782 amino
   acids and is expressed in both the thymus and the spleen. The molecule
   overall most closely resembles mu chains of the skate and human and a new
   putative antigen binding molecule isolated from the nurse shark (NAR).
   The full-length IgW chain has a variable region resembling human and
   shark heavy-chain (VH) sequences and a novel joining segment containing
   the WGXGT motif characteristic of H chains. However, unlike any other
   H-chain-type molecule, it contains six constant (C) domains. The first C
   domain contains the cysteine residue characteristic of C mu1 that would
   allow dimerization with a light (L) chain. The fourth and sixth domains
   also contain comparable cysteines that would enable dimerization with
   other H chains or homodimerization. Comparison of the sequences of IgW V
   and C domains shows homology greater than that found in comparisons among
   VH and C mu or VL, or CL thereby suggesting that IgW may retain features
   of the primordial immunoglobulin in evolution.

AB Great white sharks are protected by national legislation in several
   countries, making this species the most widely protected elasmobranch in
   the world. Although the market demand for shark fins in general has
   continued to grow, the value and extent of utilization of white shark
   fins in trade has been controversial. We combine law enforcement with
   genetic profiling to demonstrate that illegal trade in fins of this
   species is occurring in the contemporary international market.
   Furthermore, we document the presence of fins from very young white
   sharks in the trade, suggesting a multiple-use market (food to trophies)
   exists for fins of this species. The presence of small fins in the trade
   contradicts the view that white shark fins have market value only as
   large display trophies, and not as food. Our findings indicate that
   effective conservation of protected shark species will require
   international management regimes that include monitoring of the shark
   fishery and trade on a species-specific basis.

   Stomach temperatures were elevated over ambient water temperatures by as

AB The new antigen receptor (IgNAR) antibodies from sharks are disulphide
   bonded dimers of two protein chains, each containing one variable and
   five constant domains. Three types of IgNAR variable domains have been
   discovered, with Type 3 appearing early in shark development and being
   overtaken by the antigen-driven affinity-matured Type 1 and 2 response.
   Here, we have determined the first structure of a naturally occurring
   Type 2 IgNAR variable domain, and identified the disulphide bond that
   links and stabilizes the CDR1 and CDR3 loops. This disulphide bridge
   locks the CDR3 loop in an “upright” conformation in contrast to other
   shark antibody structures, where a more lateral configuration is
   observed. Further, we sought to model the Type 3 isotype based on the
   crystallographic structure reported here. This modeling indicates (1)
   that internal Type 3-specific residues combine to pack into a compact
   immunoglobulin core that supports the CDR loop regions, and (2) that
   despite apparent low-sequence variability, there is sufficient plasticity
   in the CDR3 loop to form a conformationally diverse antigen-binding
   surface.

AB Abstract Recovery from anaerobic exercise is thought to be prolonged in
   elasmobranchs because they lack several mechanisms for maintaining or
   increasing oxygen delivery that are present in teleosts. For example,
   teleosts increase hematocrit and maximal blood-oxygen carrying capacity
   through red cell ejection from the spleen. Teleosts also counteract the
   reduction in hemoglobin oxygen affinity resulting from metabolic acidosis
   through an adrenergic-mediated increase in red cell Na + –H + exchanger
   activity. To begin to assess the consequences of anaerobic exercise
   accompanying catch-and-release fishing occurring within the estuarine
   nursery habitats of juvenile sandbar sharks ( Carcharhinus plumbeus ,
   Nardo), we constructed blood-oxygen equilibrium curves using samples from
   individuals 1 h after capture by hook and line (exercise-stressed) and
   samples from fully-recovered animals maintained in a shore-side tank
   (control sharks). We also compared exercise-stressed and control sharks
   for hemoglobin concentration, hematocrit, red cell count, intracellular
   pH, and nucleoside triphosphate concentration ([NTP]). In contrast to
   results from previous studies on elasmobranchs, we found an elevation in
   both hematocrit (≈ 21%) and blood hemoglobin concentration (≈ 10%) in
   exercise-stressed sharks. There was also clear evidence of red cell
   swelling. Mean red cell volume was ≈ 28% higher and mean cell hemoglobin
   concentration was ≈ 10% lower in exercise-stressed sharks. Most
   important, in spite of significant metabolic acidosis (0.3 pH units),
   blood from exercise-stressed sharks had an oxygen affinity equivalent to
   that of blood from control sharks. This was a direct consequence of
   intracellular pH being alkalinized by approximately 0.15 pH units
   relative to plasma pH in exercise-stressed sharks. Our results using
   isolated hemoglobin solutions showed that the observed reduction (≈ 15%)
   in intracellular [NTP] also contributed to the leftward shift in the
   oxygen equilibrium curves. As expected, we found sandbar shark red cells
   to be unresponsive to exogenous catecholamines. Regardless, sandbar
   sharks appear able to prevent the decrease in blood-oxygen affinity
   resulting from anaerobic exercise (and the concomitant decreases in
   plasma pH), as has been well-documented in teleosts. Our results suggest,
   therefore, that oxygen delivery following exhaustive exercise is not
   necessarily compromised in juvenile sandbar sharks, and that hook and
   line capture and subsequent release do not increase rates of mortality,
   although both are yet to be directly confirmed.

   resulted in marine collagen hydrolysate (low-molecular-weight gelatin)
   being sold as supplements and cosmetics in Japan. Shark skin collagen is
   one of the important sources of marine collagen. We examined the effect
   of shark skin gelatin in an osteoporosis model animal. Methods Shark skin
   gelatin was orally administered to ovariectomized rats with a low-protein
   diet. Bone mineral density of the right femur was measured. Collagen and
   glycosaminoglycan in the tibial end were extracted and analyzed by
   western blotting and cellulose acetate membrane electrophoresis,
   respectively. Results Administering collagen to the ovariectomized rats
   resulted in the bone mineral density of the femur epiphysis being higher
   than that in the sham-operated rats. The contents of type I collagen and
   glycosaminoglycan in the epiphysis were increased by administering shark
   skin gelatin. Conclusions These results indicated that shark skin gelatin
   would be useful as a dietary supplement for treating osteoporosis.

   superior hunter in the nature, for finding prey, which is taken from the
   smell sense of shark and its movement to the odor source. Various
   behaviors of shark within the search environment, that is, sea water, are
   mathematically modeled within the proposed optimization approach. The
   effectiveness of the suggested approach is compared with many other
   heuristic optimization methods based on standard benchmark functions.
   Also, to illustrate the efficiency of the proposed optimization method
   for solving real-world engineering problems, it is applied for the
   solution of load frequency control problem in electrical power systems.
   The obtained results confirm the validity of the proposed metaheuristic

AB Annual deposition of growth bands in vertebrae has been validated for
   many shark species, and is now widely regarded as the norm. However,
   vertebrae are part of the shark's axial skeleton, and band deposition may
   stop in old sharks when somatic growth ceases. We aged vertebral sections
   from New Zealand porbeagle sharks (Lamna nasus) under reflected white
   light and using X-radiographs. Bomb radiocarbon assays supported
   vertebral age estimates up to ∼20 years, but not at older ages. The
   results suggest that older porbeagles were under-aged by as much as 50%
   from vertebral band counts, presumably because band width declined to a
   point where it became unresolvable. This has important implications for
   growth studies on other long-lived sharks. Estimated ages at sexual
   maturity were 8-11 years for males and 15-18 years for females, and
   longevity may be ∼65 years. New Zealand and North Atlantic porbeagles
   differ in these parameters, and in length at maturity and maximum length,
   suggesting genetic isolation of the two populations.

AB Most arguments invoked so far by the scientific community in favour of
   shark conservation rely on the ecological importance of sharks, and have
   little impact on management policies. During a 57-month study, we were
   able to individually recognise 39 sicklefin lemon sharks that support a
   shark-feeding ecotourism activity in Moorea Island, French Polynesia. We
   calculated the direct global revenue generated by the provisioning site,
   based on the expenses of local and international divers. The total yearly
   revenue was around USD5.4 million and the 13 sharks most often observed
   at the site had an average contribution each of around USD316 699. Any
   one of these sharks represents a potential contribution of USD2.64
   million during its life span. We argue that publicising economic values
   per individual will be more effective than general declarations about
   their ecological importance for convincing policy makers and fishers that
   a live shark is more valuable than a dead shark for the local economy.
   Studies monitoring the potential negative ecological effects of long-term
   feeding of sharks should, however, be conducted to ensure these are also
   considered. Besides declarations about the non-consumptive direct-use
   value of sharks, as promoted by ecotourism, the calculation of their
   other economic values should also benefit shark conservation.

AB Increasing catch rates are considered the main impact of dynamic
   fisheries practices on marine ecosystems, but other effects can be
   equally important and are often ignored. Here we quantify a major,
   previously unknown source of shark mortality: entanglement in drifting
   fish aggregating devices, now widely used in the global tropical tuna
   purse-seine fishery. Using satellite tagging and underwater observational
   data, we developed two novel, independent, and complementary approaches,
   which quantify and highlight the scale of this problem. Entanglement
   mortality of silky sharks (Carcharhinus falciformis) in the Indian Ocean
   was 5–10 times that of the known bycatch of this imperiled species from
   the region's purse-seine fleet. More importantly, these estimates from a
   single ocean (480 000–960 000 silky sharks) mirror those from all world
   fisheries combined (400 000–2 million silky sharks), a situation that
   clearly requires immediate management intervention and extensive
   monitoring.

PY 2000
AB Porbeagle sharks, Lamna nasus, are caught in large numbers as bycatch in
   tuna longline fisheries in the southwest Pacific Ocean. Information on
   reproduction, embryonic development, and size and sex composition was
   col- lected by scientific observers from New Zealand and Australian
   waters, and sup- plemented with data from other sources. Most sharks were
   juveniles less than 150 cm fork length (FL), and length-fre- quency
   distributions showed 3-5 modal peaks that we interpret as age classes.
   Juveniles grow linearly and rapidly (16- 20 cm per year), reaching
   110-125 cm FL in three years. Females mature at around 165-180 cm. Litter
   size is usually four embryos and parturition probably peaks in June-July
   (winter). This finding con- trasts with data for North Atlantic
   porbeagles which give birth in spring- summer. Embryos grow about 7 cm
   per month, and are born at 58-67 cm FL. The gestation period appears to
   be about 8-9 months, but there is considerable vari- ability in embryo
   length at any one time, suggesting an extended mating period. Embryos are
   nourished by oophagy, and develop a grossly distended abdomen as their
   "yolk stomach" fills with ova. Small embryos have fang-like functional
   teeth that tear open egg capsules to release the contained ova. The fangs
   are shed at 34-38 cm FL. The weight of yolk in the stomach peaks at 30-42
   cm FL, and accounts for up to 81% of total body weight. Waste products of
   yolk diges- tion accumulate steadily in the spiral valve throughout
   gestation, and the liver reaches its maximum size in near-term embryos as
   excess energy from yolk digestion is stored for postnatal use.

AB Sharks are among the most threatened groups of marine species.
   Populations are declining globally to support the growing demand for
   shark fin soup. Sharks are known to bioaccumulate toxins that may pose
   health risks to consumers of shark products. The feeding habits of sharks
   are varied, including fish, mammals, crustaceans and plankton. The
   cyanobacterial neurotoxin β-N-methylamino-L-alanine (BMAA) has been
   detected in species of free-living marine cyanobacteria and may
   bioaccumulate in the marine food web. In this study, we sampled fin clips
   from seven different species of sharks in South Florida to survey the
   occurrence of BMAA using HPLC-FD and Triple Quadrupole LC/MS/MS methods.
   BMAA was detected in the fins of all species examined with concentrations
   ranging from 144 to 1836 ng/mg wet weight. Since BMAA has been linked to
   neurodegenerative diseases, these results may have important relevance to
   human health. We suggest that consumption of shark fins may increase the
   risk for human exposure to the cyanobacterial neurotoxin BMAA.

AB There is growing interest in the mating systems of sharks and their
   relatives (Class Chondrichthyes) because these ancient fishes occupy a
   key position in vertebrate phylogeny and are increasingly in need of
   conservation due to widespread overexploitation. Based on precious few
   genetic and field observational studies, current speculation is that
   polyandrous mating strategies and multiple paternity may be common in
   sharks as they are in most other vertebrates. Here, we test this
   hypothesis by examining the genetic mating system of the bonnethead
   shark, Sphyrna tiburo, using microsatellite DNA profiling of 22 litters
   (22 mothers, 188 embryos genotyped at four polymorphic loci) obtained
   from multiple locations along the west coast of Florida. Contrary to
   expectations based on the ability of female S. tiburo to store sperm, the
   social nature of this species and the 100% multiple paternity observed in
   two other coastal shark species, over 81% of sampled bonnethead females
   produced litters sired by a single male (i.e. genetic monogamy). When
   multiple paternity occurred in S. tiburo, there was an indication of
   increased incidence in larger mothers with bigger litters. Our data
   suggest that sharks may exhibit complex genetic mating systems with a
   high degree of interspecific variability, and as a result some species
   may be more susceptible to loss of genetic variation in the face of
   escalating fishing pressure. Based on these findings, we suggest that
   knowledge of elasmobranch mating systems should be an important component
   of conservation and management programmes for these heavily exploited
   species.

   sulfate (CS) and dermatan sulfate (DS) hybrid chains in the brain's
   development and critical roles for oversulfated disaccharides and IdoUA
   residues in the growth factor-binding and neuritogenic activities of
   these chains. In the pursuit of sources of CS/DS with unique structures,
   neuritogenic activity, and therapeutic potential, two novel CS/DS
   preparations were isolated from shark liver by anion exchange
   chromatography. The major (80%) low sulfated and minor (20%) highly
   sulfated fractions had an average molecular mass of 3.8–38.9 and 75.7
   kDa, respectively. Digestion with various chondroitinases (CSases)
   revealed a large panel of disaccharides with either GlcUA or IdoUA
   scattered along the polysaccharide chains in both of the fractions. The
   higher Mr fraction, richer in IdoUA(2-O-sulfate)α1–3GalNAc(4-O-sulfate)
   and GlcUAβ/IdoUAα1–3GalNAc(4,6-O-disulfate) units, exerted greater
   neurite outgrowth-promoting (NOP) activity and better promoted the
   binding of various heparin-binding growth factors, including pleiotrophin
   (PTN), midkine, recombinant human heparin-binding epidermal growth
   factor-like growth factor, VEGF165, fibroblast growth factor-2,
   fibroblast growth factor-7, and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF). These
   activities were largely abolished by digestion with CSase ABC or B but
   only moderately affected by a mixture of CSases AC-I and AC-II. In
   addition, the NOP activity of the larger fraction was markedly reduced by
   desulfation with alkali, suggesting a role for the 2-O-sulfate of
   IdoUA(2-O-sulfate)α1–3GalNAc(4-O-sulfate). The NOP activity of the higher
   molecular weight fraction and that of the embryonic pig brain-derived
   CS/DS fraction were also sup pressed to a large extent by antibodies
   against HGF, PTN, and their individual receptors cMet and anaplastic
   lymphoma kinase, revealing the involvement of the HGF and PTN signaling
   pathways in the activity.

   to conventional antibodies. In this report, we construct and characterize
   a diversity enhanced semi-synthetic NAR V display library based on
   naturally occurring NAR V sequences. A semi-synthetic shark sdAb display
   library with a complexity close to 1e9 was constructed. This was achieved
   by introducing size and sequence variations in CDR3 using randomized CDR3
   primers of three different lengths. Binders against three toxins,
   staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB), ricin, and botulinum toxin A (BoNT/A)
   complex toxoid, were isolated from panning the display library. Soluble
   sdAbs from selected binders were purified and evaluated using direct
   binding and thermal stability assays on the Luminex 100. In addition,
   sandwich assays using sdAb as the reporter element were developed to
   demonstrate their utility for future sensor applications. We demonstrated
   the utility of a newly created hyper diversified shark NAR displayed
   library to serve as a source of thermal stable sdAbs against a variety of
   toxins.

AB The variable (V), (diversity [D]), and joining (J) region recombinases
   (recombination activating genes [RAGs]) can perform like transposases and
   are thought to have initiated development of the adaptive immune system
   in early vertebrates by splitting archaic V genes with transposable
   elements. In cartilaginous fishes, the immunoglobulin (Ig) light chain
   genes are organized as multiple VJ-constant (C) clusters; some loci are
   capable of rearrangement while others contain fused VJ. The latter may be
   key to understanding the evolutionary role of RAG. Are they relics of the
   archaic genes, or are they results of rearrangement in germ cells? Our
   data suggest that some fused VJ genes are not only recently rearranged,
   but also resulted from RAG-like activity involving hairpin intermediates.
   Expression studies show that these, like some other germline-joined Ig
   sequences, are expressed at significant levels only early in ontogeny. We
   suggest that a rejoined Ig gene may not merely be a sequence restricting
   antibody diversity, but is potentially a novel receptor no longer tied to
   somatic RAG expression and rearrangement. From the combined data, we
   arrived at the unexpected conclusion that, in some vertebrates, RAG is
   still an active force in changing the genome.

AB Abstract A method of estimating above-ground productivity in situ of the
   seagrass Amphibolis antarctica (Labill.) Sonder & Aschers. has been
   devised, using tags to determine rates of leaf turnover. This has proved
   an effective tool in establishing the behavior of the species in relation
   to the gradient of increasing salinity which is present in Shark Bay. No
   seagrass was found beyond 64%o, but measurement of production and biomass
   within dense patches of seagrass at different salinities revealed that
   these were at a maximum at a salinity of 42%o, decreasing as the salinity
   increased and also at lower oceanic concentrations. Production rates
   ranged from 2 to 17 g dry weight m−2 day−1 with biomass from 600 to 2000
   g m−2, thus Amphibolis antarctica is one of the more productive
   Australian seagrass species, even in the hypersaline conditions of the
   Bay. Despite the obvious correlation between above-ground production and
   salinity, it is pointed out that the results are not taken to imply
   causality.

   click-evoked compound action potential of the eighth nerve has a dynamic
   range of at least 30 dB, with a latency shortening of 120 to 170 μs/dB
   and an amplitude increase of 4 to 11%/dB relative to a nearly saturated
   response. The shape of the potential is dependent on the click phase and
   with the top of the head out of water these potentials are evoked by
   clicks with air sound pressure levels as low as 19.5 dB re 1 μbar and
   velocity levels in the water as low as 23 dB re 1 μvar. The calculated
   displacement thresholds range from 5×10−8 to 4×10−7 cm for this response,
   overlapping and extending slightly below the thresholds previously
   reported for whole animals. The frequency sensitivity for this measure of
   the ear's response also agrees with behavioral data, suggesting that the
   ear is the primary site for sound detection.

   growth parameters were estimated using three different techniques:
   vertebral ageing, back calculation and length frequency. Vertebrae from
   138 specimens were sectioned and narrow circuli counted to estimate age.
   Marginal increment analysis verified that circuli were produced annually
   in late summer, probably as a result of stress during the mating season.
   The oldest female was 7 and male 6 years old. Von Bertalanffy growth
   parameters estimated from vertebral ageing data for males were tO = 0.410
   yr, K = 1.337, L∞ = 652.2 mm, and for females tO = 0.455 yr, K = 1.013
   and L∞ = 732.5 mm. Growth parameters determined by length frequency and
   back calculation techniques concurred with those from vertebral ageing.
   Growth of the 0+ age class was very rapid, averaging 140% of the size at
   birth in the first year. Males and females matured after only one year,
   the lowest age at maturity reported in the family Carcharhinidae. Annual
   growth increments decreased rapidly after maturity, and little growth
   occurred after three years.

AB The sandbar shark, Carcharhinus plumbeus, is a wide-ranging coastal
   species in tropical and temperate regions, and it is the most common
   species of shark in Hawaii, as in many locations where it occurs.
   Information on the diet and feeding habits of this species in the Pacific
   Ocean are extremely limited. For this study we quantified the diet of
   sandbar sharks in Hawaii based on records collected during the Hawaii
   Cooperative Shark Research and Control Program from 1967 to 1969. During
   this program a total of 565 stomachs were examined, of which 265
   contained food. Sharks ranged in size from 59 to 190 cm total length.
   Teleosts were the most common prey group, but both cephalopods and
   crustaceans also occurred frequently. Ontogenetic changes in diet of
   sandbar sharks were apparent, with crustaceans forming a greater
   proportion of the diet of smaller sharks. Both cephalopods and
   elasmobranchs increased in importance with increasing shark size. Prey
   diversity also increased with size, with large, mobile, and reef prey
   species found more commonly in the diet of larger sharks. Mature male and
   female sharks appeared to segregate by depth, though major differences in
   the diet between the sexes were not apparent. However, there was some
   evidence of dietary differences between sharks caught in different depths
   and seasons. The results of this study suggest that sandbar sharks in
   Hawaii and throughout the world, are primarily piscivores, but also
   consume a variety of invertebrate prey, and that their diet varies with
   geographical location and stage of development.

   receptors (antibodies and T cell receptors) are expressed that possess a
   limited immune repertoire. We have isolated a subclass of IgM, IgM1gj,
   from the nurse shark Ginglymostoma cirratum that is preferentially
   expressed in neonates. The variable (V) region gene encoding the heavy
   (H) chain underwent V-D-J rearrangement in germ cells
   (“germline-joined”). Such H chain V genes were discovered over 10 years
   ago in sharks but until now were not shown to be expressed at appreciable
   levels; we find expression of H1gj in primary and secondary lymphoid
   tissues early in life, but in adults only in primary lymphoid tissue,
   which is identified in this work as the epigonal organ. H1gj chain
   associates covalently with light (L) chains and is most similar in
   sequence to IgM H chains, but like mammalian IgG has three rather than
   the four IgM constant domains; deletion of the ancestral IgM C2 domain
   thus defines both IgG and IgM1gj. Because sharks are the members of the
   oldest vertebrate class known to possess antibodies, unique or
   specialized antibodies expressed early in ontogeny in sharks and other
   vertebrates were likely present at the inception of the adaptive immune
   system.

AB The majority of vertebrates are not tolerant to hypoxia but epaulette
   sharks (Hemiscyllium ocellatum) living on shallow reef platforms appear
   to tolerate hypoxic periods during tidal fluctuations. The effects of
   progressive hypoxia on the metabolic and ventilatory responses of these
   elasmobranchs were examined in a closed respirometer. In order to
   determine whether repeated exposure to hypoxia primes these sharks to
   alter their metabolism, one group of sharks was exposed to repeated
   sub-lethal hypoxia, at 5% of air saturation, prior to respirometry. In
   response to falling oxygen concentration [O2], the epaulette shark
   increased its ventilatory rate and maintained its O2 consumption rate
   (Vo2) down to 2.2 mg O2 l−1 at 25 °C. This is the lowest critical [O2]
   ([O2]crit) ever measured for any elasmobranch. After reaching the
   [O2]crit, the shark remained in the respirometer for a further 4–5 h of
   progressive hypoxia. Only after the [O2] fell to 1.0 mg l−1 was there a
   decrease in the ventilatory rate followed by a rise in blood lactate
   levels, indicating that the epaulette shark responds to severe hypoxia by
   entering a phase of metabolic and ventilatory depression. Interestingly,
   hypoxia tolerance was dynamic because hypoxic pre-conditioning lowered
   the Vo2 of the epaulette shark by 29%, which resulted in a significantly
   reduced [O2]crit (1.7 mg O2 l−1), revealing that hypoxic pre-conditioning
   elicits an enhanced physiological response to hypoxia.

AB Abstract The basking shark Cetorhinus maximus is the world's second
   largest fish reaching lengths up to 12 m and weighing up to 4 tonnes. It
   inhabits warm‐temperate to boreal waters circumglobally and has been the
   subject of fisheries exploitation for at least 200 years. There is
   current concern over its population levels as a consequence of directed
   harpoon and net fisheries that in the north‐east Atlantic Ocean alone
   took over 100,000 mature individuals between 1946 and 1997. As a
   consequence, it is not known whether populations are recovering or are at
   a fraction of their historical, pre‐fishing biomass. They are currently
   Red‐listed as vulnerable globally, and endangered in the north‐east
   Atlantic. The basking shark is one of only three shark species that
   filter seawater for planktonic prey and this strategy dominates key
   aspects of its life history. Until recently, very little was known about
   the biology, ecology and behaviour of this elusive species. The advent of
   satellite‐linked electronic tags for tracking has resulted in
   considerable progress in furthering our understanding of basking shark
   behaviour, foraging, activity patterns, horizontal and vertical
   movements, migrations and broader scale distributions. Genetic studies
   are also beginning to reveal important insights into aspects of their
   global population structure, behaviour and evolutionary history. This
   chapter reviews the taxonomy, distribution and habitat, bionomics and
   life history, behaviour, population structure, exploitation, management
   and conservation status of the basking shark. In doing so, it reveals
   that whilst important behavioural and ecological information has been
   gained, there are still considerable gaps in knowledge. In particular,
   these relate to the need to resolve population sizes, spatial dynamics
   such as population sub‐structuring and sexual segregation, the critical
   habitats occupied by pregnant females, and the distribution and scale of
   fishery by‐catch rates. Although challenging, it is arguable that without
   achieving these goals the conservation status of the basking shark will
   be difficult to assess accurately.

AB The promotion of crude shark cartilage extracts as a cure for cancer has
   contributed to at least two significant negative outcomes: a dramatic
   decline in shark populations and a diversion of patients from effective
   cancer treatments. An alleged lack of cancer in sharks constitutes a key
   justification for its use. Herein, both malignant and benign neoplasms of
   sharks and their relatives are described, including previously unreported
   cases from the Registry of Tumors in Lower Animals, and two sharks with
   two cancers each. Additional justifications for using shark cartilage are
   illogical extensions of the finding of antiangiogenic and anti-invasive
   substances in cartilage. Scientific evidence to date supports neither the
   efficacy of crude cartilage extracts nor the ability of effective
   components to reach and eradicate cancer cells. The fact that people
   think shark cartilage consumption can cure cancer illustrates the serious
   potential impacts of pseudoscience. Although components of shark
   cartilage may work as a cancer retardant, crude extracts are ineffective.
   Efficiencies of technology (e.g., fish harvesting), the power of mass
   media to reach the lay public, and the susceptibility of the public to
   pseudoscience amplifies the negative impacts of shark cartilage use. To
   facilitate the use of reason as the basis of public and private
   decision-making, the evidence-based mechanisms of evaluation used daily
   by the scientific community should be added to the training of media and
   governmental professionals. Increased use of logical, collaborative

AB The performance of an organism’s feeding apparatus has obvious
   implications for its fitness and survival. However, the majority of
   studies that focus on chondrichthyan feeding have largely ignored the
   role of teeth. Studying the functional morphology of shark teeth not only
   elucidates the biological role that teeth play in feeding, but also
   provides insight specifically into the evolution of shark feeding because
   teeth are often the only structures available in the fossil record. In
   the present study, we investigate the puncture and draw performance of
   three general categories of extant teeth, tearing-type, cutting-type, and
   cutting–clutching type, as well as three fossil morphologies, utilizing a
   universal testing system. Differences in puncturing performance occurred
   among different prey items, indicating that not all ‘soft’ prey items are
   alike. The majority of teeth were able to puncture different prey items,
   and differences in puncture performance also occurred among tooth types;
   however, few patterns emerged. In some cases, broader triangular teeth
   were less effective at puncturing than narrow-cusped teeth. There were no
   differences between the maximum draw forces and maximum puncture forces.
   Many of the shark teeth in the present study were not only able to
   perform draw and puncture equally well, but also many tooth morphologies
   were functionally equivalent to each other. The findings obtained in the
   present study lend little support to the belief that shark tooth
   morphology is a good predictor of biological role. © 2010 The Linnean

AB To examine variation in diet and daily ration of the bonnethead shark,
   Sphyrna tiburo (Linnaeus 1758), animals were collected from three areas
   in the eastern Gulf of Mexico: northwest Florida (∼29°40′N, 85°13′W),
   Tampa Bay near Anclote Key (∼28°10′N, 82°42.5′W), and Florida Bay
   (∼24°50′N, 80°48′W) from March through September, 1998–2000. In each
   area, diet was assessed by life stage (young-of-the year, juveniles, and
   adults) and quantified using five indices: percent by number (%N),
   percent by weight (%W), frequency of occurrence (%O), index of relative
   importance expressed on a percent basis (%IRI), and %IRI based on diet
   category (%IRIDC). Diet could not be assessed for young-of-the-year in
   Tampa Bay or Florida Bay owing to low sample size. Diet analysis showed
   an ontogenetic shift in northwest Florida. Young-of-the-year stomachs
   from northwest Florida (n = 68, 1 empty) contained a mix of seagrass and
   crustaceans while juvenile stomachs (n = 82, 0 empty) contained a mix of
   crabs and seagrass and adult stomachs (n = 39, 1 empty) contained almost
   exclusively crabs. Crabs made up the majority of both juvenile and adult
   diet in Tampa Bay (n = 79, 2 empty, and n = 88, 1 empty, respectively).
   Juvenile stomachs from Florida Bay (n = 72, 0 empty) contained seagrass
   and a mix of crustaceans while adult stomachs contained more shrimp and
   cephalopods (n = 82, 3 empty). Diets in northwest Florida and Tampa Bay
   were similar. The diet in Florida Bay was different from those in the
   other two areas, consisting of fewer crabs and more cephalopods and
   lobsters. Plant material was found in large quantities in all stomachs
   examined from all locations (>15 %IRIDC in 6 of the 7 life stage-area
   combinations, >30 %IRIDC in 4 of the 7 combinations, and 62 %IRIDC in
   young-of-the-year diet in northwest Florida). Using species- and
   area-specific inputs, a bioenergetic model was constructed to estimate
   daily ration. Models were constructed under two scenarios: assuming plant
   material was and was not part of the diet. Overall, daily ration was
   significantly different by sex, life stage, and region. The bioenergetic
   model predicted increasing daily ration with decreasing latitude and
   decreasing daily ration with ontogeny regardless of the inclusion or
   exclusion of plant material. These results provide evidence that
   bonnetheads continuously exposed to warmer temperatures have elevated
   metabolism and require additional energy consumption to maintain growth
   and reproduction.

AB BACKGROUND Shark cartilage has been a popular complementary or
   alternative medicine intervention. The basis for this popularity is the
   claim that sharks rarely get cancer because of the high proportion of
   cartilage in the shark's body. However, early studies were equivocal.
   Therefore, a clinical trial was conducted to look at the impact of shark
   cartilage in patients with advanced cancer. The primary goal of this
   trial was to determine whether a shark cartilage product improved overall
   survival for patients with advanced cancer who were getting standard
   care. Secondary research goals were to evaluate toxicities, tolerability,
   and quality of life associated with this shark cartilage product. METHODS
   The study was a two-arm, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind,
   clinical trial. Patients with incurable breast or colorectal carcinoma
   had to have good performance status and organ function. Patients could be
   receiving chemotherapy. Patients were all to receive standard care and
   then to be randomly selected to receive either a shark cartilage product
   or an identical-appearing and smelling placebo 3 to 4 times each day.
   RESULTS Data on a total of 83 evaluable patients were analyzed. There was
   no difference in overall survival between patients receiving standard
   care plus a shark cartilage product versus standard care plus placebo.
   Likewise, there was no suggestion of improvement in quality of life for
   patients receiving the shark cartilage, compared with those receiving
   placebo. CONCLUSION This trial was unable to demonstrate any suggestion
   of efficacy for this shark cartilage product in patients with advanced
   cancer. Cancer 2005. © 2005 American Cancer Society.

AB Small-scale and artisanal fisheries for sharks exist in most inshore,
   tropical regions of the world. Although often important in terms of food
   security, their low value and inherent complexity provides an imposing
   hurdle to sustainable management. An observer survey of a small-scale
   commercial gill-net fishery operating within the Great Barrier Reef World
   Heritage area revealed at least 38 species of elasmobranch were present
   in the catch. Of the total elasmobranch catch, 95% was 25 species of
   Carcharhiniformes from the families Carcharhinidae, Hemigaleidae and
   Sphyrnidae. Individual species were captured in a variety of ways by the
   fishery, often with strongly biased sex ratios and in a variety of life
   stages (e.g. neonates, juveniles, adult). Despite this, the main
   carcharhiniform taxa captured could be qualitatively categorised into
   four groups based on similar catch characteristics, body size and
   similarities in life history: small coastal ( 2000 mm); and hammerheads.
   Such groupings can potentially be useful for simplifying management of
   complex multispecies fisheries. The idiosyncrasies of elasmobranch
   populations and how fisheries interact with them provide a challenge for
   management but, if properly understood, potentially offer underutilised
   options for designing management strategies.

PY 2002
AB Reproductive organs from 393 male and 382 female porbeagles (Lamna
   nasus), caught in the western North Atlantic Ocean, were examined to
   determine size at maturity and reproductive cycle. Males ranged in size
   from 86 to 246 cm fork length (FL) and females ranged from 94 to 288 cm
   FL. Maturity in males was best described by an inflection in the
   relationship of clasper length to fork length when combined with clasper
   calcification. Males matured between 162 and 185 cm FL and 50% were
   mature at 174 cm FL. In females, all reproductive organ measurements
   related to body length showed a strong inflection around the size of
   maturity. Females matured between 210 and 230 cm FL and 50% were mature
   at 218 cm FL. After a protracted fall mating period (September–November),
   females give birth to an average of 4.0 young in spring (April−June). As
   in other lamnids, young are nourished through oophagy. Evidence from this
   study indicated a one-year reproductive cycle and gestation period
   lasting 8–9 months.

AB Anthropogenic impacts are believed to be the primary threats to the
   eastern Australian population of grey nurse sharks (Carcharias taurus),
   which is listed as critically endangered, and the most threatened
   population globally. Analyses of 235 polymorphic amplified fragment
   length polymorphisms (AFLP) loci and 700 base pairs of mitochondrial DNA
   control region provide the first account of genetic variation and
   geographical partitioning (east and west coasts of Australia, South
   Africa) in C. taurus. Assignment tests, analysis of relatedness and Fst
   values all indicate that the Australian populations are isolated from
   South Africa, with negligible migration between the east and west
   Australian coasts. There are significant differences in levels of genetic
   variation among regions. Australian C. taurus, particularly the eastern
   population, has significantly less AFLP variation than the other sampling
   localities. Further, the eastern Australian sharks possess only a single
   mitochondrial haplotype, also suggesting a small number of founding
   individuals. Therefore, historical, rather than anthropogenic processes
   most likely account for their depauperate genetic variation. These
   findings have implications for the viability of the eastern Australian
   population of grey nurse sharks.

   study, two highly conserved serine-threonine protein kinases, sgk-1 and
   sgk-2, were cloned from rectal gland tissue of the spiny dogfish (Squalus
   acanthias). Both kinases showed a distinct pattern of tissue specificity,
   with high expression levels in kidney, intestine, liver and heart. In
   rectal gland slices sgk-1 transcription was induced by exposure to
   hypertonic solution, reduction of the extracellular urea concentration,
   and addition of the secretagogues vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP)
   and carbachol. The shark sgk-1 serine-threonine protein kinase may

AB New Zealand’s shark fisheries have increased steadily since 1975 to reach

   (Squalus acanthias), school shark (Galeorhinus galeus), skates (Raja
   nasuta and R. innominata), ghost sharks (Hydrolagus novaezealandiae and
   Hydrolagus sp.), rig (Mustelus lenticulatus) and elephantfish
   (Callorhinchus milii). School shark, rig and elephantfish fisheries have
   long histories, and catches are limited by Individual Transferable
   Quotas. Fisheries for spiny dogfish, skates and ghost sharks have only
   developed since 1979. Spiny dogfish and skate landings are partially
   regulated by total quotas. Other sharks are prohibited target species.
   Blue (Prionace glauca), porbeagle (Lamna nasus) and mako (Isurus
   oxyrinchus) sharks are taken as by-catch of the tuna longline fishery.
   There is a small recreational catch of spiny dogfish, school shark, rig,
   mako shark and blue shark. Historically important Maori fisheries for
   spiny dogfish, school shark and rig are now minor. A beach netting
   programme has operated off Dunedin beaches since 1969 to protect swimmers
   from shark attacks. Fisheries management measures include commercial
   quotas, prohibitions on target fishing many species, recreational bag
   limits, limits on set-net length, mesh size and soak time, and closure of
   many inshore waters to set-netting, trawling and Danish seining.

AB The ultrastructure of the corneal stroma of the spiny dogfish, Squalus
   acanthias, was studied in order to determine whether there was a
   morphologic basis for the alleged inability of the elasmobranch cornea to
   swell, and for the possibly related maintenance of corneal transparency
   when it is immersed in distilled water. The most apparent morphologic
   explanation for the nonswelling properties was the presence of "sutural
   fibers" which seemingly bound the anterior and posterior limits of the
   corneal stroma. The filamentous strands connecting collagen fibers within
   the lamellae were more pronounced than those seen in the corneal stroma
   of other species. Bowman's layer ivas found to comprise 15 per cent of
   the total stromal thickness, yet the structural organization of its
   collagen fibers was incompatible with the "lattice theory" for corneal
   transparency proposed by Maurice. Densitometric studies of a slit-lamp
   photograph of dogfish stroma showed that Bowman's layer scatters less
   light than the underlying tissue. Measurements of collagen fiber size and
   density were made at different depths within the corneal stroma in order
   to provide a basis for future physiologic studies, and to determine
   whether there might be an explanation for transparency consistent with
   the collagenous idtrastructure of both Bowman's layer and the more
   organized corneal stroma.

AB Because shark repellents decrease the vulnerability of firms (and their
   incumbent managers) to the market for corporate control, the decision to
   adopt these devices represents an excellent test of agency theory. In
   this empirical study, we examined the relationships between the adoption
   of shark repellents and several mechanisms that, according to agency
   theory, should align the interests of corporate board members and
   shareholders and/or make directors more effective monitors of management
   behaviour. Of the variables included, only board stock ownership
   (especially by employee directors) was linked to a reduced propensity to
   adopt shark repellents in the predicted manner. Two variables not
   immediately as- sociated with agency theory — the proportion of inside
   directors appointed by the incumbent chief executive officer (CEO) and a
   lower ratio of CEO compensation to the compensation of other top
   executives — were linked to higher rates of shark repellent adoption.
   Given that agency theory explains relatively little of the variance in
   shark repellent adoption, we advocate serious consideration of other
   theoretical formulations for corporate governance, including two
   approaches — stewardship theory and agent morality — that take the moral
   (‘other regarding’) obligations of directors seriously.

AB The spiny dogfish (Squalus acanthias) is a temperate, coastal squaloid
   shark with an antitropical distribution in the Atlantic and Pacific
   oceans. The global population structure of this species is poorly
   understood, although individuals are known to undergo extensive
   migrations within coastal waters and across ocean basins. In this study,
   an analysis of the global population structure of the spiny dogfish was
   conducted using eight polymorphic nuclear microsatellite markers and a
   566-bp fragment of the mitochondrial ND2 gene region. A low level of
   genetic divergence was found among collections from the Atlantic and
   South Pacific basins, whereas a high level of genetic divergence was
   found among Pacific Ocean collections. Two genetically distinct groups
   were recovered by both marker classes: one exclusive to North Pacific
   collections, and one including collections from the South Pacific and
   Atlantic locations. The strong genetic break across the equatorial
   Pacific coincides with major regional differences in the life-history
   characters of spiny dogfish, suggesting that spiny dogfish in areas on
   either side of the Pacific equator have been evolving independently for a
   considerable time. Phylogeographic analyses indicate that spiny dogfish
   populations had a Pacific origin, and that the North Atlantic was
   colonized as a result of a recent range expansion from the South American
   coast. Finally, the available data strongly argue for the taxonomic
   separation of the North Pacific spiny dogfish from S. acanthias and a
   re-evaluation of the specific status of S. acanthias is warranted.

   micro/nano-structures. The biomimetic surface possessing shark-skin
   pattern microstructure was first fabricated by microreplication of
   shark-skin surface based on PDMS; and then it was treated by flame to
   form hierarchical micro/nano-structures that can produce lotus effect.
   The fabricated biomimetic surfaces were characterized with scanning
   electron microscopy (SEM), water contact angle measurements and liquid
   drop impact experiments. The results show that the fabricated
   dual-biomimetic surface possesses both the vivid shark-skin surface
   morphology and the lotus leaf-like hierarchical micro/nano-structures. It
   can exhibit excellent superhydrophobicity that the contact angle is as
   high as 160° and maintain its robustness of the superhydrophobicity
   during the droplet impact process at a relatively high Weber number. The
   mechanism of the micromorphology evolution and microstructural changes on
   the biomimetic shark-skin surface was also discussed here in the process
   of flame treatment. This method is expected to be developed into a novel
   and feasible biomimetic surface manufacturing technique.

AB Vasopressin and oxytocin are mammalian neurohypophysial hormones with
   distinct functions. Vasopressin is involved mainly in osmoregulation and
   oxytocin is involved primarily in parturition and lactation. Jawed
   vertebrates contain at least one homolog each of vasopressin and
   oxytocin, whereas only a vasopressin-family hormone, vasotocin, has been
   identified in jawless vertebrates. The genes encoding vasopressin and
   oxytocin are closely linked tail-to-tail in eutherian mammals whereas
   their homologs in chicken, Xenopus and coelacanth (vasotocin and
   mesotocin) are linked tail-to-head. In contrast, their pufferfish
   homologs, vasotocin and isotocin, are located on the same strand of DNA
   with isotocin located upstream of vasotocin and separated by five genes.
   These differences in the arrangement of the two genes in different bony
   vertebrate lineages raise questions about their origin and ancestral
   arrangement. To trace the origin of these genes, we have sequenced BAC
   clones from the neurohypophysial gene loci in a cartilaginous fish, the
   elephant shark (Callorhinchus milii), and in a jawless vertebrate, the
   Japanese lamprey (Lethenteron japonicum). We have also analyzed the
   neurohypophysial hormone gene locus in an invertebrate chordate, the
   amphioxus (Branchiostoma floridae). The elephant shark neurohypophysial
   hormone genes encode vasotocin and oxytocin, and are linked tail-to-head
   like their homologs in coelacanth and non-eutherian tetrapods. Besides
   the hypothalamus, the two genes are also expressed in the ovary. In
   addition, the vasotocin gene is expressed in the kidney, rectal gland and
   intestine. These expression profiles indicate a paracrine role for the
   two hormones. The lamprey locus contains a single neurohypophysial
   hormone gene, the vasotocin. The synteny of genes in the lamprey locus is
   conserved in elephant shark, coelacanth and tetrapods but disrupted in
   teleost fishes. The amphioxus locus encodes a single neurohypophysial
   hormone, designated as [Ile4]vasotocin. The vasopressin- and
   oxytocin-family of neurohypophysial hormones evolved in a common ancestor
   of jawed vertebrates through tandem duplication of the ancestral
   vasotocin gene. The duplicated genes were linked tail-to-head like their
   homologs in elephant shark, coelacanth and non-eutherian tetrapods. In
   contrast to the conserved linkage of the neurohypophysial genes in these
   vertebrates, the neurohypophysial hormone gene locus has experienced
   extensive rearrangements in the teleost lineage.

   (L95) of males were mature by ∼9.0 m TL. Female whale sharks at Ningaloo

   occurrence of turbulence and reduce the wall friction, but in order to
   understand the mechanism of drag reduction, one has to solve the problem
   of the turbulent flow on grooved-scale surface, and in that respect, the
   direct numerical simulation is an important tool. In this article, based
   on the real biological shark skin, the model of real shark skin is built
   through high-accurate scanning and data processing. The turbulent flow on
   a real shark skin is comprehensively simulated, and based on the
   simulation, the drag reduction mechanism is discussed. In addition, in
   order to validate the drag-reducing effect of shark skin surface, actual
   experiments were carried out in water tunnel, and the experimental

AB The Indo-West Pacific (IWP), from South Africa in the western Indian
   Ocean to the western Pacific Ocean, contains some of the most
   biologically diverse marine habitats on earth, including the greatest
   biodiversity of chondrichthyan fishes. The region encompasses various
   densities of human habitation leading to contrasts in the levels of
   exploitation experienced by chondrichthyans, which are targeted for local
   consumption and export. The demersal chondrichthyan, the zebra shark,
   Stegostoma fasciatum, is endemic to the IWP and has two current regional
   International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List
   classifications that reflect differing levels of exploitation: ‘Least
   Concern’ and ‘Vulnerable’. In this study, we employed mitochondrial ND4
   sequence data and 13 microsatellite loci to investigate the population
   genetic structure of 180 zebra sharks from 13 locations throughout the
   IWP to test the concordance of IUCN zones with demographic units that
   have conservation value. Mitochondrial and microsatellite data sets from
   samples collected throughout northern Australia and Southeast Asia
   concord with the regional IUCN classifications. However, we found
   evidence of genetic subdivision within these regions, including
   subdivision between locations connected by habitat suitable for
   migration. Furthermore, parametric FST analyses and Bayesian clustering
   analyses indicated that the primary genetic break within the IWP is not
   represented by the IUCN classifications but rather is congruent with the
   Indonesian throughflow current. Our findings indicate that recruitment to
   areas of high exploitation from nearby healthy populations in zebra
   sharks is likely to be minimal, and that severe localized depletions are
   predicted to occur in zebra shark populations throughout the IWP region.

AB Inertial suction feeding is known to occur in some sharks, but the
   sequence and temporal kinematics of head and jaw movements have not been
   defined. We investigated the feeding kinematics of a suction feeding
   shark, the nurse shark Ginglymostoma cirratum, to test for differences in
   the timing and magnitude of feeding components with other shark taxa when
   sharks were fed pieces of bony fish. Thirteen kinematic variables were
   measured from high-speed video recordings. Food capture in this species
   consists of expansive, compressive, and recovery phases, as in most other
   sharks, but there is little or no cranial elevation. Mean time to maximum
   gape (32 msec) is the fastest recorded for an elasmobranch fish. Other
   relatively rapid events include mandibular depression (26 msec),
   elevation (66 msec), and total bite time (100 msec). Buccal valves assist
   the unidirectional flow of water into the mouth and out of the gill
   chambers. Food capture under these experimental conditions appears to be
   a stereotyped modal action pattern but with significant interindividual
   variability in timing of kinematic events. Ginglymostoma cirratum
   exhibits a suite of specializations for inertial suction feeding that
   include (1) the formation of a small, anteriorly directed mouth that is
   approximately round and laterally enclosed by modified labial cartilages;
   (2) small teeth; (3) buccal valves to prevent the backflow of water; and
   (4) extremely rapid buccal expansion. Sharks that capture food by
   inertial suction have faster and more stereotyped capture behavior than
   sharks that primarily ram feed. Inertial suction feeding, which has
   evolved multiple times in sharks, represents an example of functional
   convergence with inertial suction feeding bony fishes.

   records. We developed multivariate distribution models of seasonally
   variant whale shark distributions derived from tuna purse-seine fishery
   data. We tested the hypotheses that whale sharks use a narrow temperature
   range, are more abundant in productive waters and select sites closer to
   continents than the open ocean. Location Indian Ocean. Methods We
   compared a 17-year time series of observations of whale sharks associated
   with tuna purse-seine sets with chlorophyll a concentration and sea
   surface temperature data extracted from satellite images. Different sets
   of pseudo-absences based on random distributions, distance to shark
   locations and tuna catch were generated to account for spatiotemporal
   variation in sampling effort and probability of detection. We applied
   generalized linear, spatial mixed-effects and Maximum Entropy models to
   predict seasonal variation in habitat suitability and produced maps of
   distribution. Results The saturated generalized linear models including
   bathymetric slope, depth, distance to shore, the quadratic of mean sea
   surface temperature, sea surface temperature variance and chlorophyll a
   had the highest relative statistical support, with the highest percent
   deviance explained when using random pseudo-absences with fixed
   effect-only models and the tuna pseudo-absences with mixed-effects models
   (e.g. 58% and 26% in autumn, respectively). Maximum Entropy results
   suggested that whale sharks responded mainly to variation in depth,
   chlorophyll a and temperature in all seasons. Bathymetric slope had only
   a minor influence on the presence. Main conclusions Whale shark habitat
   suitability in the Indian Ocean is mainly correlated with spatial
   variation in sea surface temperature. The relative influence of this
   predictor provides a basis for predicting habitat suitability in the open
   ocean, possibly giving insights into the migratory behaviour of the
   world’s largest fish. Our results also provide a baseline for
   temperature-dependent predictions of distributional changes in the
   future.

AB Abstract Tracking movements of marine animals for extended periods at sea
   is very expensive and labour intensive. The only method that shows
   promise for world-wide tracking in long-term studies is satellite
   tracking. The purpose of this study was to test this technique under
   operational conditions on basking sharks in the North Atlantic Ocean.
   These fish feed on plankton near the surface, and the long-term objective
   is to investigate the foraging and migratory movements in relation to sea
   surface temperature and plankton distribution patterns. A basking shark
   equipped with a special UHF radio transmitter was tracked for 17 days off
   the West Coast of Scotland using the ARGOS satellite data collection and
   location system. The shark surfaced during warm sunny weather and its
   movements were rather localised. Swimming speed was estimated as 0.106
   body lengths per second between locations on successive satellite orbits.
   Simultaneous infrared imagery using the NOAA 7 AVHRR indicated the
   shark's movements relative to sea surface temperature variations. This
   preliminary experiment clearly demonstrates the feasibility of
   satellite-based monitoring of movements of marine animals using currently
   available operational satellite systems.

   light chain somatic mutants, 338 constitute 2–4 bp stretches of adjacent
   changes. An absence of mutations in perinatal sequences and the bias for
   one mutating V gene in adults suggest that the diversification is antigen
   dependent. The substitutions shared no patterns, and the absence of donor
   sequences, including from family members, supports the idea that most
   changes arose from nontemplated mutation. The tandem mutations as a group
   are distinguished by consistently fewer transition changes and an A bias.
   We suggest this is one of several pathways of hypermutation diversifying

AB This study tests the hypothesis that preparatory, expansive, compressive

   anamniotes are conserved among extant elasmobranch fishes. The feeding
   mechanism of the lemon shark Negaprion brevirostris is examined by
   anatomical dissection, electromyography and high-speed video analysis.
   Three types of feeding events are differentiated during feeding: (1) food
   ingestion primarily by ram feeding; (2) food manipulation; and (3)
   hydraulic transport of the food by suction. All feeding events are
   composed of the expansive, compressive and recovery phases common to
   aquatically feeding teleost fishes, salamanders and turtles. A
   preparatory phase is occasionally observed during ingestion bites, and
   there is no fast opening phase characteristic of some aquatically feeding
   vertebrates. During the compressive phase, palatoquadrate protrusion
   accounts for 26 % of the gape distance during jaw closure and is
   concurrent with muscle activity in the dorsal and ventral preorbitalis
   and the levator palatoquadrati. Hydraulic transport events are shorter in
   duration than ram ingestion bites. Prey ingestion, manipulation and
   hydraulic transport events are all found to have a common series of
   kinematic and motor components. Individual sharks are capable of varying
   the duration and to a lesser extent the onset of muscle activity and,
   consequently, can vary their biting behavior. We propose a model for the
   feeding mechanism in carcharhinid sharks, including upper jaw protrusion.
   This study represents the first electromyographic and kinematic analysis
   of the feeding mechanism and behavior of an elasmobranch. Summary

   juveniles were identified from length-frequency plots and assigned ages
   based on a theoretical birth date of 1 October and their date of capture.
   A Schnute generalised growth model fitted to the combined vertebral and
   0+ data described the growth patterns best. Shortfin makos grow very
   rapidly initially, increasing by ∼39 cm fork length in their first year.
   Thereafter, males and females grow at similar but slower rates until
   about age 7 years, after which the relative growth of males declines.
   Longevity estimates were 29 and 28 years for males and females
   respectively. Natural mortality (M) is probably in the range of

AB To investigate patterns of polyandry in the sandbar shark (Carcharhinus
   plumbeus), 20 pregnant females were sampled from the western North
   Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico. Five species-specific microsatellite markers
   were used to genotype each shark and its litter. Of 20 litters, 17 (85%)
   were shown to have multiple sires. In multiply sired litters, the
   estimated minimum number of sires ranged from two to five with an average
   of 2.3 males per litter. Regression analysis did not demonstrate a
   significant relationship between female reproductive success and female
   body size or sire number and female body size. There was a high incidence
   of reproductive skew noted in litters, and two groups of males with
   significantly different mean reproductive success were observed. Analyses
   using Bateman's principles suggest that there is less direct benefit for
   females that acquire multiple mates than for males who bias paternity
   within litters. In light of past morphological and behavioural studies,
   these data suggest that patterns of polyandry in elasmobranchs may be
   determined by coercive mating, and that breeding behaviour has likely
   evolved in the context of sexual conflict.

   fast swimming sharks intrigue researchers since its low-drag riblet
   structure is applicable to many engineering applications. In this study,
   riblet-lined closed channel (rectangular duct) internal flow was examined
   since its effect is less understood than with open channel external flow.
   With one experimental setup and two fluids, this study examines various
   dimensional aspects of microstructured riblets. Experimental parameters
   include riblet geometry, fluid velocity (laminar and turbulent flow),
   fluid viscosity, riblet combinations, channel size, wettability, and
   scalability. For direct comparison, the sample flow channel was
   fabricated to accommodate multiple samples with water and air in various
   flow conditions, where drag is characterized by measuring pressure drop.
   Results are discussed and conceptual models are shown suggesting the

AB Cartilaginous fish (e.g., sharks) are derived from the oldest vertebrate
   ancestor having an adaptive immune system, and thus are key models for
   examining MHC evolution. Previously, family studies in two shark species
   showed that classical class I ( UAA ) and class II genes are genetically
   linked. In this study, we show that proteasome genes LMP2 and LMP7 ,
   shark-specific LMP7-like , and the TAP1/2 genes are linked to class I/II.
   Functional LMP7 and LMP7-like genes, as well as multiple LMP2 genes or
   gene fragments, are found only in some sharks, suggesting that different
   sets of peptides might be generated depending upon inherited MHC
   haplotypes. Cosmid clones bearing the MHC-linked classical class I genes
   were isolated and shown to contain proteasome gene fragments. A
   non-MHC-linked LMP7 gene also was identified on another cosmid, but only
   two exons of this gene were detected, closely linked to a class I
   pseudogene ( UAA-NC2 ); this region probably resulted from a recent
   duplication and translocation from the functional MHC. Tight linkage of
   proteasome and class I genes, in comparison with gene organizations of
   other vertebrates, suggests a primordial MHC organization. Another
   nonclassical class I gene ( UAA-NC1 ) was detected that is linked neither
   to MHC nor to UAA-NC2 ; its high level of sequence similarity to UAA
   suggests that UAA-NC1 also was recently derived from UAA and translocated
   from MHC. These data further support the principle of a primordial class
   I region with few class I genes. Finally, multiple paternities in one
   family were demonstrated, with potential segregation distortions.

AB Shark Bay is an 8000 sq. km shallow marine embayment on the western coast
   of Western Australia. The waters exhibit a well established salinity
   gradient from oceanic to hypersaline. The chemical assemblage of sediment
   hydrocarbons along the salinity gradient may be classified into two
   distinct chemogeographic types. Firstly, oceanic sediments contain
   n-alkanes and a suite of highly branched and branched/cyclic C25 alkenes.
   Hypersaline sediments are characterised by a high relative abundance of a
   C25H50 alkene together with an analogous C20H40 alkene and its parent
   C20H42 alkene (2,6,10-trimethyl-7-(3-methylbutyl)-dodecane). A pair of
   alkanes C21H42 and C22H44 increase in concentration and relative
   abundance with depth. The hydrocarbons of the hypersaline basins are
   found in only trace amounts in oceanic sediments. These chemical signals
   are overlain by further input indicative of the immediate biotic
   community.

AB Broadnose sevengill sharks Notorynchus cepedianus caught in a
   recreational fishery during a 3 yr period in Anegada Bay, Argentina were
   examined. Monthly variations in abundance were found, with the highest
   mean abundance in April. Neonates and juveniles were common in the study
   area, indicating that Anegada Bay is a nursery area of N. cepedianus.
   Male and female sizes at maturity were 170 and 224 cm total length (TL),
   respectively, similar to other studied regions. Liver size was sexually
   dimorphic, with adult females having larger livers, which might allow for
   the max- imization of oocyte size/number. Individuals 170 cm fed mostly
   on carti- laginous fishes and marine mammals. All size groups preyed on
   marine mammals, which may be a result of the local availability of small
   calves of La Plata River dolphins Pontoporia blainvillei. Possi- bly, the
   pattern of habitat use of Anegada Bay by P. blainvillei is affected by N.
   cepedianus. The pro- portion of individuals with prey within the stomach
   was negatively correlated with TL. As indicated by prey remains found
   within stomachs (most were in pieces) and by the location of the fishing
   hook in sharks (most were hooked in the mouth), N. cepedianus extensively
   handles its prey with the mouth before swallowing it, which is consistent
   with previous observations. Anegada Bay may be an important area for
   conservation of N. cepedianus in the SW Atlantic given the high abundance
   of juveniles and subadults.

AB The waters around Bimini (25° 43.70′ N, 79° 18.00′ W) provide an ideal
   nursery location for juvenile lemon sharks, Negaprion brevirostris, but
   this habitat is threatened by the development of a large resort. Since
   1999 the North Sound (NS) has been subjected to intermittent periods of
   dredging, the most intensive of which was in March 2001. Possible effects
   from the development up to June 2006 were investigated by: comparing
   growth rates of juvenile lemon sharks in the NS, Sharkland (SL) and South
   Bimini (SB) nurseries between 1995-2005 using before-after,
   control-impact (BACI) analysis; analyzing survival of juvenile lemon
   sharks in the NS and SL between 1995–2006; and by comparing habitat
   structures in the NS and SB nurseries in 2003 and 2005. BACI analysis
   detected no statistically significant difference between the growth rates
   of juvenile lemon sharks in the three nurseries before and after the
   impact date of March 2001. However, a reduction in the survival rate of
   juvenile lemon sharks in the NS after March 2001 was statistically
   significant, including a 23.5% decline in first-year survival. Habitat
   structure of the NS in 2003 and 2005 also varied with the mean percentage
   cover of the seagrass Thalassia testudinum declining by 17.7% since 2003.
   Our results indicate a correlation between the development thus far and a
   decline in the survival rates of juvenile lemon sharks and changes in the
   habitat structure of the NS. To elucidate further information regarding
   potential effects of the resort development on juvenile lemon sharks in
   the NS nursery, we suggest several future research directions.

AB A dynamic pool simulation model is derived and applied to the gummy shark
   stock of the southern shark fishery. Inputs to the model are fishing
   effort reported by fishers for hooks and for gill-nets with mesh sizes of
   6 inches (152 mm), 7 inches (178 mm) and 8 inches (203 mm) along with
   estimates for growth, natural mortality, catchability, hook and gill-net
   mesh selectivity, size at maturity and fecundity of females, sex ratio at
   birth, and length-weight relationships. Growth is described by the von
   Bertalanffy equation; hook selectivity is constant with length for sharks
   recruited to the fishery; gill-net selectivity is based on the
   probability density distribution of the gamma function where selectivity
   varies with the mesh size of the gill-nets and the length of the sharks;
   number of births is related to the proportion of females mature at each
   length, and the relationship between number of births and maternal weight
   is linear; parturition is annual and time is standardized so that
   parturition occurs at the beginning of each year; sex ratio at birth is
   based on observations of a I: I sex ratio of embryos; and allometric
   weight-length is based on the power curve. Natural mortality of recruits,
   catchability, reproduction and growth parameters are held constant, but
   density-dependent natural mortality of pre-recruits is varied in
   proportion to stock abundance. The model is used to si mulate effects of
   historical longline fishing effort and gill-net fishing effort for each
   mesh size on stock biomass, numbers of sharks in the stock, and numbers
   of births. The performance of the model is evaluated by comparing
   simulated annual catches and the simulated mean weight of sharks captured
   with annual catches reported by the fishers and the mean weight of sharks
   sampled in commercial landings. Uncertainties surrounding estimates of
   some of the parameters are discussed. Notwithstanding its shortcomings,
   the model indicates that the stock of gummy shark has been severely
   reduced and is in danger of further depletion unless immediate action is
   taken to reduce the commercial catch.

   examples of freshwater adaptation by elasmobranchs, the bull shark,
   Carcharhinus leucas, and the largetooth sawfish, Pristis perotteti. The
   bull shark is heavily concentrated around the river mouth and reproduces
   along the coast. The sparser population in the lake is recruited almost
   entirely through upstream movements from the lower river. Relatively
   heavy, year round commercial fishing around the river mouth since the
   late 1960's has sharply reduced the shark population in the lake. Since
   the shark fishery is primarily in Costa Rican waters, control and
   management can be effected only by a cooperative agreement between Costa
   Rica and Nicaragua, which has not yet been reached. The sawfish lives and
   reproduces primarily in the lake, where until 1970 a heavy concentration
   occurred, with relatively few being found in the lower river. Since 1970
   heavy commercial fishing for sawfish has been carried on in Lake

AB The results of the various studies describing the mechanism involved in
   pore formation by pardaxin and some of its analogues, support a
   ‘barrel-stave’ model (Ehrenstein amd Lecar, 1977). In this model pardaxin
   exerts its activity via three successive steps: (i) a fast binding step
   (as reflected by the rapid increase of NBD fluorescence in the presence
   of vesicles); (ii) insertion of peptides into the lipid bilayer; and
   (iii) the monomers aggregate into a barrel-like formation in which a
   central aqueous pore surrounded by proteins is formed. This pore
   increases in diameter through the progressive recruitment of additional
   monomers. Both the fluorescence energy transfer (FET) studies and the
   observation of a significant difference in the increase of NBD
   fluorescence, depending on which terminal was labelled by the
   fluorophore, support a model by which aggregates are formed in an ordered
   parallel manner, where the C-terminus is more exposed to the aqueous

   transport. Antibodies to mammalian ANP do not recognize the prohormone of
   marine species. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to isolate a
   partial cDNA encoding the shark heart natriuretic peptide. Using this
   partial sequence as a probe, the full-length clone [882 base pairs (bp)]
   was obtained from a shark heart cDNA library. Amino acids 119-135 are
   similar to the recently identified peptide sequences of porcine C-type
   natriuretic peptide (CNP) and killifish brain natriuretic peptide
   isolated from the brain of these species. Mature shark heart CNP
   terminates at the second cysteine residue and lacks a COOH-terminal
   extension, in contrast to cardiac ANP-like peptides of all other species.
   The primary amino acid sequence of the shark heart prepro-CNP is
   distinctly different from all other cardiac natriuretic peptides.
   Amplification of genomic DNA spanning the coding region produced a 1.5-kb
   product, indicating the presence of at least one intron. Sequencing
   confirmed the presence of two exons of 90 and 315 bp, separated by a

   Vertebral sections of 156 males (173.8–310 cm TL) and 80 females
   (185.5–283 cm TL) were analysed. The index of average percentage error
   (IAPE) ranged from 0 to 3.1% for 3–12 growth rings (GRs). Mean marginal
   increment (MI) decreased from November to January without, however,
   conclusively confirm the annual pattern of deposition. Growth parameters
   were derived using the von Bertalanffy growth function (VBGF), the
   Richards function and the Schnute function. VBGF was that which best fit
   the data. Parameters derived from back-calculated lengths, K = 0.157, L∞
   = 352.1 cm and t0 =− 1.01 year, were considered to best describe growth.
   First maturity sizes of 225 cm for males and 228 cm for females
   corresponded to 5-GRs individuals. A 310-cm male had 12 GRs which was the
   highest number in the entire sample. Growth rates of 33.9 cm per GR were
   estimated from birth to the first band corresponding to 60.2% of size at
   birth, which is 56.4 cm. Adult males were 90.5% of the entire male sample
   and, adult females corresponded to 79.6% of the sample of females. The
   male sample was composed of individuals from 3 to >11 GRs and females
   were 3 to 10 GRs. Males were larger (with higher number of GRs) and
   outnumbered females in the overall sample, as commonly occurs in catches
   worldwide. Despite the hypothesis of differential growth by sex,
   postulated by several authors, the present study demonstrated that growth
   curves did not differ significantly, even considering significant

AB Abstract Until recently little has been known about the common, pelagic
   shark, Pterolamiops longimanus . Data gathered during recent offshore
   cruises show it to be abundant and widely distributed in the warm waters
   of the western North Atlantic. It occurs at a wide range of salinities
   but withdraws from some waters when the temperature gets as low as about
   21°C. It is rarely present in water shallower than about 100 fathoms. In
   a sample of 110 sharks few were over 250 cm in total length, although the
   maximum size reported in the literature is much longer. Fish and
   cephalopods are the most frequent food items in white-tip stomachs.
   White-tips are cautious, persistent, and sluggish in their behaviour.
   They are responsible for considerable damage to long line caught tuna in
   the Gulf of Mexico. Geographical sexual segregation is a feature of
   white-tip life history. Fragmentary data indicate that the mating and
   pupping season is in the late spring or early summer and that the
   gestation period is about one year. Females probably first mate at a
   length of about 200 cm, and probably bear young in alternate years
   thereafter. The number of pups per litter varies from 2 to 9 with a mean
   of about 6. Shark suckers ( Remora remora ), pilotfish ( Naucrates ductor
   ), dolphin ( Coryphaena hippurus ) and a copepod parasite or parasites
   are common associates of the white-tip.

AB Whales are mammals and warm-blooded, sharks are fish and in the main
   cold-blooded. But in order to survive in the cold waters of the north
   Pacific Ocean, the salmon shark has become endothermic, maintaining a
   core body temperature that is higher than the surroundings, presumably a
   good move for animals that are continuously swimming. A study of salmon
   shark musculature shows that it is so specialized for endothermy that the
   red, aerobic muscles used for continuous swimming are remarkably
   mammal-like, functioning only within a narrow, elevated temperature
   range. These muscles are ineffectual if exposed to cool water, though the
   white muscles used for burst swimming work well in the cold. The red
   aerobic muscles in this shark mark it out from ‘ectothermic’ fish and are
   an evolutionary convergence with similarly endothermic tunas, and it
   seems that they have both edged towards mammals in the muscle stakes.
   Effects of temperature on muscle contraction and powering movement are
   profound, outwardly obvious, and of great consequence to survival1,2. To
   cope with the effects of environmental temperature fluctuations,
   endothermic birds and mammals maintain a relatively warm and constant
   body temperature, whereas most fishes and other vertebrates are
   ectothermic and conform to their thermal niche, compromising performance
   at colder temperatures2,3. However, within the fishes the tunas and
   lamnid sharks deviate from the ectothermic strategy, maintaining elevated
   core body temperatures4,5 that presumably confer physiological advantages
   for their roles as fast and continuously swimming pelagic predators. Here
   we show that the salmon shark, a lamnid inhabiting cold, north Pacific
   waters, has become so specialized for endothermy that its red, aerobic,
   locomotor muscles, which power continuous swimming, seem mammal-like,
   functioning only within a markedly elevated temperature range (20–30 °C).
   These muscles are ineffectual if exposed to the cool water temperatures,
   and when warmed even 10 °C above ambient they still produce only 25–50%
   of the power produced at 26 °C. In contrast, the white muscles, powering
   burst swimming, do not show such a marked thermal dependence and work
   well across a wide range of temperatures.

AB Loss of sharks and other upper-trophic marine predators has sparked
   worldwide concern for the stability of ocean ecosystems. The grey nurse
   (ragged-tooth or sand tiger) shark (Carcharias taurus) is Vulnerable on a
   global scale, Critically Endangered in Australia and presumed extinct in
   parts of its historical range. We used 193 muscle and fin samples
   collected from six extant populations to assess global mtDNA and
   microsatellite diversity and the degree of global population genetic
   structure. Control region mtDNA diversity was low in every population,
   and two populations (eastern Australia and Japan) contained only a single
   mtDNA haplotype. Genetic signatures of recent losses of genetic variation
   were not yet apparent at microsatellite loci, indicating that this low
   mtDNA variation is not a result of anthropogenic population declines.
   Population differentiation was substantial between each population pair
   except Brazil and South Africa, FST values ranged from 0.050 to 0.699 and
   0.100 to 1.00 for microsatellite and mitochondrial data respectively.
   Bayesian analysis clearly partitioned individuals into five of the
   populations from which they were sampled. Our data imply a low frequency
   of immigrant exchange among each of these regions and we suggest that
   each be recognized as a distinct evolutionary significant unit. In
   contrast to pelagic species such as whale shark and white shark that may
   cross ocean basins and where cooperative international efforts are
   necessary for conservation, grey nurse shark, like many coastal species,
   need to be managed regionally.

   antarctica had maximum production in summer, coincident with high light
   intensities and temperatures, whereas P. australis showed no clear
   seasonal pattern. Both species had maximum specific growth rates in
   summer. There were fluctuations in plant tissue concentrations of
   nitrogen and phosphorus, but standing-stock values for total nitrogen and
   total phosphorus were relatively constant in the meadows. Amounts of
   nutrients incorporated into new growth were 49.7 mg total nitrogen and
   3.6 mg total phosphorus m−2 day−1 for A. antarctica, and 25.6 mg total
   nitrogen and 4.3 mg total phosphorus m−2 day−1 for P. australis. The
   dominance of A. antarctica in Shark Bay, a nutrient-poor environment, is
   reflected in its higher productivity and this may be related to its more

AB The increasing presence of aquaculture in coastal waters calls for a
   better understanding of its environmental effects. Currently little
   information is available on the impact of shellfish farms on cetaceans.
   Here we compare long-term ranging patterns of adult female bottlenose
   dolphins (Tursiops sp. in Shark Bay, Western Australia) before and during
   full-scale pearl oyster farming operations, to determine if they were
   displaced. When the exact location of the oyster farm was determined, the
   dolphins decreased their use of that area after the farm was in place.
   Tracks of adult female dolphin movement near the oyster farm were
   compared to tracks of dolphin movement near an ecologically similar area
   where no oyster farm existed. Tracks near the oyster farm were less
   likely to enter the oyster farm itself than tracks near an ecologically
   similar location. This suggests that shellfish aquaculture could have a
   large impact on small cetaceans. The analytical techniques discussed
   apply broadly to aquatic and terrestrial animals.

AB In keeping with the proliferation of free software development
   initiatives and the increased interest in the business process management
   domain, many open source workflow and business process management systems
   have appeared during the last few years and are now under active
   development. This upsurge gives rise to two important questions: What are
   the capabilities of these systems? and How do they compare to each other
   and to their closed source counterparts? In other words: What is the
   state-of-the-art in the area?. To gain an insight into these questions,
   we have conducted an in-depth analysis of three of the major open source
   workflow management systems - jBPM, OpenWFE, and Enhydra Shark, the
   results of which are reported here. This analysis is based on the
   workflow patterns framework and provides a continuation of the series of
   evaluations performed using the same framework on closed source systems,
   business process modelling languages, and web-service composition
   standards. The results from evaluations of the three open source systems
   are compared with each other and also with the results from evaluations
   of three representative closed source systems: Staffware, WebSphere MQ,
   and Oracle BPEL PM. The overall conclusion is that open source systems
   are targeted more toward developers rather than business analysts. They
   generally provide less support for the patterns than closed source
   systems, particularly with respect to the resource perspective, i.e. the
   various ways in which work is distributed amongst business users and

AB Abstract The Na-K-Cl cotransporter mediates the coupled transport of Na,
   K, and Cl across the plasma membrane of many animal cell membranes. It is
   inhibited by loop diuretics such as furosemide, bumetanide, and
   benzmetanide. We have developed a panel of monoclonal antibodies directed
   against the 195-kDa shark rectal gland Na-K-Cl cotransport protein. Four
   representative antibodies (J3, J4, J7, and J25), each of which recognizes
   a discrete structural domain, were selected for detailed
   characterization. When a radiolabeled loop diuretic is bound to the
   cotransporter prior to solubilization, each antibody immunoprecipitates
   the same diuretic-protein complex. Of the four antibodies, J4 favors the
   native protein over the denatured one and does not bind well to
   proteolytic fragments; in contrast, J7 recognizes the cotransporter only
   after it has been solubilized. J3, J7, and J25 each recognize a unique
   ensemble of proteolytic fragments of the 195-kDa protein; analysis of the
   patterns of recognition has yielded a tentative assignment of the
   approximate location of the epitopes within the peptide. When the
   cotransport protein is treated with N-glycanase to remove N-linked
   oligosaccharides, its apparent mass decreases to approximately 135 kDa.
   The deglycosylated form is recognized by each of the antibodies except
   J25; this suggests that the J25 epitope is within the oligosaccharide
   component or in a peptide domain whose folding is disturbed by
   carbohydrate removal. An immunoaffinity matrix constructed with the J4
   antibody permits single-step purification of the 195-kDa protein; other
   proteins copurify with the large glycoprotein, but none of these appear
   to be subunits of a stoichiometric complex. The amino acid sequence of
   four fragments of the 195-kDa cotransport protein is reported.
   Immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy demonstrates, in
   agreement with physiological evidence, that the 195-kDa protein is
   distributed along the basolateral membrane and excluded from the apical
   membrane of the rectal gland secretory cell.

AB Retinofugal pathways in the spotted dogfish Scyliorhinus canicula and the
   thornback ray Raja clavata were studied with reduced silver techniques
   following unilateral eye enucleations. Optic nerve axons decussate in the
   chiasma opticum, except for a small ipsilateral projection to the area
   preoptica. After crossing, retinal projections distribute to the area
   preoptica, the thalamus dorsalis pars lateralis, the thalamus ventralis
   pars lateralis, the corpus geniculatum laterale, the nucleus pretectalis,
   and the superficial layers of the tectum mesencephali. In Scyliorhinus
   most primary optic fibers terminate in the stratum medullare externum of
   the mesencephalic tectum, while in Raja the zona externa of the stratum
   cellulare externum receives the bulk of the retinal input. A basal optic
   tract could be identified in Raja, but not in Scyliorhinus. The
   retinofugal pathways of the two species studied are compared with those
   of other cartilaginous fishes and other anamniotes. It is concluded that
   the primary visual system in chondrichthyans resembles that of
   actinopterygians and amphibians. However, there is a striking difference
   in the way in which the primary optic fibers reach the tectal target
   areas. In elasmobranch fish the optic nerve fibers enter the tectum
   through the zona interna of the stratum cellulare externum and send their
   axons into the more superficial tectal layers, while in actinopterygians
   and amphibians the majority of the optic fibers enter the tectum through
   the superficial layer and distribute their axons to deeper tectal layers.

AB Catch records from the Hawai'i Cooperative Shark Research and Control
   Program, which operated in Hawai'i from 1967–1969, were examined and data
   on the Galapagos shark,Carcharhinus galapagensis were analyzed. A total
   of 304 Galapagos sharks was caught, predominantly with longlines. More
   female sharks were caught than males, and the catch was skewed
   geographically. On the island of O'ahu the highest catch rates occurred
   along the north and south coasts. High catch rates also occurred near
   points of land, where longshore currents converge. Average depth of
   capture was greater for juveniles (45.1 m) and mature males (60.2 m),
   than for subadults (38.8 m) and mature female sharks (34.2 m). Males
   appear to reach maturity between 205 and 239 cm total length, and females
   between 215 and 245 cm. Litter size ranged from 4 to 16 pups, with an
   average of 8.7. In Hawaiian waters Galapagos sharks are born at just over
   80 cm total length. Mating and parturition apparently occur early in the
   year, and gestation is estimated to be about 12 months. Stomach contents
   consisted mainly of teleosts and benthic prey, and ontogenetic changes in
   diet occurred as sharks increased in size. Sharks consumed a smaller
   proportion of teleosts and more elasmobranchs with increasing size.
   Dietary diversity also increased with increasing size of shark.

AB Abstract The hypothesis of the `Phenomenon of Apparent Change in Growth
   Rate' caused by length-selective fishing mortality is adopted for
   explaining observed differences in published von Bertalanffy growth
   curves for gummy shark ( Mustelus antarcticus ) determined from
   length-at-age data. Three independent pieces of evidence are presented in
   support of this hypothesis to explain the differences in the curves
   between 1973–76 and 1986–87 in Bass Strait and between Bass Strait and
   South Australia during 1986–87: (1) Mean length of the sharks in each of
   the ages-classes 3–7 years are shown to be different between the two
   periods and the two regions, but not different for the 2-year age-class
   which is affected less than the older age-classes by the fishing gear
   deployed in the fishery. (2) Avoiding the pitfalls of `back-calculation',
   Rosa Lee's Phenomenon was detected by directly comparing the radii of
   growth-increment bands visible on the faces of the articular cups of
   vertebral centra from sharks of various ages caught in the two periods
   and the two regions. Statistical tests indicated that the degree of Rosa
   Lee's Phenomenon did not vary significantly between the periods or
   regions. (3) Through development of an appropriate model, the effects of
   length-selective fishing mortality on the mean length of sharks in the
   wild population for age-classes 2–16 years were simulated for a range of
   levels of hook and gillnet fishing effort, with separate mesh-sizes of 6
   and 7 in. for the gillnets. Simulated changes in mean length for sharks
   older than two years tended to be smaller than the differences observed
   in the published von Bertalanffy growth curves but they were generally
   consistent with the observed trends. The simulations demonstrated how the
   magnitude of the von Bertalanffy growth parameters L ∞ and t 0 tend to
   increase and K tends to decrease as gillnet fishing effort increases, and
   hence explain how these types of biases, commonly appearing in the
   scientific literature for gillnet shark fisheries, can occur. The
   simulations also demonstrate that hook fishing effort in a fishery with
   legal minimum lengths has to be very high to cause distortion of growth
   curves.

AB Card Shark and Thespis are two newly-implemented hypertext systems for
   creating hypertext narrative. Both systems depart dramatically from the
   tools currently popular for writing hypertext fiction, and these
   departures may help distinguish between the intrinsic nature of hypertext
   and the tendencies of particular software tools and formalisms. The
   implementation of these systems raises interesting questions about
   assumptions underlying recent discussion of immersive, interactive

AB Substantial ecological, economic and social problems result from shark
   interactions in pelagic longline fisheries. Improved understanding of
   industry attitudes and practices towards shark interactions assists with
   managing these problems. Information on fisher knowledge and new
   strategies for shark avoidance may benefit sharks and fishers. A study of
   12 pelagic longline fisheries from eight countries shows that incentives
   to avoid sharks vary along a continuum, based on whether sharks represent
   an economic disadvantage or advantage. Shark avoidance practices are
   limited, including avoiding certain areas, moving when shark interaction
   rates are high, using fish instead of squid for bait and deeper setting.
   Some conventionally employed fishing gear and methods used to target
   non-shark species contribute to shark avoidance. Shark repellents hold
   promise; more research and development is needed. Development of
   specifically designed equipment to discard sharks could improve shark
   post release survival prospects, reduce gear loss and improve crew
   safety. With expanding exploitation of sharks for fins and meat, improved
   data collection, monitoring and precautionary shark management measures
   are needed to ensure shark fishing mortality levels are sustainable.

   collected from surface gillnetters operating off northeastern Brazil and
   throughout the southwestern equatorial Atlantic Ocean between January and
   December 1996. A common regression for TL and eviscerated weight (EW) was
   calculated as, log EW = −11.786 + 2.889 log TL. Females and males were
   categorised into reproductive stages (4 and 2, respectively) according to
   morphological changes in their gonads. Size at sexual maturity for
   females was estimated to be 240 cm, while males appeared to mature at
   between 180 and 200 cm. Gravid females had between 2 and 21 embryos or
   pups, varying in TL from 3 to 38 cm. There was no relationship between
   maternal length and size of litter. Copulation and parturition appear to
   occur outside the sampled area and possibly closer to the coast. With the
   exception of slightly lower uterine and ovarian fecundities, the results
   support the few existing data on the reproductive cycle of S. lewini in
   other areas.

AB The hydrologic regime of Shark Slough, the most extensive long
   hydroperiod marsh in Everglades National Park, is largely controlled by
   the location, volume, and timing of water delivered to it through several
   control structures from Water Conservation Areas north of the Park. Where
   natural or anthropogenic barriers to water flow are present, water
   management practices in this highly regulated system may result in an
   uneven distribution of water in the marsh, which may impact regional
   vegetation patterns. In this paper, we use data from 569 sampling
   locations along five cross-Slough transects to examine regional
   vegetation distribution, and to test and describe the association of
   marsh vegetation with several hydrologic and edaphic parameters. Analysis
   of vegetation:environment relationships yielded estimates of both mean
   and variance in soil depth, as well as annual hydroperiod, mean water
   depth, and 30-day maximum water depth within each cover type during the
   1990's. We found that rank abundances of the three major marsh cover
   types (Tall Sawgrass, Sparse Sawgrass, and Spikerush Marsh) were
   identical in all portions of Shark Slough, but regional trends in the
   relative abundance of individual communities were present. Analysis also
   indicated clear and consistent differences in the hydrologic regime of
   three marsh cover types, with hydroperiod and water depths increasing in
   the order Tall Sawgrass < Sparse Sawgrass < Spikerush Marsh. In contrast,
   soil depth decreased in the same order. Locally, these differences were
   quite subtle; within a management unit of Shark Slough, mean annual
   values for the two water depth parameters varied less than 15 cm among
   types, and hydroperiods varied by 65 days or less. More significantly,
   regional variation in hydrology equaled or exceeded the variation
   attributable to cover type within a small area. For instance, estimated
   hydroperiods for Tall Sawgrass in Northern Shark Slough were longer than
   for Spikerush Marsh in any of the other regions. Although some of this
   regional variation may reflect a natural gradient within the Slough, a
   large proportion is the result of compartmentalization due to current
   water management practices within the marsh. We conclude that hydroperiod
   or water depth are the most important influences on vegetation within
   management units, and attribute larger scale differences in vegetation
   pattern to the interactions among soil development, hydrology and fire
   regime in this pivotal portion of Everglades.

AB The tiger shark (Galeocerdo cuvier Peron and Lesueur 1822) is a widely
   distributed predator with a broad diet and the potential to affect marine
   community structure, yet information on local patterns of abundance for
   this species is lacking. Tiger shark catch data were gathered over 7
   years of tag and release research fishing (1991–2000, 2002–2004) in Shark
   Bay, Western Australia (25°45′S, 113°44′E). Sharks were caught using
   drumlines deployed in six permanent zones (~3 km2 in area). Fishing
   effort was standardized across days and months, and catch rates on hooks
   were expressed as the number of sharks caught h−1. A total of 449
   individual tiger sharks was captured; 29 were recaptured. Tiger shark
   catch rate showed seasonal periodicity, being higher during the warm
   season (Sep–May) than during the cold season (Jun–Aug), and was marked by
   inter-annual variability. The most striking feature of the catch data was
   a consistent pattern of slow, continuous variation within each year from
   a peak during the height of the warm season (February) to a trough in the
   cold season (July). Annual growth rates of recaptured individuals were
   generally consistent with estimates from other regions, but exceeded
   those for populations elsewhere for sharks >275 cm fork length (FL),
   perhaps because mature sharks in the study area rely heavily on large
   prey. The data suggest that (1) the threat of predation faced by animals
   consumed by tiger sharks fluctuates dramatically within and between
   years, and (2) efforts to monitor large shark abundance should be
   extensive enough to detect inter-annual variation and sufficiently
   intensive to account for intra-annual trends.

AB The fission–fusion society of bottlenose dolphins seems particularly well
   suited to balancing the costs and benefits of grouping. Here, we examined
   four nonmutually exclusive hypotheses regarding the causes and/or
   functions of calf grouping patterns when with and away from the mother:
   maternal influence, same-sex bond formation, protection and social skill
   development. We evaluated the role of calf (calf sex, age and separation
   from their mothers) and maternal characteristics (foraging time and
   sociality) in shaping the size and composition of mother–calf groups
   using focal observations of 49 mothers and 89 calves. Mother–calf groups
   were biased towards association with females of all ages and with male
   calves, but contained relatively few juvenile and adult males. Although
   there was some support for all of the hypotheses, the social skills
   hypothesis best explained male calf social patterns, and maternal
   influence better explained female calf social patterns. While maternal
   sociality influenced calves of both sexes, daughters mirrored the mother
   during separations, whereas sons did the opposite, seeking more social
   contact if their mothers were solitary and seeking less social contact if
   their mothers were sociable. During mother–calf separations, calves of
   both sexes preferentially associated with immatures over adults, but male
   calves preferred juvenile and adult male associates, which female calves,
   like their mothers, avoided. Calf social patterns illustrate the specific
   social and ecological challenges that they face in relation to and
   independent of their mothers.

AB Eleven of 23 sharks tested attacked a fish model from beneath a

   cues. Head-on approaches by the model elicited a higher frequency of
   attacks and shorter attack latencies than caudal approaches (frequency, P
   = 0.04; latency, P = 0.03). Night attacks may have been facilitated by
   turbulence-generated bioluminescence. Resting sharks and vacated
   depressions were usually adjacent to reefs, either facing or aligned
   parallel to margins of nearby reefs, and oriented toward upslope
   directions. Four sharks that were identified based on natural pigment
   patterns returned to the near proximities (< 3 m) of previously occupied
   ambush sites. Based on our experiments and observations, we suggest that
   (1) prey movement sensed visually is the most important cue for eliciting
   daytime attacks, (2) the sharks probably possess an anterodorsally
   directed field of vision, and (3) ambush sites are selected based on
   substrata characteristics likely to be associated with prey availability.

AB : The classical (CCP) and alternative (ACP) pathways of complement
   activation have been established for the nurse shark (Ginglymostoma
   cirratum). The isolation of a cDNA clone encoding a mannan-binding
   protein-associated serine protease (MASP)-1-like protein from the
   Japanese dogfish (Triakis scyllia) suggests the presence of a lectin
   pathway. The CCP consists of six functionally distinct components: C1n,
   C2n, C3n, C4n, C8n and C9n, and is activated by immune complexes in the
   presence of Ca++ and Mg++ ions. The ACP is antibody independent,
   requiring Mg++ ions and a heat-labile 90 kDa factor B-like protein for
   activity. Proteins considered homologues of C1q, C3 and C4 (C2n) of the
   mammalian complement system have been isolated from nurse shark serum.
   Shark C1q is composed of at least two chain types each showing 50%
   identity to human C1q chains A and B. Partial sequence of the globular
   domain of one of the chains shows it to be C1q-like rather than like
   mannan-binding protein. N-terminal amino acid sequences of the alpha and
   beta chain of shark C3 and C4 molecules show significant identity with
   corresponding human C3 and C4 chains. A sequence representing shark C4
   gamma chain, shows little similarity to human C4 gamma chain. The
   terminal shark components C8n and C9n are functional analogues of
   mammalian C8 and C9. Anaphylatoxin activity has been demonstrated in
   activated shark serum, and porcine C5a desArg induces shark leucocyte
   chemotaxis. The deduced amino acid sequence of a partial C3 cDNA clone
   from the nurse shark shows 50%, 30% and 24% homology with the
   corresponding region of mammalian C3, C4 and alpha 2-macroglobulin.
   Deduced amino acid sequence data from partial Bf/C2 cDNA clones, two from
   the nurse shark and one from the Japanese dogfish, suggest that at least
   one species of elasmobranch has two distinct Bf/C2 genes.

   were found to reach maturity at between 55-60 cm total length (TL) and
   female sharks mature around 55 cm TL. Blood samples collected from mature
   male and female sharks were analyzed for sex steroid hor- mones to
   examine seasonal hormone patterns. Plasma samples were analyzed via
   radioimmu- noassay techniques with female samples measured for estradiol,
   progesterone, and androgen concentrations, and male samples measured for
   androgen concentrations. Male androgen concen- trations showed a single
   broad peak from July to October with maximum hormone concentrations (60
   ng/ml) occurring in August. Male androgen concentrations were lowest in
   December-February (<20 ng/ml), and appeared to correlate with
   reproductive activity and water temperature. Female androgen
   concentrations were an order of magnitude lower than those for males and
   showed peaks in June (6 ng/ml) and December (8 ng/ml). Estradiol
   concentrations in females peaked during the months of September-November
   (0.5 ng/ml) coinciding with the egg laying period. Progesterone
   concentrations ranged up to 0.5 ng/ml prior to the mating season.
   Observations of ova size and egg production showed eggs develop in pairs
   and ova are ovulated at a size of 25-27 mm. Females lay eggs from August
   to January. Males were observed with swollen claspers from July through
   De- cember, with the highest amount of sperm storage in the epididymis
   occurring between August through November. Our observations indicate that
   epaulette sharks in the waters near Heron Island mate from July through

AB Several halophilic archaea belonging to the genus Halococcus were
   isolated from stromatolites from Hamelin Pool, Shark Bay, Western
   Australia, collected during field trips in 1996 and 2002. This is the
   first incidence of halophilic archaea being isolated from this
   environment. Stromatolites are biosedimentary structures that have been
   formed throughout the earth's evolutionary history and have been
   preserved in the geological record for over 3 billion years. The
   stromatolites from Hamelin Pool, Western Australia, are the only known
   example of extant stromatolites forming in hypersaline coastal
   environments. Based on their 16S rRNA gene sequences and morphology, the
   isolates belong to the genus Halococcus. Strain 100NA1, isolated from
   stromatolites collected in 2002, was closely related to strain 100A6T
   that was isolated from the stromatolites collected in 1996, with a
   DNA–DNA hybridization value of 94±8 %. DNA–DNA hybridization values of
   strain 100A6T with Halococcus morrhuae NRC 16008 and Halococcus
   saccharolyticus ATCC 49257T were 17±6 and 11±7 %, respectively. The DNA
   G+C content of strain 100A6T was 60.5 mol% (T m). The main polar lipid
   was S-DGA-1, a sulphated glycolipid that has been detected in all strains
   of the genus Halococcus. Whole-cell protein profiles, enzyme composition
   and utilization of various carbon sources were distinct from those of all
   previously characterized Halococcus species. The recognition of this
   strain as representing a novel species within the genus Halococcus is
   justified, and the name Halococcus hamelinensis sp. nov. is proposed. The
   type strain is 100A6T (=JCM 12892T=ACM 5227T).

AB Tiger Shark is a scalable, parallel file system designed to support
   interactive multimedia applications, particularly large-scale ones such
   as interactive television (ITV). Tiger Shark runs under the IBM AIX®
   operating system, on machines ranging from RS/6000TM desktop workstations
   to the SP2® parallel supercomputer. In addition to supporting
   continuous-time data, Tiger Shark provides scalability, high
   availability, and on-line system management, all of which are crucial in
   large-scale video servers. These latter features also enable Tiger Shark
   to support nonmultimedia uses, such as scientific computing, data mining,
   digital library, and scalable network file servers. Tiger Shark has been
   employed in a number of customer ITV trials. On the basis of experience
   obtained from these trials, Tiger Shark has recently been released in
   several IBM video-server products. This paper describes the architecture
   and implementation of Tiger Shark, discusses the experience gained from
   trials, and compares Tiger Shark to other scalable video servers.

AB This study focused on the Shark River estuary in the central drainage of
   the Everglades watershed, testing whether mangrove subsidies to estuarine
   food webs were especially strong in south Florida sites, as suggested in
   pioneering studies by Odum and Heald (1975). Samples of red mangroves
   (Rhizophora mangle L.) and filter feeding barnacles and mussels were
   collected in a transect from the mouth of the estuary to the freshwater
   end of the estuary during August 1997. Along this transect, elemental and
   stable isotopic compositions of green, yellow and submerged detrital
   mangrove leaves showed relatively constant carbon (C) compositions, while
   nitrogen (N) and sulfur (S) compositions varied strongly. For example,
   mangrove N contents increased at the upper freshwater end of the Shark
   River estuary, and N isotopic compositions declined, probably indicating
   relatively N-rich inputs from the upstream Everglades watershed. In
   contrast, mangrove sulfur contents varied most in mid-estuary where green
   leaf S contents were highest and S isotopic compositions lowest. Mixing
   models based on S isotopes showed that mangrove swamps supported up to
   60% of filter feeder nutrition at mid-estuarine stations. However,
   microalgal support of the filter feeders was also generally strong
   (40-75%) throughout the estuary. Although this study did not confirm a
   dominant nutritional role for mangrove detritus at most sites, results
   did support a second hypothesis from earlier work in this area (Odum,
   1984), namely that landscape position may generally control development
   of mangrove-based food webs.

AB Skeletal remains of Tristychius arcuatus commonly occur in ironstone
   nodules from the Scottish Upper and Lower Oil Shale Groups. This material
   is clearly distinguishable from the small shark from Glencartholm
   described by Traquair, Woodward and Moy-Thomas under this name. Study of
   the latter shows that its finspines are distinctly different from the
   holotype of T. arcuatus and, therefore, it has been renamed. Tristychius
   arcuatus sensu stricto is a medium-sized hybodont shark with a short
   gape, a functionally heterocercal tail and narrow-based, tribasal
   pectoral fins. Its most unusual feature is a well developed opercular
   gill cover composed of long hyoid rays. Evidence suggests that this
   character was present in several Palaeozoic sharks, although it is absent
   in all Recent elasmobranchs. It is not clear whether it was primitively
   present in chondrichthyans or evolved separately in several lineages.
   Hybodonts and ctenacanths are recognised as separate, specialised shark
   radiations, neither of which can be directly ancestral to Recent sharks.
   Of the two, hybodonts appear to be more closely related to Recent forms,
   although the presence of typical hybodont finspines in Tristychius
   arcuatus indicates that they had diverged from ancestral euselachians
   before the beginning of the Carboniferous.

AB The third in a series of five-yearly aerial surveys for dugongs in Shark
   Bay, Ningaloo Reef and Exmouth Gulf was conducted in July 1999. The first
   two surveys provided evidence of an apparently stable population of
   dugongs, with similar to 1000 animals in each of Exmouth Gulf and
   Ningaloo Reef, and 10000 in Shark Bay. We report estimates of less than
   200 for each of Exmouth Gulf and Ningaloo Reef and similar to 14000 for
   Shark Bay. This is an apparent overall increase in the dugong population
   over this whole region, but with a distributional shift of animals to the
   south. The most plausible hypothesis to account for a large component of
   this apparent population shift is that animals in Exmouth Gulf and
   Ningaloo Reef moved to Shark Bay, most likely after Tropical Cyclone
   Vance impacted available dugong forage in the northern habitat. Bias
   associated with survey estimate methodology, and normal changes in
   population demographics may also have contributed to the change. The
   movement of large numbers of dugongs over the scale we suggest has
   important management implications. First, such habitat-driven shifts in
   regional abundance will need to be incorporated in assessing the
   effectiveness of marine protected areas that aim to protect dugongs and
   their habitat. Second, in circumstances where aerial surveys are used to
   estimate relative trends in abundance of dugongs, animal movements of the
   type we propose could lead to errors in interpretation.

   shark, is described from the uppermost part of the Gearle Siltstone in
   the Giralia Anticline, Southern Carnarvon Basin, Western Australia. The
   material represents a new genus and species: Cardabiodon ricki . The
   taxon is referred to the new family Cardabiodontidae on the basis of its
   dental formula and uniquely oversized lower lateroposterior teeth. Other
   characteristic features include a strong dignathic heterodonty and the
   presence of four anterior and approximately 14 lateroposterior toothfiles
   in both the upper and lower jaw. The size of the recovered vertebral
   centra indicates that the shark measured at least 5 m in total length.
   The species had a wide but possibly patchy distribution with additional
   occurrences in England and Kazakstan, where it is present in strata of
   Cenomanian age. Cardabiodon shares several key dental characters with
   Parotodus , known from Oligocene–Pliocene deposits. The latter taxon was
   previously grouped with the ‘mega-toothed’ sharks of the genera Otodus
   and Carcharocles , but is here reassigned to the Cardabiodontidae. The
   nominal species Cretalamna woodwardi from the middle or late Cenomanian
   of southern England, is designated as the type species of the new genus
   Dwardius . The coeval nominal species Pseudoisurus tomosus from the
   Saratov region in Russia, is based on material that almost certainly
   includes C. ricki and/or D. woodwardi . Designation of a lectotype for P.
   tomosus and its proper documentation would probably allow either C. ricki
   or D. woodwardi to be synonomised with the older name P. tomosus . There
   is, however, a strong possibility that the syntypes of P. tomosus are
   lost. Until they are found, redescribed and compared carefully with the
   type material of C. ricki and D. woodwardi, P. tomosus is a name of

AB Mustelus antarcticus, endemic to southern Australia, exhibits
   matrotrophic aplacental viviparity. Differences in synchronous ovarian
   and parturition cycles, mostly annual west and biennial east of longitude
   138°E, are explained by environmental differences. Ovulation and
   parturition peak during November–December and the gestation period is ~12
   months. Largest ovarian follicle diameter ranges from 15 to 28 mm at
   ovulation, and mean wet mass gain is 10-fold from in utero egg (~10 g) to
   full-term embryo (~100 g) at ~330 mm total length. The sex ratio of
   embryos in utero is 1:1, and litter size (1 to 57 embryos) rises
   curvilinearly with maternal length. Length-at-maternity and
   length-at-maturity increased with rising fishing mortality and
   subsequently decreased with falling fishing mortality. These patterns are
   explained by the hypothesis on the ‘phenomenon of apparent change of
   size-at-maternity’ (and size-at-maturity) caused by gill-net
   length-selective fishing mortality, which masks any potential
   density-dependent responses. Male length-at-maturity estimates from
   seminal vesicle condition, testis development and spermatogenesis stages
   are similar, but are less than estimates from clasper calcification.
   Maximum body mass of females is double that of males and, at any length
   >700 mm, mean body mass of females exceeds that of males.

PY 2003
AB The life history and population dynamics of the finetooth shark
   (Carcharhinus isodon) in the north-eastern Gulf of Mexico were studied by
   determining age, growth, size-at-maturity, natural mortality,
   productivity, and elasticity of vital rates of the population. The von
   Bertalanffy growth model was estimated as Lt=1559 mm TL (1–e–0.24
   (t+2.07)) for females and Lt = 1337 mm TL (1–e–0.41 (t+1.39)) for males.
   For comparison, the Fabens growth equation was also fitted separately to
   observed size-at-age data, and the fits to the data were found to be
   similar. The oldest aged specimens were 8.0 and 8.1 yr, and theoretical
   longevity estimates were 14.4 and 8.5 yr for females and males,
   respectively. Median length at maturity was 1187 and 1230 mm TL,
   equivalent to 3.9 and 4.3 yr for males and females, respectively. Two
   scenarios, based on the results of the two equations used to describe
   growth, were considered for population modeling and the results were
   similar. Annual rates of survivorship estimated through five methods
   ranged from 0.850/yr to 0.607/yr for scenario 1 and from 0.840/yr to
   0.590/yr for scenario 2. Productivities were 0.041/yr for scenario 1 and
   0.038/yr for scenario 2 when the population level that produces maximum
   sustain-able yield is assumed to occur at an instantaneous total
   mortality rate (Z) equaling 1.5 M, and were 0.071/yr and 0.067/yr, when
   Z=2 M for scenario 1 and 2, respectively. Mean generation time was 6.96
   yr and 6.34 yr for scenarios 1 and 2, respectively. Elasticities
   calculated through simulation of Leslie matrices averaged 12.6% (12.1%
   for scenario 2) for fertility, 47.7% (46.2% for scenario 2) for juvenile
   survival, and 39.7% (41.6% for scenario 2) for adult survival. In all,
   the finetooth shark exhibits life-history and population characteristics
   intermediate to those of sharks in the small coastal complex and those
   from some large coastal species, such as the blacktip shark (Carcharhinus

   abilities, raising questions about field studies showing attraction of
   sharks to acoustic signals. By extrapolating the particle acceleration

AB Individual mammals have the capacity to express at least one million
   distinct antigen binding specificities, implying a high degree of
   structural heterogeneity in the variable heavy and light chain (VH and
   VL) portions of the antibody molecules. Studies of higher vertebrate
   species suggest that this heterogeneity is created both through a
   sizeable repertoire of germ-line VH and VL genes1 and through random
   rearrangements of V and joining genes2–4. Additional somatic mechanisms
   probably also contribute to the ultimate heterogeneity; one-third of
   murine plas-macytomas producing λ1 immunoglobulin carry a somatically
   mutated Ig1-V gene5,6. The relative contributions of these various
   mechanisms to the overall immunoglobulin variability are difficult to
   evaluate. The production of different antibodies to a defined determinant
   in different individuals of an inbred mouse strain [for example,
   (3-iodo-4-hydroxy-5-nitrophenyl) acetyl (NIP) in CBA mice7] suggests the
   involvement of somatic mutations or rearrangement but does not rule out
   the possibility that each individual CB A mouse expresses only a small
   random fraction from a large germ-line repertoire of V genes determining
   different anti-NIP binding sites. The opposite finding, that different
   individuals produce nearly identical antibodies to a defined determinant,
   would suggest the presence and expression of a limited number of
   germ-line genes without somatic alterations. Data presented here suggest
   that primitive sharks (Heterodontus fransisci)8 produce such antibodies
   to the hapten furyloxazolone.

   and C. plumbeus populations off the west coast of Australia by resampling
   the input parameters for life tables from empirical biological data
   collected from commercial target fisheries and fishery-independent
   surveys. The models were used to examine the effects of multiple
   scenarios of age-specific survival, derived from the fishing mortality
   rates estimated from a tagging study on sharks and indirect estimates of
   natural mortality. In the absence of fishing, median estimates of the
   rates of intrinsic population increase (r) were 0.025 for both species.
   Inclusion of the age-specific fishing mortality rates estimated for C.
   obscurus recruits born in 1994 and 1995 resulted in the median estimates
   of r declining to 0.007 and 0.012, respectively, suggesting that recent
   harvest levels of mainly neonates by the target fishery were probably
   sustainable. However, the model also suggested that the population was
   more susceptible to exploitation of older sharks than was previously
   believed. The C. plumbeus model indicated that fishing mortality between
   2001 and 2004 was probably unsustainable. The increasingly negative trend
   in median r estimates (from -0.032 to -0.049), and the population's
   apparently limited capacity for density-dependent compensation through
   changes in fecundity, somatic growth and longevity, suggests that
   management intervention is necessary to prevent continued stock
   depletion.

AB For over a decade, we have been studying the reproductive behavior of the
   nurse shark, Ginglymostoma cirratum, in the Dry Torugas off the Florida
   Keys, an important mating and nursery ground for this species. In the
   course of these studies, we have used a variety of tags and tagging
   protocols to monitor individual animals. Here we report the use of
   molecular methods for the genetic analysis of nurse sharks. Specifically
   we have analyzed genetic variation at the MHC II alpha locus using the
   polymerase chain reaction (PCR) followed by restriction fragment length
   polymorphism (RFLP) analysis of the amplified products. We found this
   technique to be a relatively rapid and reliable method for identifying
   genetic differences between individual sharks. Applying this method to a
   family of sharks consisting of a mother and 32 pups, we demonstrate that
   at least four fathers must have fathered this brood. Multiple paternity
   in the nurse shark suggests a mechanism by which populations of this
   species may maximize genetic variability. This seems especially valuable
   for philopatric species whose migratory movement, and thus potential for
   genetic diversity, is limited.

AB Studies on the feeding behaviour of large predatory sharks are inherently
   problematic because of the size of the animals, the difficulty in
   observing and handling them and the risks to the investigator.
   Observations on the feeding behaviour of the sevengill shark Notorynchus
   cepedianus over a seven-year period revealed this species to display at
   least four distinct foraging strategies. A particular strategy, or a
   combination of two or more, was employed depending on the size and type
   of prey being subdued. The four primary factors that appear to influence
   prey selection were prey size, availability and density, and scavenging.
   The behaviour of a prey species influences the predator's foraging and
   hunting behaviour. The success of the sevengill shark as an apical
   predator can be attributed, in part, to the feeding strategies it employs
   to subdue prey.

AB Abstract The distribution, nature and extent of microbial deposits in
   Hamelin Pool, Shark Bay have been investigated and mapped with emphasis
   on the occurrence, external morphologies, internal fabrics,
   constructional mechanisms, microbial communities, growth rates and
   sediment associations in the intertidal and previously little researched
   subtidal zone. Detailed georeferenced substrate mapping revealed
   extensive subtidal microbial deposits occupying approximately 300 km 2 of
   the total Holocene 1400 km 2 area of Hamelin Pool. The Microbial Pavement
   covers 227 km 2 of the subtidal substrate that together with columnar
   structures reveals a subtidal microbial habitat which occupies an area 10
   times larger than the area of the intertidal deposits. Microbial
   carbonate is composed of aragonite (80–98%) that reveals high positive
   values of δ 13 C (+ 4.46 to + 5.88) and δ 18 O (+ 3.06 to + 3.88) as a
   characteristic of the highly evaporative environment with extensive
   microbial activity. Oldest dated heads are 1915 and 1680 14 C years BP,
   and the overall system was deposited in two stages; the first between
   2000 and 1200 and the last from 900 years BP to the present. Slow growth
   rates vary from less than 0.1 mm/year to 0.5 mm/year. Different internal
   fabrics were constructed according to their position in relation to the
   littoral zone by distinct microbial communities, and lateral fabric
   relations have been established. Evidence of shallowing-upward fabric
   sequences of microbial origin reflects relative falling sea levels during
   the late Holocene and is likely useful in ancient environmental
   interpretation. A sequence of events and mechanisms are described
   emphasizing differences between the stromatolitic, thrombolitic and
   cryptomicrobial deposits in Shark Bay. The new substrate map and
   depositional history for this distinctive and peculiar microbial habitat
   establish the significance of subtidal structures and emphasize the
   geoscientific importance of Hamelin Pool, especially with respect to
   early life studies and ancient analogues for understanding microbial
   activity, deposit characteristics, fenestral fabrics and distribution.

   found to be higher (206 g) than tuna and rohu skin gelatins (177 g and
   124 g, respectively). Similarly, molecular weight, viscosity, melting

   clarity of dog shark gelatin were in general better than the tuna and
   rohu skin gelatins. The amino acid analysis showed that hydroxyproline
   content in dog shark skin gelatin was the highest when compared to tuna

AB Swimming with whale sharks has become popular in the waters of Ningaloo
   Marine Park, Western Australia, since 1993. The Park is one of very few
   known and accessible places in the world where whale sharks congregate on
   a regular and predictable basis. Consumers' willingness to pay (WTP) to
   participate in the whale shark experience, and their willingness to
   contribute financially to the management of the resource might be
   important to the long-term sustainability of the industry. The Western
   Australian Department of Conservation and Land Management levies tourist
   operators A$15 per passenger per day, and uses the funds collected for
   research, management and education about whale sharks. Surveys were
   undertaken to determine the willingness of participants to pay for their
   whale shark experience and to pay the levy. WTP for the experience was
   slightly below the amounts actually paid, while Japanese tourists
   indicated a lower WTP than did other tourists. Respondents indicated WTP
   a significantly higher levy than is presently charged (t = -10.99, p <
   0.05). In a loglinear analysis the only significant effect on WTP the
   levy was ethnicity (Pearson chi-square = 16.2473, p < 0.05), with
   Japanese tourists again signalling a lower WTP than other groups. It is
   concluded that tourists are willing, via the payment of a transparent
   'access fee', to contribute to the costs of sustainable management of the
   whale shark experience.

AB Over-exploitation of whale sharks threatens the future of these
   wide-ranging pelagic fish. A long-term continuous record (4436 sightings)
   from a large aggregation (300–500 resident individuals) of whale sharks
   at Ningaloo Reef, Western Australia shows that mean shark length declined
   linearly by nearly 2.0 m and relative abundance measured from ecotourism
   sightings (corrected for variation in search effort and environmental
   stochasticity) has fallen by approximately 40% over the last decade. This
   population-level result confirms previous predictions of population
   decline based on projection models parameterised using mark-recapture
   estimates of survival. The majority of these changes are driven by
   reductions in the number of large individuals in the population.
   Phenomenological time series models support a deterministic (extrinsic)
   decline in large females, although there was some evidence for density
   dependence in large males. These reductions have occurred despite the
   total protection of whale sharks in Australian waters. As this species is
   highly migratory, the rapid change in population composition over a
   decade (<1 whale shark generation) supports the hypothesis of
   unsustainable mortality in other parts of their range (e.g.,
   overfishing), rather than the alternative of long-term abiotic or biotic
   shifts in the environment. As such, effective conservation of whale
   sharks will require international protection, and collaborative tagging
   studies to identify and monitor migratory pathways.

AB The western barred bandicoot was reintroduced to the Australian mainland
   in 1995 after an absence of at least 60 years. The new population was
   derived from 14 animals, reintroduced to Heirisson Prong from Dorre
   Island in Shark Bay, Western Australia. Introduced predators (the
   European red fox and the feral cat) were controlled at the reintroduction
   site, but European rabbits were not. A large fenced area of natural
   vegetation within the reintroduction site was used as a secure refuge
   from mammalian predators. Bandicoots were released from this predator
   refuge to the 12 km2 conservation site. Dispersal from the point of free
   release was minimal. The reintroduced population has persisted for 4
   years and increased, with at least 175 bandicoots recruited to the
   population in this time. The recapture rate of marked bandicoots was low,
   suggesting that adult mortality was high. Reproductive output at
   Heirisson Prong appeared greater than that of the two surviving wild
   populations on Bernier and Dorre Islands. Litter size was similar, but
   there was an extended annual breeding season at the reintroduction site.
   Body condition of reintroduced and wild bandicoots were similar, although
   there was some indication that reintroduced males may have been in poorer
   condition than their island counterparts. The litter size of bandicoots
   increased with a decrease in rabbit abundance, however, bandicoots were
   able to reproduce, maintain condition, and sustain recruitment to allow
   the population to increase despite the presence of rabbits. Two fox
   incursions occurred during the 4-year period of establishment, and feral
   cats were present on occasion in low numbers. Feral cats may be
   responsible for a lower rate of population increase than that observed on
   predator-free Dorre Island. Ongoing predator control is essential for any
   mainland reintroduction of bandicoots.

AB Predators can play important roles in structuring their communities
   through topdown effects on the distribution and abundance of their prey.
   Sharks are top predators in many marine communities, yet few studies have
   quantified those factors influencing their distribution and hunting
   behaviour. Here, we use location data from 340 predatory interactions
   between white sharks Carcharodon carcharias (Linnaeus), and Cape fur
   seals Arctocephalus pusillus pusillus (Schreber), data on associated
   environmental factors, and spatial analysis, including a novel
   application of geographic profiling – a tool originally developed to
   analyse serial crime – to investigate spatial patterns of shark attack
   and search behaviour at Seal Island in False Bay, South Africa. We found
   that spatial patterns of shark predation at this site are nonrandom.
   Sharks appear to possess a well-defined search base or anchor point,
   located 100 m seaward of the seal’s primary island entry–exit point. This
   location is not where chances of intercepting seals are greatest and we
   propose it may represent a balance among prey detection, capture rates,
   and competition. Smaller sharks exhibit more dispersed prey search
   patterns and have lower predatory success rates than larger conspecifics,
   suggesting possible refinement of hunting strategy with experience or
   competitive exclusion of smaller sharks from the most profitable hunting
   locations. As many of the features of this system will be common to other
   instances of foraging, our conclusions and approach employed may have
   implications and applications for understanding how large predators hunt
   and for studying other predator–prey systems.

AB Oceanic whitetip sharks (Carcharhinus longimanus) have recently been
   targeted for conservation in the western North Atlantic following severe
   declines in abundance. Pop-up satellite archival tags were applied to 11
   mature oceanic whitetips (10 females, 1 male) near Cat Island in the
   central Bahamas 1–8 May 2011 to provide information about the horizontal
   and vertical movements of this species. Another large female was
   opportunistically tagged in the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). Data
   from 1,563 total tracking days and 1,142,598 combined depth and
   temperature readings were obtained. Sharks tagged at Cat Island stayed
   within 500 km of the tagging site for ∼30 days before dispersing across
   16,422 km2 of the western North Atlantic. Maximum individual displacement
   from the tagging site ranged from 290–1940 km after times at liberty from
   30–245 days, with individuals moving to several different destinations
   (the northern Lesser Antilles, the northern Bahamas, and north of the
   Windward Passage). Many sharks returned to The Bahamas after ∼150 days.
   Estimated residency times within The Bahamas EEZ, where longlining and
   commercial trade of sharks is illegal, were generally high (mean = 68.2%
   of time). Sharks spent 99.7% of their time shallower than 200 m and did
   not exhibit differences in day and night mean depths. There was a
   positive correlation between daily sea surface temperature and mean depth
   occupied, suggesting possible behavioral thermoregulation. All
   individuals made short duration (mean = 13.06 minutes) dives into the
   mesopelagic zone (down to 1082 m and 7.75°C), which occurred
   significantly more often at night. Ascent rates during these dives were
   significantly slower than descent rates, suggesting that these dives are
   for foraging. The sharks tracked appear to be most vulnerable to pelagic
   fishing gear deployed from 0–125 m depths, which they may encounter from
   June to October after leaving the protected waters of The Bahamas EEZ.

AB Abstract In Na,K-ATPase membrane preparations from shark rectal glands,
   we have previously identified an FXYD domain-containing protein,
   phospholemman-like protein from shark, PLMS. This protein was shown to
   associate and modulate shark Na,K-ATPase activity in vitro. Here we
   describe the complete coding sequence, expression, and cellular
   localization of PLMS in the rectal gland of the shark Squalus acanthias.
   The mature protein contained 74 amino acids, including the N-terminal
   FXYD motif and a C-terminal protein kinase multisite phosphorylation
   motif. The sequence is preceded by a 20 amino acid candidate cleavable
   signal sequence. Immunogold labeling of the Na,K-ATPase α-subunit and
   PLMS showed the presence of α and PLMS in the basolateral membranes of
   the rectal gland cells and suggested their partial colocalization.
   Furthermore, through controlled proteolysis, the C terminus of PLMS
   containing the protein kinase phosphorylation domain can be specifically
   cleaved. Removal of this domain resulted in stimulation of maximal
   Na,K-ATPase activity, as well as several partial reactions. Both the E1∼P
   → E2-P reaction, which is partially rate-limiting in shark, and the K+
   deocclusion reaction, E2(K) → E1, are accelerated. The latter may explain
   the finding that the apparent Na+ affinity was increased by the specific
   C-terminal PLMS truncation. Thus, these data are consistent with a model
   where interaction of the phosphorylation domain of PLMS with the
   Na,K-ATPase α-subunit is important for the modulation of shark
   Na,K-ATPase activity.

   installation of shark nets in the 1960s, has reduced the incidence of
   shark attack considerably. Forty-four kilometres of permanently
   maintained nets catch an annual average of 1470 sharks and 536 other
   animals, which are largely dolphins, turtles and rays. The impact of
   netting on both the species caught and the inshore environment as a whole
   is not well understood and is a cause for concern. The release from the
   nets of live animals, including sharks, and the removal of nets during
   periods of highest catches may reduce such impact. Experiments with an
   increased mesh size are in progress. Tests of an electrical barrier as an
   alternative to nets have not been encouraging but are continuing. In the
   cooler waters to the south of Natal, where there are no shark nets, a
   marked increase in the number of shark attacks has taken place in recent
   years. There appear to be no plans to expand the netting operations into
   those waters.

TI DIEL BEHAVIOR OF THE BLUE SHARK, PRIONACE GLAUCA, NEAR SANTA CATALINA
   ISLAND, CALIFORNIA 1
PY 1977
AB The diel activity levels and movements of the blue shark, Prionaceglauca,
   were studied in the natural environment using ultrasonic telemetry. Two
   initial sharks were tagged with single-channel trans­ mitters equipped
   with depth sensors. Twelve sharks were tagged with multichannel
   transmitters with various combinations ofsensors to measure depth,
   swimming speed, swimming direction, and temper­ ature. From March to
   early June, the sharks made an evening-twilight migration from their
   epipelagic daytime habitat to the shallower waters bordering the island.
   Fromlate June to October, the sharks remainedoffshore throughout the day
   and night. This change in movementpattern is suggested to be in response
   to a seasonal shift in location ofprey. The telemetry data indicated that
   the blue shark is basically nocturnal, showing highest activity in the
   early evening and lowest activity in the early daylight morning. Measured
   parameters increasing at night included 1) rate ofhorizontal movement, 2)
   swimming speed, 3) variability in depth, and 4) variability in swimming
   direction. The sharks usually remained within a relatively narrow range
   of water temperatures. This paper describes a study in which the dieI
   activities of an epipelagic shark were monitored remotely in the natural
   environment. Multichan­ nel ultrasonic transmitters were used to
   telemeter certain behavioral and environmental parameters offree-ranging
   blue sharks, Prionaceglauca (Lin­ naeus). The primary objective was to
   track the sharks continuously throughout the day-night cycle to determine
   diel patterns of activity and movement. Prior to the initiation ofthis
   study, surprisingly little had been published on the behavior of the blue
   shark, one of the most abundant large pred­ ators in warm temperate seas.
   Bigelow and Schroeder (1948) summarized what was then known about the
   biology of the species. Suda (1953) studied embryonic development, size
   re­ lationsips, and sex ratios as related to distribution in the north
   tropical and subtropical Pacific. Strasburg (1958) investigated the
   distribution, abundance, capture depths, reproduction, and food habits
   ofpelagic sharks, including the blue shark, in the central Pacific.

AB Bycatch—the incidental catch of nontarget species—is a principal concern
   in marine conservation and fisheries management. In the eastern Pacific
   Ocean tuna fishery, a large fraction of nonmammal bycatch is captured by
   purse-seine gear when nets are deployed around floating objects. We
   examined the spatial distribution of a dominant species in this fishery's
   bycatch, the apex predator silky shark (Carcharhinus falciformis), from
   1994 to 2005 to determine whether spatial closures, areas where fishing
   is prohibited, might effectively reduce the bycatch of this species. We
   then identified candidate locations for fishery closures that
   specifically considered the trade-off between bycatch reduction and the
   loss of tuna catch and evaluated ancillary conservation benefits to less
   commonly captured taxa. Smoothed spatial distributions of silky shark
   bycatch did not indicate persistent small areas of especially high
   bycatch for any size class of shark over the 12-year period.
   Nevertheless, bycatch of small silky sharks (<90 cm total length) was
   consistently higher north of the equator during all years. On the basis
   of this distribution, we evaluated nearly 100 candidate closure areas
   between 5 ◦ Na nd 15 ◦ N that could have reduced, by as much as 33%, the
   total silky shark bycatch while compromising only 12% of the tuna catch.
   Although silky sharks are the predominant species of elasmobranchs caught
   as bycatch in this fishery, closures also suggested reductions in the
   bycatch of other vulnerable taxa, including other shark species and
   turtles. Our technique provides an effective method with which to balance
   the costs and benefits of conservation in fisheries management. Spatial
   closures are a viable management tool, but implementation should be
   preceded by careful consideration of the consequences of fishing
   reallocation.

AB The scalloped hammerhead, Sphryna lewini (Griffith & Smith, 1834), is a
   globally exploited species of shark. In order to gain insight into the
   life history of this species in the USA waters, age and growth was
   examined from specimens (n = 307) captured from the north-west Atlantic
   Ocean and from the Gulf of Mexico. The von Bertalanffy growth model
   resulted in growth parameters of L∞ = 214.8 cm fork length (FL), k = 0.13
   year–1, t0 = –1.62 year for males and L∞ = 233.1 cm FL, k = 0.09 year–1,
   t0 = –2.22 year for females. The oldest age estimates obtained for this
   population were 30.5 years for both males and females, which corresponded
   to FL of 234 cm and 241 cm respectively. Bowker’s test of symmetry and
   Index of Average Per Cent Error suggests that our ageing method
   represents a non-biased and precise approach to the age assessment.
   Marginal increments were significantly different between months
   (Kruskal–Wallis P = 0.017) with a distinct trend of increasing monthly
   increment growth beginning in January. When compared to previously
   published studies, our growth estimates suggest slower growth than
   populations in the Pacific Ocean but faster growth than previously
   reported in the Gulf of Mexico.

AB The Eocene rocks exposed in the Fayum Area, Egypt, are well known for
   their fossil vertebrates but in recent times the sharks and rays have
   been largely neglected. Extensive surface collecting, supplemented with
   bulk samples, has produced large collections from the Midawara, Gehannam,
   Birket Qarun and Qasr el-Sagha formations, spanning the Bartonian and
   Priabonian stages and from palaeoenvironments varying from open muddy
   shelf to very shallow estuarine systems. In total about 90 species of
   sharks and rays are recorded, many of them previously unrecognised,
   resulting in some of the most diverse fossil chondrichthyan assemblages
   known from the Tertiary. Teeth of these species suggest that they
   occupied a wide range of ecological niches from top predator to tiny
   benthic invertebrate feeder to planktivore. Many of the species are
   limited in their stratigraphical range and show potential to be used, at
   least locally, as biostratigraphical indicators for stratigraphically
   poorly constrained vertebrate sites elsewhere in North Africa. Distinctly
   different faunas from different sedimentary environments indicate a
   strong environmental control on the distribution of many species.

   Science, 64: 131-140.The reproductive ecology of Squatina guggenheim from
   two coastal areas in South America is analysed. In both sexes,
   individuals from ER (El Rincon coastal system, the more southern area)
   attained a larger maximum total length (L T ) and a heavier weight at a
   given length than those from LP (La Plata River estuary). Females from ER
   mature at a significantly larger L T than females from LP. These patterns
   could be explained by an advantage of larger body size at higher
   latitudes in providing more reserves for winter, because individuals from
   ER have a larger liver than those from LP. Spines in the outer part of
   the pectoral fins were observed only in adult males. Fecundity increased
   with female total length. Females have a 3-y reproductive cycle,
   consisting of 10-12 months of gestation and 2 y of oocyte maturation. The
   embryonic growth fits the Gompertz model. Birth is in November or
   December, as inferred from embryo size and the presence of neonates and
   young of the year. Densities of S. guggenheim in LP peaked in spring and
   summer along the Uruguayan coast, suggesting a seasonal movement
   perpendicular to the shore. The reproductive pattern found suggests a
   population with low productivity.

AB In an attempt to document the migratory pathways and the environmental
   conditions encountered by American eels during their oceanic migration to
   the Sargasso Sea, we tagged eight silver eels with miniature satellite
   pop-up tags during their migration from the St. Lawrence River in Quebec,
   Canada. Surprisingly, of the seven tags that successfully transmitted
   archived data, six were ingested by warm-gutted predators, as observed by
   a sudden increase in water temperature. Gut temperatures were in the
   range of 20 to 25°C—too cold for marine mammals but within the range of
   endothermic fish. In order to identify the eel predators, we compared
   their vertical migratory behavior with those of satellite-tagged
   porbeagle shark and bluefin tuna, the only endothermic fishes occurring
   non-marginally in the Gulf of St. Lawrence. We accurately distinguished
   between tuna and shark by using the behavioral criteria generated by
   comparing the diving behavior of these two species with those of our
   unknown predators. Depth profile characteristics of most eel predators
   more closely resembled those of sharks than those of tuna. During the
   first days following tagging, all eels remained in surface waters and did
   not exhibit diel vertical migrations. Three eels were eaten at this time.
   Two eels exhibited inverse diel vertical migrations (at surface during
   the day) during several days prior to predation. Four eels were eaten
   during daytime, whereas the two night-predation events occurred at full
   moon. Although tagging itself may contribute to increasing the eel's
   susceptibility to predation, we discuss evidence suggesting that
   predation of silver-stage American eels by porbeagle sharks may represent
   a significant source of mortality inside the Gulf of St. Lawrence and
   raises the possibility that eels may represent a reliable, predictable
   food resource for porbeagle sharks.

   formation, Shark, designed to be highly flexible and modular, allowing
   easy exploration of different physical processes and ways of modelling
   them. We introduce the philosophy behind Shark and provide an overview of
   the physical processes included in the model. Shark is written in C++11
   and has been parallelized with OpenMP. In the released version (v1.1), we
   implement several different models for gas cooling, active galactic
   nuclei, stellar and photo-ionisation feedback, and star formation (SF).
   We demonstrate the basic performance of Shark using the Planck15
   cosmology SURFS simulations, by comparing against a large set of
   observations, including: the stellar mass function (SMF) and stellar-halo
   mass relation at z=0-4; the cosmic evolution of the star formation rate
   density (SFRD), stellar mass, atomic and molecular hydrogen; local gas
   scaling relations; and structural galaxy properties, finding excellent
   agreement. Significant improvements over previous SAMs are seen in the
   mass-size relation for disks/bulges, the gas-stellar mass and stellar
   mass-metallicity relations. To illustrate the power of Shark in exploring
   the systematic effects of the galaxy formation modelling, we quantify how
   the scatter of the SF main sequence and the gas scaling relations changes
   with the adopted SF law, and the effect of the starbursts H$_2$ depletion
   timescale on the SFRD and $\Omega_{\rm H_2}$. We compare Shark with other
   SAMs and the hydrodynamical simulation EAGLE, and find that SAMs have a
   much higher halo baryon fractions due to large amounts of intra-halo gas,
   which in the case of EAGLE is in the intergalactic medium.

   chains remained absent, as in the control group, despite the prominence
   of C18:1 and C16:1 in shark liver oil. The treatment also resulted in an
   overall increase in the proportion of n −3 and n −6 polyunsaturated fatty
   acids in sperm lipids with a prominent increase of docosahexaenoic acid
   over time (18.9±1.34% at Day 0 to 25.7±1.11% at Day 28) and compared to
   control (25.7±1.11% for treated versus 16.1±0.81% for control at Day 28,

AB Publisher Summary The most impressive stromatolites are in the
   high-stress environments and their morphogenesis is controlled by
   physical processes. Smaller stromatolites and sheet-like cryptalgal
   deposits occur in settings of low stress, where morphogenesis is
   dominated by the biotic processes of the algae. The chapter makes it
   clear that the gross morphology of the stromatolites is not controlled by
   the type of algal mats. Smooth mat produces structures ranging from
   stratiform sheets to high–relief columns. The mat type controls
   theinternal fabric of the stromatolites, filamentous mats producing
   laminated structures and coccoid mats unlaminated ones. But even the
   distribution of mat types is ultimately related, as is the stromatolite
   morphology, to physical processes of the environment. This chapter
   presents some generalizations that are useful in interpreting the
   environment of ancient stromatolites.

AB Little is known of the diversity, demography, and essential fish habitat
   of sharks within the United States Virgin Islands (USVI) marine
   ecosystem. To examine species diversity and the relative abundance of
   elasmobranchs in this region, bottom-longline and hand-gear sampling was
   conducted in Fish Bay, St. John, USVI, from June 2004 to December 2005.
   In the 8 sampling trips during this period, 54 standardized longline sets
   caught 174 elasmobranchs comprising 5 species of sharks and 1 batoid.
   Overall catch per unit effort [ln(CPUE + 1) ± SE] was 1.83 ± 0.16
   elasmobranchs 100 hooks–1 h–1. Lemon sharks Negaprion brevirostris had
   the highest relative abundance based on log-transformed CPUE data (0.98 ±
   0.15), followed by blacktip sharks Carcharhinus limbatus (0.91 ± 0.18),
   southern stingrays Dasyatis americana (0.28 ± 0.08), nurse sharks
   Ginglymostoma cirratum (0.08 ± 0.05), blacknose sharks Carcharhinus
   acronotus (0.06 ± 0.04) and the Caribbean sharpnose Rhizoprionodon
   porosus (0.03 ± 0.03). The relative abundance of all species was
   significantly higher in the summer (2.6 ± 0.2) than during the winter
   (1.1 ± 0.2). For the blacktip (N = 89 captures of 74 individuals) and
   lemon (N = 66, 48 individuals) sharks, which comprised the bulk of the
   catch, mean fork length (± SE) was 51.9 ± 0.63 cm and 59.9 ± 1.2 cm,
   respectively, representing primarily neonatal and young-of-the-year life
   stages. The recapture rates for blacktip and lemon sharks were 21% and
   29%, respectively, and nearly all recaptures occurred within the bay,
   indicating a high degree of site fidelity. Capture information and
   limited acoustic tracking provided evidence of spatial and temporal
   habitat partitioning by these 2 shark species within the bay. Although
   the CPUE of both species was highest over shallow (<1 m) seagrass
   substrate, lemon sharks were found and tracked exclusively on shallow,
   mangrove-fringed seagrass habitat, while blacktip sharks utilized a wider
   area of the bay. Fish Bay was determined to provide important nursery
   habitat for young juvenile lemon and blacktip sharks in the USVI.

AB The non-target bycatch of sharks in pelagic longline (PLL) fisheries
   represents a potential source of compromise to shark populations
   worldwide. Moreover, shark bycatch and depredation (damage inflicted on
   gear, bait, and catch) complicates management of sharks and other
   species, and can undermine the operations and financial interests of the
   pelagic longline industry. Thus, deducing means to reduce shark
   interactions is in the best interest of multiple stakeholder groups.
   Prior to doing so, however, the extent, cause and effect of these
   interactions must be better understood. In this review we address or
   conduct the following in relation to the U.S. Atlantic, Gulf of Mexico
   and Caribbean PLL fishery: (1) U.S. management governing shark
   interactions in the Atlantic; (2) the primary species encountered and
   historical shark catch data associated with PLL fishing in the Atlantic;
   (3) a historical comparison of area-specific shark species catch records
   between the two primary sources of shark catch data in this fishery; (4)
   the conditions and dynamics that dictate shark interactions in this
   fishery, and potential means to reduce these interactions, and; (5) a
   synthesis of the estimated impacts of this fishery on shark populations
   relative to other fisheries in the Atlantic. As has been found in other
   PLL fisheries, the blue shark (Prionace glauca) is clearly the shark
   species most commonly encountered in this fishery in the Atlantic, and
   receives the majority of attention in this review. U.S. management areas
   with high relative shark species diversities had a greater divergence in
   historical shark species percent-compositions between data sources
   (Pelagic Observer Program versus mandatory pelagic Logbook databases);
   this complicates the ability to conclude which species are most impacted
   by PLL fishing in those areas. The current fishing effort by the U.S. PLL
   fleet is small compared to that of PLL fishing targeting sharks in the
   Atlantic by non-U.S. fleets, and therefore poses a comparatively lower
   threat to the stability of Atlantic shark populations. However,
   incidental shark encounters are inevitable in U.S. Atlantic PLL fishing
   operations. Thus, it is in the best interest of all stakeholders in the
   Atlantic to better understand the extent and conditions governing these
   interactions, and to explore methods to reduce both their occurrence and
   those aspects leading to higher rates of incidental shark mortality.

   in solid cartilaginous nasal capsules, which open at the ventral side of
   the snout and are entirely separate from the mouth. The olfactory rosette
   consists of two rows of lamellae arising from a central raphe. The
   lamellae possess secondary folds covered with sensory epithelium, which
   contains microvillous receptor cells, supporting cells with both cilia
   and microvilli, basal cells, and goblet cells. No ciliated receptor cells
   were found. Gaps between facing lamellae connect the inlet chamber with
   the outlet chamber. The inlet chamber receives the ventilatory water
   through the incurrent nostril and the outlet chamber discharges the water
   through the excurrent nostril. A nasal flap, a septum, and paired valve
   flaps form an incomplete barrier between incurrent and excurrent nostrils

AB ABSTRACT The inshore shoals of basking sharks that appear in spring off
   the western seabord of Europe have been variously claimed to be part of a
   seasonal south to north migration, or local, perhaps nuptial,
   aggregations. The decline in the catches of the Achill Island Fishery in
   the last decade suggests that the size of the shoals has diminished
   there. Size/frequency analysis of available records shows a midsummer
   peak of specimens with a mean length of 3.09 m and a mid-winter peak at
   3.52 m; the difference is significant and is ascribed to growth. From
   this value, coupled with the recorded maximum and minimum sizes, a
   hypothetical asymptotic growth-curve is calculated. Comparison of this
   age/length relationship with the observed relationship between length and
   the number of calcareous "rings" in the vertebral centra suggests that at
   birth there are seven rings in a precaudal vertebra and that two rings
   are added annually thereafter. This suggests a possible gestation period
   of 3.5 years. This in turn, leads to the expectation that, since pregnant
   (or gravid) females are almost or quite unknown, they must live a hidden,
   perhaps demersal, life for three consecutive years after their first
   mating. The size/frequency analysis shows that only three specimens, none
   of them females, have been recorded between 5.8 and 7.4 metres in length,
   which on the tentative growth curve, corresponds with fish of average
   size in their sixth, seventh and eighth years. The fishery catches,
   though probably insignificant in relation to the total population of the
   north-eastern Atlantic, would have a devastating effect on a local
   population of a fish with such a low reproductive rate. Thompson (1856)
   states that the western coasts of Ireland are much frequented by the
   sunfish (basking shark) which appears in March or April and stays until
   November. The Parliamentary Gazetteer of Ireland (Anon., 1846) refers to
   their sporadic appearance off the north-west coast but says

   sizes larger than those reported from northern Western Australia, the
   Northern Territory and far northern Queensland. Mating occurs annually in
   summer, and the gestation period is approximately 11.5 months. After
   development to a small blastodermic disc, the embryos enter a state of
   diapause that lasts approximately 7 months. R. taylori is the only

   The litter size ranges from 1 to 10 (mean 4.9, being markedly larger than
   that for other carcharhinid species of a similar size. The size at birth

AB Abstract The Sultanate of Oman has a long established traditional shark
   fishery, which has experienced increased demand in recent years due to
   the shark fin trade. Despite the long history of the fishery in Oman and
   neighbouring countries, few studies have been undertaken to determine the
   biological characteristics of the fishery or its ability to withstand
   this increased exploitation. The present study was undertaken as a first
   step to remedying this situation. A total of 47 species was confirmed
   from Oman's coastal waters, of which 44 occurred in commercial landings.
   However, landings were dominated by eight species—Rhizoprionodon acutus,
   Iago omanensis, Carcharhinus sorrah, Loxodon macrorhinus, C. macloti, C.
   limbatus, Sphyrna lewini and C. falciformis. The species composition of
   landings varied along the coast and also with season. Brillouin Index
   values indicated that species diversity was greatest in the Muscat area,
   followed closely by Musandam. The Al-Wusta region displayed the lowest
   diversity. The occurrence of two uncommon shark species, Chaenogaleus
   macrostoma and Echinorhinus brucus, was of interest, as was the recording
   of a juvenile Carcharhinus galapagensis, extending its northern range in
   the Indian Ocean considerably.

AB In order to gain insight into the evolution of the genetic control of the

   vertebrates, we cloned and analysed the spatiotemporal expression pattern
   of six transcription factor genes in a chondrichthyan, the shark
   Scyliorhinus canicula (lesser-spotted dogfish/catshark). As in other
   vertebrates, NeuroD is expressed in all cranial sensory ganglia. We show
   that Pax3 is expressed in the profundal placode and ganglion, strongly
   supporting homology between the separate profundal ganglion of
   elasmobranchs and basal actinopterygians and the ophthalmic trigeminal
   placode-derived neurons of the fused amniote trigeminal ganglion. We show
   that Pax2 is a conserved pan-gnathostome marker for epibranchial and otic
   placodes, and confirm that Phox2b is a conserved pan-gnathostome marker
   for epibranchial placode-derived neurons. We identify Eya4 as a novel
   marker for the lateral line system throughout its development, expressed
   in lateral line placodes, sensory ridges and migrating primordia,
   neuromasts and electroreceptors. We also identify Tbx3 as a specific
   marker for lateral line ganglia in shark embryos. We use the
   spatiotemporal expression pattern of these genes to characterise the
   development of neurogenic placodes and cranial sensory ganglia in the
   dogfish, with a focus on the epibranchial and lateral line placodes. Our
   findings demonstrate the evolutionary conservation across all
   gnathostomes of at least some of the transcription factor networks
   underlying neurogenic placode development.

AB Background As we know from modern species, nursery areas are essential
   shark habitats for vulnerable young. Nurseries are typically highly
   productive, shallow-water habitats that are characterized by the presence
   of juveniles and neonates. It has been suggested that in these areas,
   sharks can find ample food resources and protection from predators. Based
   on the fossil record, we know that the extinct Carcharocles megalodon was
   the biggest shark that ever lived. Previous proposed paleo-nursery areas
   for this species were based on the anecdotal presence of juvenile fossil
   teeth accompanied by fossil marine mammals. We now present the first
   definitive evidence of ancient nurseries for C. megalodon from the late
   Miocene of Panama, about 10 million years ago.

AB With increasing evidence of the destructive impacts of human activities
   on the ocean there is a growing call for stronger public engagement in
   marine governance. An understanding of marine issues and
   pro-environmental values are key elements that influence an individual׳s
   engagement in conservation and pro-environmental behaviour. This paper
   presents a study on public perceptions of sharks and shark conservation
   in the UK. The study investigated knowledge of and attitudes towards
   sharks of a group of individuals with a clear interest in the marine
   environment, as well as possible factors that might influence their
   perceptions of sharks, in order to make recommendations on how to foster
   engagement in shark conservation. The key finding was that important
   prerequisites for engagement in shark conservation exist among parts of
   the UK public. However, this does not seem to be enough to motivate
   actual engagement. The study discusses a number of specific challenges
   with regard to sharks which might be influencing the way in which society
   connects to shark related issues. It concludes with priority
   recommendations for further investigation into potential catalysts for
   public engagement in shark conservation.

   for sandbar shark (Carcharhinus plumbeus) blood, based on criteria
   established in human medicine, for the following tests: RBC count, total
   WBC count, PCV, hemoglobin (Hgb) concentration, and WBC differential
   percentages. Methods: Replicate CBCs were performed using blood samples
   from 5 captive sandbar sharks. Three protocols for RBC and total WBC
   counts were compared, as were different centrifugation times for PCV
   determination, and 2 methods for Hgb concentration. Means, minimum and
   maximum values, and CVs were compared to CAP and CLIA performance
   guidelines for human tests. Results: Total WBC counts in a diluent
   modified for elasmobranch blood, Hgb concentration by the
   cyanmethemoglobin method after removal of nuclei, and WBC differential
   percentages showed acceptable performance. PCV results were acceptable
   when tubes were centrifuged for at least 5 minutes. Total RBC counts by
   all 3 methods exceeded the acceptable error for manual counts of human
   cells. Conclusions: Standardized CBC tests can be used as health
   assessment tools for elasmobranchs. Total RBC counts should be viewed as
   estimates.

AB Analysis of stable isotopes of oxygen and carbon in the otolith carbonate
   of pink snapper, Pagrus auratus, from several locations in Shark Bay,
   Western Australia, indicated that snapper are highly location specific.
   The hypersaline (36 to >60‰) Shark Bay, on the coast of Western
   Australia, generated strongly characteristic isotopic signatures in the
   otolith carbonate of snapper collected from the various locations
   indicating low levels of individual movement of the species. Oxygen
   isotopes showed enrichment in 18O in otolith carbonate with salinity
   (0.10: Δ δ18O/Δ salinity ‰) typical for the evaporation of seawater. The
   enrichment in 13C (up to 1.75‰) was attributed to the incorporation of
   metabolically derived CO2 from an enrichment of 13C in the food web
   within Shark Bay. This was possibly a result of lower concentrations of
   dissolved CO2 with increasing salinity causing a reduction in isotope
   fractionation during photosynthesis. Results complement recent genetic
   and tagging studies and provide further evidence of the complex nature of
   snapper stock structure in the Shark Bay region.

AB SUMMARY Patterns of red muscle strain and activation were examined at
   three positions along the body (0.42, 0.61 and 0.72 L , where L is total
   body length) and correlated with simultaneous measurements of midline
   kinematics during steady swimming (approx. 1.0 L s –1 ) in the leopard
   shark Triakis semifasciata . Analysis of lateral displacement along the
   body indicates that the leopard shark is a subcarangiform swimmer.
   Longitudinal variation in red muscle strain was observed with strain
   amplitudes ranging from ±3.9% in the anterior,± 6.6% in the mid, to ±4.8%
   in the posterior body position. Strain was in-phase with local midline
   curvature. In addition, strain amplitude calculated from a bending beam
   model closely matched strain measured using sonomicrometry at all three
   body positions. There is a high degree of similarity in red muscle
   activation patterns along the body between the leopard shark and many
   fish species, in that the onset of activation occurs during muscle
   lengthening while offset occurs during muscle shortening. However, we
   found no significant longitudinal variation in the EMG/strain phase
   relationship and duty cycles, with onset of muscle activation occurring
   at 51.4–61.8° and offset at 159.7–165.2° (90° is peak length). This
   consistent pattern of activation suggests that red muscle along the
   entire length of the body contributes to positive power production. Thus,
   sharks such as Triakis may have no regional specialization in red muscle
   function like that seen in many teleosts, which may indicate that the
   evolution of differential muscle function along the body occurred after
   the divergence of cartilaginous and bony fishes.

AB ABSTRACT: Quantifying the diet of sympatric co-occurring predatory
   species is a challenging task, made more so when investigations attempt
   to focus on specific age groups. This is the task that confronts efforts
   to understand dietary resource partitioning among co-occurring juvenile
   shark species within nursery areas. Here, stable isotope analysis (δ13C
   and δ15N) is used to overcome these challenges in describing species
   dietary resource partitioning strategies within the communal shark
   nursery area of Cleveland Bay, Queensland, Australia. We analyzed the
   isotopic composition of 3 distinct tissues, (muscle, blood plasma, and
   red blood cells), for 7 species of shark and 3 species of large predatory
   teleost to investigate whether these communal areas support their diverse
   array of predators without the need for resource partitioning strategies.
   Clustered δ15N values for all examined species indicated feeding within
   the same trophic level; however, wide ranging δ13C values denoted
   exploitation of several primary carbon sources. Our results demonstrate
   inter-species resource partitioning strategies at work within the
   examined communal shark nursery, altering the previous interpretation of
   these areas as resource-rich and/or competition-limited environments.

AB The tiger shark (Galeocerdo cuvier) is the largest shark in the family
   Carcharhinidae and the only carcharhinid with aplacental viviparous
   (ovoviviparous) reproduction. Despite its size and prevalence, many
   details of tiger shark reproductive biology are unknown. Size at maturity
   and litter size have been reported by several authors, but a lack of
   large numbers of pregnant females has made it difficult to determine
   gestation period, seasonality, and timing of the female reproductive
   cycle. Here we analyze data from shark control program fishing and
   incidental catches in Hawaii (n = 318) to construct the most complete
   picture of tiger shark reproduction to date. Males reached maturity at
   approximately 292 cm total length (TL) based on clasper calcification,
   whereas females matured between 330 and 345 cm TL based on oviducal gland
   and uterus widths. Litter sizes ranged from 3 to 57 with a mean of 32.6
   embryos per litter. Data from 23 litters from various months of the year
   indicate that tiger sharks are usually 80–90 cm TL at birth, and that the
   gestation period is 15–16 months. Mating scars were observed in
   January–February and sperm is presumably stored for 4–5 months until
   ovulation takes place in May–July. Gestation begins in June–July and pups
   are born in September–October of the following year. Our data suggest
   that female tiger sharks in Hawaii give birth only once every three
   years. This could have major implications for conservation and management
   of this species, as it suggests that tiger shark fecundity is 33% lower
   than previously thought. This could greatly reduce the ability of this
   species to rebound from fishing pressure.

   imprecision for relatively large sample sizes and for the ages that
   constitute the bulk of the ages in the sample. However, the performance

AB An unprecedented series of shark attacks on humans off Recife,
   Pernambuco, Brazil within a 14-yr period from September 1992 to September
   2006 resulted in 47 incidents, including 17 fatalities. A suite of biotic
   and abiotic factors was examined to determine commonality in the attacks.
   Surfers and body boarders were the group most affected with a majority of
   victims being young (< 20 yrs old) males. Attacks occurred predominantly
   in shallow water, close to shore at beaches lying on a narrow channel
   bordered by an adjacent reef. Attacks transpired year-round with peaks in
   July and were distributed daily from Thursday to Tuesday, with peak on
   Sundays and no attacks recorded on Wednesdays. The construction and
   growth of the Suape Port, located just to the south of Recife, has
   resulted in major environmental degradation and is likely to have played
   a role in the recent onset of shark attacks. Individuals of the species
   most often implicated in the attacks, the bull shark, Carcharhinus leucas
   (Muller and Henle, 1839), may have been displaced from preferred
   estuarine/inshore habitats to the nearby Jaboatao River and the adjacent
   lagoon resulting in increased interaction with humans.

AB The horn sharks (Heterodontidae: Chon- drichthyes) represent one of four
   independent evolutions of durophagy in the cartilaginous fishes. We used
   high- resolution computed tomography (CT scanning) to visual- ize and
   quantify the mineralized tissue of an ontogenetic series of horn sharks.
   CT scanning of neonatal through adult California horn sharks
   (Heterodontus francisci) con- firmed that this technique is effective for
   examining min- eralized tissue in even small (10 mm) specimens. The jaw
   joint is among the first areas to become mineralized and is the most
   heavily mineralized area in the cranium of a neonatal horn shark. The
   hyoid is also well mineralized, although the poorly mineralized
   molariform teeth indicate that the neonatal animal may be a suction
   feeder on softer prey. The symphysis of the jaws never mineralizes, in
   sharp contrast to the condition in the hard prey-crushing stingrays.
   Digitally reslicing the CT scans along the jaws allowed measurement of
   the second moment of area (Ina). Assuming that the jaws are made of the
   same material at all ages, Ina is an indicator of the flexural stiffness
   of the jaws. In all sizes of shark the lower jaws were stiffer than the
   upper and the stiffness increased in the area of the molariform teeth.
   The central region of the jaws, where the rami meet, support cuspidate
   grasping teeth and has the lowest Ina. The spotted eagle ray (Aetobatus
   narinari), a hard prey-crushing stingray, shows a different pattern of
   flexural stiffness, with the peak at the central part of the jaws where
   the prey is reduced between flattened tooth plates. Although the eagle
   ray jaws have a higher Ina than the horn shark, they are also far more
   heavily min- eralized. When the relative amounts of mineralization are
   taken into account, horn sharks do better with what min- eral they have
   than does the eagle ray. With a tight jaw joint and loose mandibular
   symphysis, as well as nearly opposite patterns of stiffness in the jaws,
   it is clear that two of the clades of hard prey specialists use very
   different methods for cracking the hard prey problem. J. Morphol.

AB Greenland shark Somniosus microcephalus is a potentially important yet
   poorly studied coldwater species inhabiting the North Atlantic and Arctic
   Oceans. Broad-scale changes in the Arctic ecosystem as a consequence of
   climate change have led to increased attention on trophic dynamics and
   the role of potential apex predators such as S. microcephalus in the
   structure of Arctic marine food webs. Although Nordic and Inuit
   populations have caught S. microcephalus for centuries, the species is of
   limited commercial interest among modern industrial fisheries. Here, the
   limited historical information available on S. microcephalus occurrence
   and ecology is reviewed and new catch, biological and life-history
   information from the Arctic and North Atlantic Ocean region is provided.
   Given the considerable by-catch rates in high North Atlantic Ocean
   latitudes it is suggested that S. microcephalus is an abundant predator
   that plays an important, yet unrecognized, role in Arctic marine
   ecosystems. Slow growth and large pup sizes, however, may make S.
   microcephalus vulnerable to increased fishing pressure in a warming
   Arctic environment.

AB Aerial surveys have been used to estimate population abundance of both
   terrestrial and marine species; in the marine environment this has
   largely been used for air-breathing species that spend time regularly at
   the surface. Whale sharks spend a large proportion of their time close to
   the surface and so are amenable to aerial survey techniques. This study
   presents the results of six years of synoptic aerial belt-surveys done
   nearly daily during the peak whale shark season around the island of
   Mahe, Seychelles. A total of 580 survey flights were flown providing
   699.7 hours of survey record. A seasonal peak of shark sightings per hour
   was recorded in September or October in most years with the maximum on a
   single survey of 28.4 h- 1 in October 2006. The aerial survey data were
   used to generate an estimate of relative population abundance indicating
   that highest mean annual relative population estimate was also in 2006,
   with an estimate of 38, while the lowest mean estimate was 11 in 2004.
   These estimates were then compared to weekly capture-mark-recapture
   estimates of abundance based on unique individual identification data.
   The results indicate that the use of aerial survey data alone may give an
   acceptable indication of instantaneous relative population abundance but
   further refinement is necessary to estimate absolute regional abundance.

AB Abstract A generalized additive model (GAM) of blue shark, Prionace
   glauca, catch rates (catch per set) was fitted to data gathered by
   National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) observers stationed aboard
   Hawaii-based commercial longline vessels (N=2010 longline sets) from
   March 1994 to December 1997. Its coefficients were then applied to the
   values of predictor variables, which were also contained in logbook
   records that described the remainder of fishery-wide effort during the
   study period ( N=41 319 longline sets). The objective was to determine
   whether predictions generated by such a GAM could serve in lieu of
   observers on the large fraction of longline trips that do not carry an
   observer (approximately 95%). After deleting data considered false or
   inaccurate, much of which was associated with a small number of vessels,
   the relationship between catch rates as reported in logbooks and GAM
   predictions was expressed by log e (Y+1)=0.7952 log e (X+1)−0.0586 where
   Y is the catch rate (i.e., the number of blue shark caught per set) and X
   the GAM predictions (R 2 =0.307, N=40 243) . Patterns of correspondence
   between logbook trends and GAM predictions were further refined by
   plotting the trends according to the type of fishing effort (e.g., tuna-
   or swordfish-directed). The highest mean catch rates reported in
   logbooks, the highest mean GAM predictions, and the greatest differences
   between the two occurred consistently in mid-year on swordfish trips. In
   contrast, mean values from logbooks and mean GAM predictions were closest
   for tuna-directed effort, but this reflected an order of magnitude
   reduction in the scale of catch rates rather than closely similar trends.
   A bootstrapping algorithm developed for the GAM yielded an estimate of
   23.9% under-reporting for the study period, with approximate 95%
   prediction limits of 15.4–28.9%. We conclude that prediction with a GAM
   fitted to fishery observer data is a useful monitoring technique for the
   Hawaii-based commercial longline fishery. It allowed us: to gain insight
   into fleet-wide and individual logbook reporting practices, to estimate
   the relationship between logbook data and predicted values, to
   characterize bias in this relationship, and to identify patterns specific
   to each major sector of the fishery.

AB Grey reef sharks (Carcharhinus amblyrhynchos) are apex predators found on
   many Indo-Pacific coral reefs, but little is known about their movement
   patterns and habitat requirements. We used acoustic telemetry to
   determine movements and habitat use of these sharks at the isolated
   Rowley Shoals atolls, 250 km off the coast of north-western Australia. We
   equipped 12 male and 14 female sharks ranging from 0.79 to 1.69 m in
   total length with transmitters that were detected by an array of 11
   strategically placed receivers on two atoll reefs. Over 26,000 detections
   were recorded over the 325 days of receiver deployment. No sharks were
   observed to move between reefs. Receivers on the outer slopes of reefs
   provided nearly all (99%) of the detections. We found no differences in
   general attendance parameters due to size, sex or reef, except for
   maximum period of detection where larger sharks were detected over a
   longer period than smaller sharks. Male and female sharks were often
   detected at separate receivers at the outer slope habitat of one reef,
   suggesting sexual segregation, but this pattern did not occur at the
   second reef where males and females were detected at similar frequencies.
   We identified two patterns of daily behaviour: (1) sharks were present at
   the reef both day and night or (2) sharks spent more time in attendance
   during day than at night. Fast Fourier transforms identified 24-h cycles
   of attendance at the reef and a secondary peak of attendance at 12 h for
   most sharks, although no individuals shared the same attendance patterns.
   Our study provides baseline data that can be used to optimise the minimum
   area and habitat requirements for conservation of these apex predators.

AB The anatomy of the feeding apparatus of the lemon shark, Negaprion
   brevirostris, is investigated by gross dissection, computer axial
   tomography, and histological staining. The muscles and ligaments of the
   head associated with feeding are described. The upper and lower jaws are
   suspended by the hyoid arch, which in turn is braced against the
   chondrocranium by a complex series of ligaments. In addition, various
   muscles and the integument contribute to the suspension and stability of
   the jaws. The dual jaw joint is comprised of lateral and medial
   quadratomandibular joints that resist lateral movement of the upper and
   lower jaws on one another. This is important during feeding involving
   vigorous head shaking. An elastic ethmoplatine ligament that unites the
   anterior portion of the upper jaw to the neurocranium is involved with
   upper jaw retraction. The quadratomandibularis muscle is divided into
   four divisions with a bipinnate fiber arrangement of the two large
   superficial divisions. This arrangement would permit a relatively greater
   force per unit volume and reduce muscle bulging of the jaw adductor
   muscle in the spatially confined cheek region. Regions of relatively
   diffuse integumental ligaments overlying the adductor mandibulae complex
   and the levator palatoquadrati muscle, interspersed with localized
   regions of longer tendonlike attachments between the skin and the
   underlying muscle, permit greater musculoskeletal movement relative to
   the skin. The nomenclature of the hypobranchial muscles is discussed. In
   this shark they are comprised of the unsegmented coracomandibularis and
   coracohyoideus, and the segmented coracoarcualis. © 1995 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB Since the early 1950s a sport fishery for sharks has existed off
   south-west England. On average some 5000 sharks are taken annually on rod
   and line between May and October. The catch consists almost entirely of
   blue sharks, the majority of which are immature or adolescent females,
   limited numbers of the porbeagle, Lamna nasus Bonnaterre, mako, Isurus
   oxyrinchus Rafinesque and very occasionally the thresher, Alopias
   vulpinus Bonnaterre.

AB Background Work-related asthma (WRA) is the most common work-associated
   respiratory disease in developed countries. Method We report shark
   cartilage dust as a new potential cause of occupational asthma (OA) in
   the context of other fatal OA case reports. Results A 38-year-old white
   male worked for 8 years in a facility which primarily granulated and
   powdered various plastics. Sixteen months prior to his death, the plant
   began grinding shark cartilage. After 10 months of exposure, he reported
   chest symptoms at work in association with exposure to shark cartilage
   dust and a physician diagnosed asthma. Six months later, he complained of
   shortness of breath at work and died from autopsy-confirmed asthma. The
   latency from onset of exposure to symptoms and from symptom onset to
   death was shorter than 10 previously reported OA fatalities. Conclusion
   Recognition of occupational causes and triggers of asthma and removal of
   affected individuals from these exposures is critical and can prevent
   progression to irreversible or even fatal asthma. Am. J. Ind. Med. 42:

AB From July 1982 to December 1986, a study of the age and growth of the
   bonnethead shark Sphyrna tiburo was conducted in Tampa and Florida Bays,
   Florida, USA. Tetracycline-injected sharks held in captivity and, to a
   lesser extent, tagged, released and recaptured, were utilized for
   validating the annual nature of the rings (herein defined as the narrow,
   translucent regions) appearing on vertebral centra. The technique was
   validated for all age groups (0 to 6+yr) included in the study. Marginal
   increment analysis likewise suggested annual ring formation. The rings
   formed during the winter, when water temperatures were lowest. Using the
   vertebral ring aging-technique, von Bertalanffy growth curves for males
   and females from both tampa and Florida Bays were constructed. Growth of
   sharks born and held in captivity demonstrated that the male and female
   growth curves diverge after ∼1 yr and that mean sizes at age are
   statistically distinct after ∼2 yr. In both populations, females grew to
   larger sizes tha males and apparently are longer-lived. Reproductively
   mature females from Tampa Bay were significantly larger than those from

   between 0–40 mol% to study the effects on reconstituted Na + ,K +
   -ATPase. The maximum hydrolytic activity of reconstituted Na + ,K +
   -ATPase was increased by cholesterol at concentrations above 10 mol% for
   both the physiological Na + /K + -exchange reactions, as well as for the
   partial reactions Na + /Na + -exchange and uncoupled Na + efflux.
   Omission of cholesterol from the liposome bilayer modified the activation
   by cytoplasmic Na + , indicating effects on both V max and on the Na +
   -affinity. Several other kinetic parameters were found to be strongly
   influenced as well, most notable the steady-state phosphorylation level,
   and the characteristics of the phosphorylation/dephosphorylation
   reactions. These results indicate that cholesterol interacts directly
   with the Na + ,K + -ATPase as an essential effector perhaps by affecting
   its conformational mobility or monomer interaction.

AB We examined the effect of hypoxia on the swimming speed, respiration rate
   (oxygen uptake), gape and ventilation volume of the bonnethead shark,
   Sphyrna tiburo. We used a sonic flowmeter developed for this study to
   examine swimming speed changes of sharks held in artificial lagoons
   during diurnal dissolved oxygen changes. Sharks were observed to swim at
   about 34 cm s-1 during the day but increased to about 40 cm s-1 at night
   when dissolved oxygen levels fell to < 3 mg l-1. Using a closed system
   respirometer we examined changes in swimming speed, respiration rate and
   gape at four dissolved oxygen levels. Swimming speeds averaged 24 to 25
   cm s-1 under normoxic conditions but increased to 38 to 40 cm s-1 during
   hypoxia. Similarly, respiration rate increased with increasing speed and
   decreasing dissolved oxygen. Gape averaged about 1.0 cm under normoxic
   conditions and increased to a maximum of about 3.5 cm during hypoxia.
   Using assumed oxygen extraction efficiencies of 25, 50 and 75% and
   observed respiration rates, we estimated that ventilation volumes of
   about 25 to 470 l h-1, depending upon oxygen concentration, would be
   necessary for gill ventilation. These experiments suggest that changes in
   swimming speed and mouth gape are important for respiratory regulation in
   ram ventilating sharks.

AB The left ovary of the bonnethead shark, Sphyrna tiburo, is rudimentary,
   and the right ovary supplies both oviducts which share a common ostium
   situated in the falciform ligament. Preceding ovulation the nidamental
   gland of each oviduct hypertrophies and the caudal two-thirds of each
   oviduct is modified to form a uterus. In the Florida-Caribbean area
   Sphyrna tiburo probably mates in March and 3–7 eggs are fertilized in the
   vicinity of the nidamental gland of each oviduct. The developing embryo
   is nourished during the first 3–4 months of gestation by yolk stored in
   its extensive yolk sac. Approximately three and one-half months after
   fertilization, the distal portion of the yolk sac becomes convoluted and
   interdigitates with deep folds in the uterine wall to form a yolk-sac
   placenta. As the placenta develops, the maternal uterine epithelium is
   reduced from columnar cells to squamous cells, and the foetal yolk-sac
   epithelium is reduced from columnar and cuboidal cells to squamous cells.
   Exchange between the maternal and foetal blood systems takes place
   through maternal endothelium, reduced maternal epithelium, egg-case
   membrane, reduced foetal epithelium, and foetal endothelium.

AB Marine predators such as sharks often form single-sex aggregations as
   part of their diel behavioral cycle. Such aggregations are potentially
   driven by contrasting reproductive and behavioral strategies between the
   sexes, leading to distinct sexual segregation. There is, however, no
   experimental evidence that such predator aggregations are governed by
   intrinsic social systems, demonstrating long-term temporal stability.
   Social network structure, temporal stability, and activity profiles were
   analyzed to examine the impact of introduced males on social structure of
   4 captive groups of female catshark (Scyliorhinus canicula). Aside from
   foraging and habitat selection pressures, we question whether individual
   female sharks manage additional social demands that potentially influence
   activity budget and susceptibility to male harassment. Shark groups
   demonstrated marked differences in their tendency to aggregate in a
   unisex environment and concomitantly showed significant differences in
   social response to male presence. Dichotomy in social structure of the 4
   groups revealed that well-connected individuals demonstrated greater
   resilience to male disturbance. Socially isolated females experienced
   greater levels of partner exchange, reduced temporal stability, and
   increased activity levels in the presence of males and control females.
   These results are the first to demonstrate the disruptive influence that
   male and novel females have on weak female shark social interactions;
   conversely, aggregations demonstrating relatively strong temporally
   stable social bonds (at least by some individuals) are particularly
   resilient to potential male harassment and novel (female) intruders. We
   highlight that additional ‘social constraints’ may have disparate
   influence on individuals occupying different structural positions within
   a network and may thus impact individual fitness unequally. Key words:
   aggregation, behavior, fish, network analysis, sexual segregation, shark,
   social structure. [Behav Ecol]

AB Abstract Longline fishing is the most common elasmobranch capture method
   around the world, yet the physiological consequences of this technique
   are poorly understood. To quantify the sub-lethal effects of longline
   capture in the commonly exploited Caribbean reef shark ( Carcharhinus
   perezi ), 37 individuals were captured using standard, mid-water
   longlines. Hook timers provided hooking duration to the nearest minute.
   Once sharks were landed, blood samples were taken and used to measure a
   suite of physiological parameters. Control data were obtained by sampling
   an additional three unrestrained Caribbean reef sharks underwater at an
   established shark feeding site. The greatest level of physiological
   disruption occurred after 120–180 min of hooking, whereas sharks exposed
   to minimal and maximal hook durations exhibited the least disturbed blood
   chemistry. Significant relationships were established between hooking
   duration and blood pH, pCO 2 , lactate, glucose, plasma calcium and
   plasma potassium. Longline capture appears more benign than other methods
   assessed to date, causing a shift in the stress response from acute at
   the onset of capture to a sub-acute regime as the capture event
   progresses, apparently facilitating a degree of physiological recovery.
   Continued investigation into the physiological response of elasmobranchs
   to longline capture is vital for the effective management of such
   fisheries.

   cells expressing the right chemokine receptors to sites of immune
   response. They have been identified and studied extensively in mammals,
   but little is known about their presence in other vertebrate groups. Here
   we describe seven new chemokines in bony fish and one in a cartilaginous
   fish, as well as one chemokine receptor in a jawless vertebrate. All
   eight chemokines belong to the SCYA (CC) subfamily characterized by four
   conserved cysteine residues of which the first two are adjacent. The
   chemokine receptor is of the CXCR4 type. Phylogenetic analysis does not
   reveal any clear evidence of orthology of fish and human chemokines.
   Although the divergence of the subfamilies began before the fish–tetrapod
   split, much of the divergence within the subfamilies took place
   separately in the two vertebrate groups. The existence of a chemokine
   receptor in the lamprey indicates that chemokines are apparently also
   present in the Agnatha.

   To date information about the basic ecology and movements of whale sharks
   is sparse, and only recently has the species received global conservation

   sightings in the Andaman Sea for 10 years along 300 km of coastline.
   Whale shark sightings, corrected for effort, dropped by 96% between 1998
   and 2001. Combining the seasons from 1992 to 1998, the number of whale
   shark sightings increased significantly from October to May. The sizes of
   sharks observed suggest that the majority were juveniles. We discuss the
   limitations of using ecotourist operators as non-specialist volunteers
   for data collection but conclude that their use can be beneficial for
   long-term, broad geographic studies such as this.

AB Abstract Although bite force is a frequently studied performance measure
   of feeding ecology, changes in bite force over ontogeny have rarely been
   investigated. Biting by the blacktip shark Carcharhinus limbatus was
   theoretically modeled over ontogeny to investigate the scaling of bite
   force, the morphological basis of the observed scaling relationship, the
   ecological consequences of ontogenetic changes in performance, and
   whether cranial morphometrics can be used as an accurate proxy for bite
   force. Theoretical bite force, which was positively allometric with
   respect to total length (TL), ranged from 32 N (61 cm TL) to 423 N (152
   cm TL) at the anterior tips of the jaws and from 107 (61 cm TL) to 1083 N
   (152 cm TL) at the posterior teeth. This observation is attributed to
   positive allometry in the mechanical advantage of the jaw-adducting
   mechanism and the cross-sectional area of all four jaw-adducting muscles.
   Theoretical bite force was accurately predicted by cranial morphometrics
   including prebranchial length and head width as well. Although positive
   allometry of bite force in C. limbatus would seem to indicate an
   ecological necessity for this phenomenon, dietary analyses do not
   necessarily indicate any ontogenetic shift in prey types requiring larger
   bite forces. The positively allometric increase in theoretical bite force
   may be associated with numerous other selective pressures including
   maintenance of an apical position within the ecosystem.

   the distribution, abundance, habits and reproduction of the population,
   to produce reliable estimates of population growth. Because such detailed
   ecological information is usually unavailable, complete demographic
   analyses have been completed for only four shark species: the spiny
   dogfish, Squalus acanthias; the soupfin shark, Galeorhinus australis; the
   lemon shark, Negaprion brevirostris; and most recently the sandbar shark,
   Carcharhinus plumbeus. In California, reliable estimates of age, growth,
   mortality, age at maturity, and fecundity are available only for the
   leopard shark, Triakis semifasciata. A demographic analysis of this
   species yielded a net reproductive rate (Ro) of 4.467, a generation time
   (G) of 22.35 years, and an estimate of the instantaneous population
   growth coefficient (r) of 0.067. If the mean fishing pressure over 10
   years (F= 0.084) is included in the survivorship function, Ro and r are
   reduced considerably, especially if leopard sharks first enter the
   fishery at early ages. A size limit of 120 cm TL (estimated age 13
   years), especially for female sharks, is tentatively proposed for the
   leopard shark fishery.

AB : In previous studies on reptiles and elasmobranchs, we determined that
   some reticular groups are either absent or may be displaced compared to
   their locations in mammals. For example, nucleus raphe dorsalis, the
   largest serotoninergic cell group in mammals, is not present in rays,
   skates, or guitarfish. In the present study, we chose heterodontid
   sharks, a sister group to these batoids, for an out-group comparison of
   this and other characters. We identified cells in the brainstem of
   Heterodontus francisci by use of antibodies against tyrosine hydroxylase,
   serotonin, or leu-enkephalin and compared the distribution of these
   nuclei to descriptions in mammals and other elasmobranchs. The majority
   of tyrosine hydroxylase-positive cells were found in the midbrain
   tegmentum (A8-A10) and the hypothalamus. In addition, putative A1, A2,
   A5, A7 (noradrenergic) groups were found in the metencephalon and
   myelencephalon. Serotonin-positive cells were found in raphe nuclei and
   scattered lateral to the raphe. We identified probable homologues to

   superior (B8) cell groups, which have been described in mammals. A
   cluster of cells dorsomedial to the medial longitudinal fasciculus was

   serotonin immunoreactive cells were similar to each other, but the
   tyrosine-hydroxylase immunoreactive cells rarely intermingle with the
   former two immunoreactive cell types. Other reticular groups that
   contained both serotonin- and leu-enkephalin-positive cells included
   reticularis (r.) ventralis, r. magnocellularis, r. paragigantocellularis
   lateralis, r. pontis caudalis, and r. pontis oralis medialis and
   lateralis. Thus, this shark contains many of the major brainstem raphe
   and catecholaminergic cell groups described for rats, but the relative
   distribution of the immunopositive cell groups differs in mammals and
   cartilaginous fish.

AB Abstract From March 1998 to September 2000, we collected Atlantic
   Sharpnose Sharks, Rhizoprionodon terraenovae, in the north central Gulf
   of Mexico between St. Louis Bay, Mississippi and Perdido Bay, Alabama.
   Collections were typically made in the Mississippi Sound over a 4-day
   period, one site per day, using a gill net fished from 1500 to 2200 h at
   each site. We collected sharks each month from March to October of each
   year of the study. We made a total of 100 collections at approximately 60
   different sites. Rhizoprionodon terraenovae were very common and were
   distributed over the entire study area. We collected 1,344 R. terraenovae
   of all size classes and both sexes; 276 in 1998, 300 in 1999 and 768 in
   2000. The unexpectedly low number of adult females in collections (718
   adult males: 9 adult females) suggests that females rarely enter shallow
   waters after maturation and both pupping and mating occur outside of the
   Mississippi Sound. Sharks begin to appear inshore in the spring when

AB The role of learning in behaviour is well known for many animal taxa,
   including teleost fishes, insects, birds and mammals. However, its
   importance to sharks in everyday behavioural processes has rarely been
   considered. Almost 50 years ago the first learning experiments on sharks
   were conducted; our first section discusses these studies and places them
   in a framework of associative and non-associative learning. These
   experiments showed that sharks were capable of different forms of
   learning, such as operant and classical conditioning and habituation.
   Sharks could learn associations as rapidly as other vertebrates and also
   remember training regimes for several months. However, much of this
   experimental evidence was based on small sample sizes and few shark
   orders, such as Carcharhiniformes and Orectobliformes, leaving large gaps
   in our knowledge of the general learning capabilities of other shark
   orders. We also examine recent research that has tested for, or inferred
   learning in behavioural processes. This section reveals that sharks, like
   teleost fishes use learning to improve prey search and capture to
   potentially navigate and orientate in their home range and recognize
   conspecifics, heterospecifics and mates. Learning is also discussed in
   relation to ecotourism and fisheries. Findings indicated that these
   activities may lead to conditioning of sharks and that considerable
   effort should go into investigating what impact this could have on the
   shark species involved. Finally, we discuss the importance of combining
   laboratory experiments with field studies, the use of new experimental
   techniques, the role of model species and research priorities for future
   work.

AB The effects of gear selectivity and sample size on growth model selection
   for shark length-at-age data was investigated using simulated data sets
   for dusky (Carcharhinus obscurus) and Atlantic sharpnose (Rhizoprionodon
   terraenovae) sharks. Simulated data sets were generated using four
   different individual growth functions (von Bertalanffy, Gompertz,
   logistic and Schnute) with five different sample sizes and seven
   different sampling gear selectivity functions. Five growth models were
   fit to each data set and the Akaike information criterion (AIC) and AIC
   weights used to evaluate which fit best to the data. The accuracy of each
   of the fitting models was also determined and compared with estimates
   derived from AIC multi-model inference (MMI). The results demonstrated
   that no one growth model outperformed all other models in all situations,
   with the two-parameter von Bertalanffy model being selected most often by
   AIC. There were clear differences between the fitting models that were
   ranked the highest based on AIC selection or AIC weights and those based
   on models accuracy of length and growth parameter estimates. In most
   situations, the two-parameter von Bertalanffy model provided the least
   accuracy in parameter recovery, while the Schnute model was the most
   accurate individual model in most situations. The AIC MMI approach
   improved estimation accuracy over most individual models, except at very
   low sample sizes. These simulation results suggest that sample sizes of
   200 are required to consistently achieve good accuracy for growth
   parameters, and that sampling gear selectivity has clear effects on which
   growth models fit best to the data. The use of the AIC MMI approach is
   recommended, as it provides the most robust estimates of growth
   parameters.

AB Successful capture of prey often depends, in part, on the magnitude,
   duration and speed of feeding behaviours. Animal size and experience are
   potentially important to these aspects of behaviour, but the effects of
   scale on the muscular dynamics of and capture by aquatic vertebrates
   remain relatively unknown. This study examines scale effects on prey
   capture kinematics in the nurse shark Ginglymostoma cirratum , an
   inertial suction feeder. Morphometric analyses were performed on the
   heads and feeding apparati of 12 specimens between 71 and 244 cm total
   length (TL). These data indicated isometric growth of the feeding
   apparatus. The kinematics of prey capture in another 12 specimens (33 to
   268 cm TL) were recorded with high speed video (200 fps). Across the size
   range, maximal angular excursions remained constant whereas the maxima of
   linear excursions increased isometrically. However, various phases of the
   prey capture sequence apparently did not increase in duration.
   Regressions of the components of prey capture timing generally had slopes
   between 0 and 0.5, supporting a model of muscular scaling initially
   proposed for largemouth bass. This model implies that increases in the
   duration of prey capture are the result of physiological constraints on
   muscular contraction. There is also a pattern of scaling across several
   taxa of aquatic vertebrates consistent with a second model of
   musculoskeletal scaling, although it does not necessarily apply within
   each taxon.

   437.2 mg O2 kg −1 h −1 for C. acronotus, and 161.4 mg O2 kg −1 h −1 for
   M. norrisi. For ram-ventilating sharks, mouth gape averaged ∼1.0 cm
   whereas M. norrisi gillbeats averaged 56.0 beats min −1 . Swimming
   speeds, mouth gape, and oxygen consumption rate of S. tiburo and C.
   acronotus increased to a maximum of 37–39 cm s −1 , 2.5–3.0 cm, and 496

AB There are few phrases in the Western world that evoke as much emotion or
   as powerful an image as the words “shark” and “attack.” However, not all
   “shark attacks” are created equal. Under current labels, listings of
   shark attack may even include instances where there is no physical
   contact between shark and human. The dominant perception of intent-laden
   shark “attacks” with fatal outcomes is outdated as a generic term and
   misleading to the public. We propose new descriptive labels based on the
   different outcomes associated with human–shark interactions, including
   sightings, encounters, bites, and the rare cases of fatal bites. We argue
   two central points: first, that a review of the scientific literature
   shows that humans are “not on the menu” as typical shark prey. Second, we
   argue that the adoption of a more prescriptive code of reporting by
   scientists, the media, and policy makers will serve the public interest
   by clarifying the true risk posed by sharks and informing better policy
   making. Finally, we apply these new categories to the 2009 New South
   Wales Shark Meshing Report in Australia and the history of shark
   incidents in Florida to illustrate how these changes in terminology can
   alter the narratives of human–shark interactions.

   shark (Orectolobus maculates) as a homodimer of two protein chains, each
   composed of a single variable domain (V) domain and five constant
   domains. The IgNAR variable domain contains an intact antigen-binding
   site and functions as an independent domain able to react to antigen with
   both high specificity and affinity. Here we describe the successful
   construction of a synthetic phage-displayed library based upon a single
   anti-lysozyme clone HEL-5A7 scaffold, which was previously selected from
   an immune IgNAR variable domain library. The complementarity-determining
   region 3 (CDR3) loop of this clone was varied in both length and
   composition and the derived library was used to pan against two model
   proteins, lysozyme and leptin. A single anti-lysozyme clone (Ly-X20) and
   anti-leptin clone (Lep-12E1) were selected for further study. Both clones
   were shown to be functionally expressed in Escherichia coli, extremely
   thermostable and bind to corresponding antigens specifically. The results
   here demonstrate that a synthetic IgNAR variable domain library based on
   a single framework scaffold can be used as a route to generate antigen
   binders quickly, easily and without the need of immunization.

AB The finetooth shark inhabits shallow coastal waters of the western
   Atlantic from North Carolina to Brazil. It is common off the southeastern
   United States, where it spends the summer off Georgia and the Carolinas
   and winters off Florida. The species appears in the nursery and mating
   areas of South Carolina when the surface water temperature rises above
   20° C in late April and early May. Both adults and juveniles are common
   in the shallow coastal waters of South Carolina through the summer, where
   they feed primarily on menhaden. The finetooth shark leaves the Carolinas
   in early fall and migrates southward as the surface water temperature
   decreases below 20° C. Females reach maturity at about 1350 mm TL. Males
   mature at about 1300 mm TL. The finetooth shark has consecutive,
   year-long ovarian and gestation cycles, like most carcharhinid sharks.
   Mating occurs from early May to early June. Freshly mated females bear a
   large spermozeugma at the base of each uterus. The spermozeugmata are
   large almond shaped masses of individual spermatozoa embedded in a
   supporting matrix. Embryos are lecithotrophic during their first fifteen
   weeks of development. Subsequently, the embryos establish a placental
   connection to the mother. Implantation occurs when the embryos measure
   about 130 mm or at about the fifteenth week of gestation. Gravid females
   carrying young 480–550 mm TL enter the shallow water nurseries off South
   Carolina in late May. Parturition occurs from late May to mid-June, after
   a gestation period of about twelve months, plus or minus two weeks. The
   young measure 480–580 mm TL at birth. Oocytes grow little during the
   gestation cycle. After parturition, a cohort of oocytes begins to
   develop, that will be ovulated the following May. Thus, the ovarian cycle
   lasts about a year, although most of the oocyte growth occurs in the
   months just prior to ovulation.

   in Argentinean waters (October to April) from 1998 to 2001. Of the 408
   individuals examined, 168 (41.2%) had food remains in their stomachs. The
   proportion of individuals with food remains was negatively correlated
   with total length. In general, the diet was composed mainly of teleosts
   (98.5% IRI (index of relative impor- tance)), with invertebrates and
   chondrichthyans as minor prey. The diet varied ontogenetically and
   seasonally. Juveniles and adults differed in their consumption of
   invertebrates, with juveniles prey- ing more on benthic invertebrates,
   mainly the octopus Octopus tehuelchus, and adults on squid. From December
   to February, adults preyed mainly on benthic teleosts (almost exclusively
   the Atlantic midshipman Porichthys porosissimus), while from March to
   April the consumption of squid increased. A comparison of numbers of prey
   in stomachs with abundance of prey in the environment in March and April
   showed that, in these months, juveniles selected invertebrates and
   demersal teleosts and avoided pelagic teleosts and chondricthyan prey,
   and adults selected squid and avoided pelagic teleosts. This indicates
   that, during this period, G. galeus is not an opportunistic predator. The
   mean size of prey increased with increasing shark length, but even large
   sharks consumed small prey. All shark sizes consumed prey fragments that
   were significantly larger than other prey con- sumed whole. This
   indicates that G. galeus is able to overcome gape limitation by
   mutilating prey, and that the ontogenetic diet shift was not due to a
   change in the ability to seize prey.

   chromatography and HPLC on an amine-bound silica column. Structural

   and glucuronic acid, respectively) bear three or four sulfate groups in

AB Cellular and molecular biology of chloride secretion in the shark rectal
   gland: Regulation by adenosine receptors. The rectal gland of the dogfish
   shark ( Squalus acanthias ) is a sodium chloride secreting epithelial
   organ whose function was discovered in 1959 by Wendell Burger. The gland,
   composed of homogenous tubules of a single cell type, is an important
   model for secondary active chloride transport. Hormonal stimulation of
   chloride secretion in this system activates asymetrically arranged
   transport proteins (apical cAMP-activated CFTR-like Cl − channels,
   basolateral Na/K/2Cl cotransporters, Na/K-ATPase activity, and K +
   channels). Five receptors, hormones, and membrane proteins of the shark
   rectal gland involved in chloride secretion have been cloned recently.
   Because the intact gland can be perfused via a single artery and vein, it
   has been possible to examine precisely the metabolic regulation of
   chloride transport by endogenous adenosine. Rectal gland cells have a
   high density of both stimulatory A 2 type and inhibitory A 1 type
   adenosine receptors. When stimulated by secretagogues, chloride secretion
   and venous adenosine concentrations increase in parallel, with chloride
   secretion increasing from ∼150 to 2100 µEq/hr/g, and adenosine
   concentrations increasing from ∼5 to ∼890nM. This work of ion transport
   is accompanied by a marked fall in intracellular ATP activity and a rise
   in both intracellular AMP and adenosine activity. Agents that prevent the
   interaction of endogenous adenosine with extracellular receptors
   significantly increase the chloride transport response to secretagogues.
   When chloride transport is inhibited by blocking the Na/K/2Cl
   cotransporter with bumetanide, both adenosine release and chloride
   secretion fall to basal values. We recently cloned a unique adenosine
   receptor subtype that is distinct from previously cloned mammalian
   adenosine receptors. Because of its highly specialized function, single
   cell type, and simple vascular system, the shark rectal gland is an ideal
   model system for examining the metabolic regulation of chloride secretion
   by adenosine receptors.

AB Abstract Large marine protected areas (MPAs) have recently been
   established throughout the world at an unprecedented pace, yet the value
   of these reserves for mobile species conservation remains unclear. Reef
   shark populations continue to decline even within some of the largest
   MPAs, fueling unresolved debates over the ability of protected areas to
   aid mobile species that transit beyond MPA boundaries. We assessed the
   capacity of a large MPA to conserve grey reef sharks - a Near Threatened
   species with a widespread distribution and poorly understood offshore
   movement patterns - using a combination of conventional tags, satellite
   tags, and an emerging vessel tracking technology. We found that the
   54,000 km2 U.S. Palmyra Atoll National Wildlife Refuge in the central
   Pacific Ocean provides substantial protection for grey reef sharks, as
   two-thirds of satellite-tracked sharks remained within MPA boundaries for
   the entire study duration. Additionally, our analysis of > 0.5 million
   satellite detections of commercial fishing vessels identified virtually
   no fishing effort within the refuge and significant effort beyond the MPA
   perimeter, suggesting that large MPAs can effectively benefit reef sharks
   and other mobile species if properly enforced. However, our results also
   highlight limitations of place-based conservation as some of these
   reef-associated sharks moved surprising distances into pelagic waters (up
   to 926 km from Palmyra Atoll, 810 km beyond MPA boundaries). Small-scale
   fishermen operating beyond MPA boundaries (up to 366 km from Palmyra)
   captured 2% of sharks that were initially tagged at Palmyra, indicating
   that large MPAs provide substantial, though incomplete, protection for
   reef sharks.

AB A recent field-intensive program in Shark Bay, Western Australia provides
   new multi-scale perspectives on the world’s most extensive modern
   stromatolite system. Mapping revealed a unique geographic distribution of
   morphologically distinct stromatolite structures, many of them previously
   undocumented. These distinctive structures combined with characteristic
   shelf physiography define eight ‘Stromatolite Provinces’. Morphological
   and molecular studies of microbial mat composition resulted in a revised
   growth model where coccoid cyanobacteria predominate in mat communities
   forming lithified discrete stromatolite buildups. This contradicts
   traditional views that stromatolites with the best lamination in Hamelin
   Pool are formed by filamentous cyanobacterial mats. Finally, analysis of
   internal fabrics of stromatolites revealed pervasive precipitation of
   microcrystalline carbonate (i.e. micrite) in microbial mats forming
   framework and cement that may be analogous to the micritic
   microstructures typical of Precambrian stromatolites. These discoveries
   represent fundamental advances in our knowledge of the Shark Bay
   microbial system, laying a foundation for detailed studies of
   stromatolite morphogenesis that will advance our understanding of benthic
   ecosystems on the early Earth.

AB Seagrass meadows in Florida Bay and Shark Bay contain substantial stores
   of both organic carbon and nutrients. Soils from both systems are
   predominantly calcium carbonate, with an average of 82.1% CaCO3 in
   Florida Bay compared with 71.3% in Shark Bay. Soils from Shark Bay had,
   on average, 21% higher organic carbon content and 35% higher phosphorus
   content than Florida Bay. Further, soils from Shark Bay had lower mean
   dry bulk density (0.78 ± 0.01 g mL–1) than those from Florida Bay (0.84 ±
   0.02 mg mL–1). The most hypersaline regions of both bays had higher
   organic carbon content in surficial soils. Profiles of organic carbon and
   phosphorus from Florida Bay indicate that this system has experienced an
   increase in P delivery and primary productivity over the last century; in
   contrast, decreasing organic carbon and phosphorus with depth in the soil
   profiles in Shark Bay point to a decrease in phosphorus delivery and
   primary productivity over the last 1000 y. The total ecosystem stocks of
   stored organic C in Florida Bay averages 163.5 MgCorg ha–1, lower than
   the average of 243.0 MgCorg ha–1 for Shark Bay; but these values place
   Shark and Florida Bays among the global hotspots for organic C storage in
   coastal ecosystems.

   Measures to reduce catches of sharks associated with the winter influx of

   In addition, extensive removal of nets has resulted in a major reduction
   in effort. Collectively, these initiatives reduced mortalities of sharks
   by 64%. Baited lines, termed drumlines, were introduced at 18 beaches,
   where they replaced some of the nets. The former had a far lower by-catch
   of rays, turtles and cetaceans and significantly lower catches of certain
   shark species. Replacement of some nets with drumlines is planned for the
   remaining beaches.

AB Interspecies hybridisation in nature is a well-studied phenomenon, but it
   has not been analysed using genetic markers in the class Chondrichthyes
   (sharks, rays and chimeras). Two black-tip whaler shark species
   (Australian, Carcharhinus tilstoni; Common, C. limbatus) have overlapping
   distributions in Australia, distinct mitochondrial DNA sequence (ND4,
   COI, control region) and distinct morphological features such as length
   at sexual maturity, length at birth and number of vertebrae. A mismatch
   was observed between species identification using mtDNA sequence and
   species identification using morphological characters. To test whether
   hybridisation between the two species was responsible, a nuclear gene
   with species-specific mutations was sequenced. Extensive interspecies
   hybridisation was found to be occurring. Hybrids were found from five
   locations on the eastern Australian coastline, spanning 2,000 km. If
   hybrid fitness is low and hybrids are common, then fisheries recruitment
   may be overestimated and the productivity of the black-tip shark fishery
   may be well below that required to support commercial exploitation. To
   guard against identification errors, the likelihood of hybridisation and
   subsequent introgression should be assessed prior to using mtDNA (e.g.
   barcoding) to identify shark species. The C. limbatus–C. tilstoni species
   complex provides a unique opportunity to investigate the ability of
   sharks to adapt to environmental change, in particular, the impact of
   hybridization on species distributions which favour C. tilstoni along the
   north and C. limbatus along the south eastern Australian coastline.

TI THE REPRODUCTIVE BIOLOGY OF THE ATLANTIC SHARPNOSE SHARK, RHIZOPRIONODON
   TERRAENOVAE (RICHARDSON)
PY 1983
AB Atlantic sharpnose sharks, Rhizo]Jrionodon terraeno/Jae (Richardson),
   were collected in the north central Gulf of Mexico from June 1979 to May
   1980. The principal sampling devices employed were longline, trawl, and
   rod and reel. From a total of 215 Atlantic sharpnose sharks obtained
   during the study, 144 were female and 71 were male, ranging from 30 to
   107 cm total lengths. The reproductive anatomy of both male and female
   sharpnose sharks is described. Atlantic sharpnose sharks differ from
   other carcharhinids in that the ovary is developed on the left side in
   females and overlapping siphon sacs are present in males. Clasper
   development suggests that males mature at about 80 cm total length, while
   ovarian egg diameters show that female maturation occurs at about 85 cm.
   Matings occur primarily between mid-May and mid-July. Embryonic growth is
   rapid immediately after fertilization during summer and fall but declines
   during winter and spring. Gestation requires 10 to 11 months and
   parturitions probably ppak in June. Pups are released near shore atan
   average total length of 32 cm. Statistical analyses reveal a positive
   relationship between adult tolallenglh and litter size, with the largest
   individuals being the most fecund. An inverse relationship was observed
   between the numbers of embryos per uterus and embryo size. Mechanical
   "packing" within the uterus is proposed to explain the relationship. The
   seasonal distribution of sharpnose sharks was found to be determined by
   an inshore-offshore migration. The data indicate that during winter
   months in deeper offshore waters, aggregates of predominately adult
   female sharp nose sharks may be encountered. The sex ratio at birth was
   found to be 1: 1 but among adults collected a 1:2.8 ratio was observed.
   Studies dealing with the reproductive biology of elasmobranchs have
   fallen far behind the volu­ minous amount of data that have accumulated
   on reproduction in the teleostean fishes. The north­ ern Gulf of Mexico
   has been an area of particu­ lar neglect with only a few rather
   generalized studies (Springer 1938, 1940, 1950; Baughman and Springer
   1950). Springer's (1960) classic work on the natural history of the
   sandbar shark, Carcharhinus milberti (Eulamia milberti), con­ tains a
   great deal of reproductive information that might be applied to
   carcharhinid sharks in general. Likewise, Clark and von Schmidt's (1965)
   survey of the sharks of the central gulf Coast of Florida provided
   valuable reproductive data. The understanding of the life history of the
   blue shark, Prionace glauca, was furthered by Pratt's (1979) examination
   of its reproductive biology.

AB Abstract While the general structure of immunoglobulin chains has
   remained relatively unchanged throughout evolution, the organization of
   the genes encoding these molecules differs substantially. To understand
   how the rearranging immunoglobulin system arose, it is necessary to
   examine living representatives of the most early vertebrate phyla.
   Elasmo-branches, which include the sharks, skates, and rays, are the most
   primitive phylogenetic class of vertebrates from which immunoglobulin DNA
   sequences have been obtained. In the sandbar shark (Carcharhinus
   plumbeus), the genes are arranged in individual clusters in which a
   single variable (V), joining (J), and constant (C) region gene, along
   with upstream regulatory elements, span a distance of approximately 4.4
   kb or approximately 5.8 kb. We report the complete sequence of a genomic
   clone encoding sandbar shark lambda light chain. A unique finding of our
   study is that the V and J genes are fused in the germ line. Three
   additional clones have been shown by DNA sequencing to also have fused V
   and J genes. The four clones have complementarity-determining regions 3
   of various lengths and amino acid sequence variability similar to the
   products of rearranged genes. Furthermore, analysis by polymerase chain
   reaction technology revealed an additional 26 genomic clones
   demonstrating fusion of the V and J segments. Therefore, VJ fusion is the
   prominent organizational feature of sandbar shark immunoglobulin light
   chain genes. This finding raises questions concerning the necessity of
   recombination to produce an antibody repertoire capable of reacting
   against a diverse array of antigens.

   collagen solution was measured as a function of temperature. AASC showed
   a greater contribution of elastic behavior rather than viscous behavior.

AB Abstract Understanding the habitat preferences of large marine
   vertebrates has only recently become tractable with the widespread
   availability of satellite telemetry for monitoring movements and
   behaviour. For many species with low population abundances, however,
   little progress has been made in identifying space use patterns. The
   endothermic porbeagle shark, Lamna nasus , has declined in the North
   Atlantic due to severe fishing pressure, with little evidence of
   recovery. One potential factor exacerbating population decline is area
   fidelity to coastal waters where fisheries are intensive. We tested for
   short-term area fidelity by attaching pop-up satellite-linked archival
   transmitters to four porbeagles in summer 2007, resulting in 175 days
   total tracking time covering an estimated 10,256 km distance. Throughout
   July and August the sharks occupied localised areas (8,602 – 90,153 km 2
   ) within the Celtic Sea, between the south-west UK, south-west Wales and
   southern Ireland. Only one shark was tracked into the autumn, when it
   moved into deep water off the continental shelf, then north towards
   colder latitudes. Sharks occupied a broad vertical depth range (0 – 552
   m) and water temperatures (9° - 19 °C). Dives were made frequently from
   the surface to near the seabed in shelf areas, however, in shelf edge
   habitats extended periods of time were spent at depths > 300 m.
   Porbeagles showed considerable plasticity in diel depth changes within
   and between individuals and as a function of habitat type. In addition to
   no obvious day-night difference in depth occupation, some sharks showed
   reverse diel vertical migration (DVM) (dawn ascent – dusk descent) in
   well-mixed coastal waters whereas normal DVM (dawn descent – dusk ascent)
   characterised movements into deeper, thermally well-stratified waters.
   The variable behaviours may reflect the need for different search
   strategies depending on habitat and prey types encountered. These results
   show porbeagles are potentially vulnerable to fisheries throughout the
   summer when they aggregate, and that large scale movement across national
   boundaries identifies the need for international conservation measures.

   (Ictalurus punctatus). As in the higher vertebrates, the fish C4 proteins
   have three-chain structures while the C3 proteins have two-chain
   structures. All four proteins have intra-chain thioesters located within
   their highest molecular mass polypeptides. N-terminal sequence analysis
   of the polypeptides has confirmed the identity of the proteins. In all
   cases except the catfish C3 α-chain, which appears to have a blocked
   N-terminus, sequence similarities are apparent in comparisons with the
   chains of C3 and C4 from higher vertebrates. We have confirmed that the

AB The purpose of this study was to investigate the reproductive biology of
   sandbar sharks, Carcharhinus plumbeus from northeastern Taiwan waters. A
   total of 885 sandbar sharks was examined. The size of 50% maturity in
   sandbar shark is taken to be 170-175 cm and 175 cm for females and males,
   respectively. The number of embryos per litter ranged from four to 12,
   with a mean of 7.54. Pregnant individuals containing six, seven, or eight
   embryos constituted 59 (80%) of the 74 females examined. Of 558 embryos
   in 74 litters examined, 274 were female and 284 were male. The null
   hypothesis of a 1:1 sex ratio is not rejected at the 0.05 level. Pups are
   born from Feb. to April. We estimate the gestation period to be 10-12
   months. Most embryos had attained a total length of about 60-65 cm after
   10-12 months of development, at which size they could be readily
   separated from the placenta, suggesting that they were full term and
   ready to be born. The relationship between the total number of uterine
   embryos and the total length of mother is roughly described by the
   regression equation (n = -7.544 + 0.075 TL; n = 74; r = 0.41). Although
   it is clear from this regression that fecundity is related to the size of
   the mother, the relationship is not particularly strong. We find that
   fertilization occurs during April and May, two months prior to the
   estimate reported by Taniuchi for C. plumbeus in Japanese waters.

   caught in the gill nets which protect the tourist beaches of Natal. The
   catch rate showed no trend, fluctuating about a mean of 0,34
   sharks·km-net−1·year−1. Catches were highest between May and November,
   when the water tends to be cooler. The sex ratio was 1,4 males to 1
   female. Specimens ranged in size from 84 to 276 cm precaudal length, with
   a mode of 191–195 cm for males and 251–255 cm for females. Males matured
   at 160-170 cm and females at approximately 220 cm. Catches included two
   recently fertilized females and two with well-developed embryos. External
   injuries were found on 14 per cent of males examined and 41 per cent of
   females. Elasmobranchs were the most common prey category, occurring in
   60 per cent of stomachs containing food, followed by teleosts at 40 per
   cent. Most of the elasmobranch prey were sharks shorter than 1 m.

AB The adaptive immune system depends on specific antigen receptors,
   immunoglobulins (Ig) in B lymphocytes and T cell receptors (TCR) in T
   lymphocytes. Adaptive responses to immune challenge are based on the
   expression of a single species of antigen receptor per cell; and in B
   cells, this is mediated in part by allelic exclusion at the Ig heavy (H)
   chain locus. How allelic exclusion is regulated is unclear; we considered
   that sharks, the oldest vertebrates possessing the Ig/TCR-based immune
   system, would yield insights not previously approachable and reveal the
   primordial basis of the regulation of allelic exclusion. Sharks have an
   IgH locus organization consisting of 15–200 independently rearranging
   miniloci (VH-D1-D2-JH-Cμ), a gene organization that is considered
   ancestral to the tetrapod and bony fish IgH locus. We found that
   rearrangement takes place only within a minilocus, and the recombining
   gene segments are assembled simultaneously and randomly. Only one or few
   H chain genes were fully rearranged in each shark B cell, whereas the
   other loci retained their germline configuration. In contrast, most IgH
   were partially rearranged in every thymocyte (developing T cell)
   examined, but no IgH transcripts were detected. The distinction between B
   and T cells in their IgH configurations and transcription reveals a
   heretofore unsuspected chromatin state permissive for rearrangement in
   precursor lymphocytes, and suggests that controlled limitation of B cell
   lineage-specific factors mediate regulated rearrangement and allelic
   exclusion. This regulation may be shared by higher vertebrates in which
   additional mechanistic and regulatory elements have evolved with their
   structurally complex IgH locus.

   with 45 Hox genes that include orthologs for a higher number of ancient
   gnathostome Hox genes than the 4 clusters in tetrapods and the
   supernumerary clusters in teleost fishes. Phylogenetic analysis of
   elephant shark Hox genes from 7 paralogous groups that contain all of the
   4 members indicated an ((AB)(CD)) topology for the order of Hox cluster
   duplication, providing support for the 2R hypothesis (i.e., 2 rounds of
   whole-genome duplication during the early evolution of vertebrates).
   Comparisons of noncoding sequences of the elephant shark and human Hox
   clusters have identified a large number of conserved noncoding elements
   (CNEs), which represent putative cis-regulatory elements that may be
   involved in the regulation of Hox genes. Interestingly, in fugu more than
   50% of these ancient CNEs have diverged beyond recognition in the
   duplicated (HoxA, HoxB, and HoxD) as well as the singleton (HoxC) Hox
   clusters. Furthermore, the b-paralogs of the duplicated fugu Hox clusters
   are virtually devoid of unique ancient CNEs. In contrast to fugu Hox
   clusters, elephant shark and human Hox clusters have lost fewer ancient
   CNEs. If these ancient CNEs are indeed enhancers directing
   tissue-specific expression of Hox genes, divergence of their sequences in
   vertebrate lineages might have led to altered expression patterns and
   presumably the functions of their associated Hox genes.

AB Extant chondrichthyans possess a predominantly cartilaginous skeleton,
   even though primitive chondrichthyans produced bone. To gain insights
   into this peculiar skeletal evolution, and in particular to evaluate the
   extent to which chondrichthyan skeletogenesis retains features of an
   osteogenic programme, we performed a histological, histochemical and
   immunohistochemical analysis of the entire embryonic skeleton during
   development of the swell shark Cephaloscyllium ventriosum. Specifically,
   we compared staining properties among various mineralizing tissues,
   including neural arches of the vertebrae, dermal tissues supporting oral
   denticles and Meckel's cartilage of the lower jaw. Patterns of
   mineralization were predicted by spatially restricted alkaline
   phosphatase activity earlier in development. Regarding evidence for an
   osteogenic programme in extant sharks, a mineralized tissue in the
   perichondrium of C. ventriosum neural arches, and to a lesser extent a
   tissue supporting the oral denticle, displayed numerous properties of
   bone. Although we uncovered many differences between tissues in Meckel's
   cartilage and neural arches of C. ventriosum, both elements impart
   distinct tissue characteristics to the perichondral region. Considering
   the evolution of osteogenic processes, shark skeletogenesis may
   illuminate the transition from perichondrium to periosteum, which is a
   major bone-forming tissue during the process of endochondral
   ossification.

   mother and embryo delta(15)N (i.e. Deltadelta(15)N) being 1.4 per
   thousand for muscle, 1.7 per thousand for liver and 1.1 per thousand for
   cartilage. Embryo muscle and liver were enriched in (13)C (both
   Deltadelta(13)C means = 1.5 per thousand) and embryo cartilage was
   depleted (Deltadelta(13)C mean = -1.01 per thousand) relative to
   corresponding maternal tissues. While differences in delta(15)N and
   delta(13)C between mothers and their embryos were significant, muscle
   delta(15)N values indicated embryos to be within the range of values
   expected if they occupied a similar trophic position as their respective
   mothers. Positive linear relationships existed between embryo total
   length (L(T)) and Deltadelta(15)N for muscle and liver and embryo L(T)
   and Deltadelta(13)C for muscle, with those associations possibly
   resulting from physiological differences between smaller and larger

   shift (yolk feeding to placental feeding) that occurs during the

   ecosystems, and Shark Bay, Australia, holds one of the best examples of
   these systems. Identifying the spatial distribution of microorganisms
   with mat depth facilitates a greater understanding of specific niches and
   potentially novel microbial interactions. High throughput sequencing
   coupled with elemental analyses and biogeochemical measurements of two
   distinct mat types (smooth and pustular) at a millimeter scale were
   undertaken in the present study. A total of 8,263,982 16S rRNA gene
   sequences were obtained, which were affiliated to 58 bacterial and
   candidate phyla. The surface of both mats were dominated by
   Cyanobacteria, accompanied with known or putative members of
   Alphaproteobacteria and Bacteroidetes. The deeper anoxic layers of smooth
   mats were dominated by Chloroflexi, while Alphaproteobacteria dominated
   the lower layers of pustular mats. In situ microelectrode measurements
   revealed smooth mats have a steeper profile of O2 and H2S concentrations,
   as well as higher oxygen production, consumption, and sulfate reduction
   rates. Specific elements (Mo, Mg, Mn, Fe, V, P) could be correlated with
   specific mat types and putative phylogenetic groups. Models are proposed
   for these systems suggesting putative surface anoxic niches, differential
   nitrogen fixing niches, and those coupled with methane metabolism.

AB We illustrate the theoretical plausibility that fishery removal of sharks
   can indirectly alter predation pressure on different fish species via the
   behavioural responses of mesoconsumers released from predator
   intimidation. Our dynamic state variable model of foraging decisions by
   harbour seals, a mesopredator, predicted indirect effects of the removal
   of Pacific sleeper sharks on two species consumed by seals, Pacific
   herring and walleye pollock, as mediated by seal behaviour. Herring, a
   fatty fish, form near-surface aggregations that often are ephemeral and
   widely dispersed. Pollock are found in the deeper strata preferred by
   sharks and have lower energy density than herring, but also are larger
   and their more continuous distribution potentially makes them the more
   predictable resource for seals. During simulations, predation risk from
   sharks produced an asymmetric trophic cascade mediated by the seal's
   underutilisation of deeper, riskier strata. Risk management by seals
   reduced mortality on pollock, which required riskier access in deep
   strata, while increasing mortality on herring, which could be accessed
   with less risk in shallow strata. This effect, however, attenuated if
   herring were scarcer and seal energy state was poor. During shark removal
   scenarios, seals shifted to deeper strata, increasing pollock consumption
   and substantially decreasing use of herring; the proportional change was
   greatest if seals were in good energy state. Prior studies have addressed
   how shark declines might affect community structure through density
   responses by species consumed by sharks; earlier models incorporating
   antipredator behaviour of the mesopredator (i.e. Ecosim/Ecospace) allow
   for activity reduction but not for the spatial shifts that altered the
   asymmetric trophic cascade in our simulations. Our results suggest that
   shark declines might have stronger ecological consequences than
   previously recognised if we account for spatial and diet shifts by
   mesoconsumers released from shark intimidation.

   are present in the shark that exist in mammals and similar criteria may
   be used for their differentiation. Neurons have frequently round nuclei
   with a prominent nucleoli; cytoplasm is abundant and filled with formed
   elements; somatic synapses and subsurface cisterns are rare. Astrocytes
   are smaller, and have less cytoplasm and slightly fewer organelles. Glial
   fibrils occur, but are not invariably present. Separating astrocytes from
   neurons is the most difficult identification problem.
   Oligodendrogliocytes are smaller, and have denser cytoplasm and a dark
   nucleus. The striking feature of capillary morphology is the presence of
   an appreciable perivascular space containing collagen; many tortuous
   evanginations of this space occur into surrounding glial processes which
   completely invest the capillaries. Astrocyte cell bodies frequently lie
   immediately next to vessels, and capillaries are occasionally totally
   surrounded by a single astrocyte process, thus being endocellular.
   Smaller pericapillary processes may be either astrocytic or ependymal.
   Dendrites, synapses, axons, and myelin have no obvious special
   characteristics. Sodium, visualized by precipitation techniques, is
   prominent in the astroglia and neurons.

AB Centrophorus granulosus is a deep sea shark that reproduces through
   aplacental viviparity. Its fecundity is one of the lowest described with
   only one embryo in a pregnancy lasting about two years. Its mature
   ovarian egg reaches one of the largest cellular sizes (> 350 g) described
   for any animal species. A previous report suggested a loss of organic
   matter during development of about 50% (Ranzi 1932), the highest rate
   reported for any elasmobranch. We measured the amounts of water, organic
   and inorganic matter in a complete series of embryos, by drying and later
   incinerating separately the external yolksac, eviscerated body, internal
   yolksac, liver and digestive tract. Wet weight of uterine ova ranged from
   143.2–370.4 g, was positively and significantly correlated with maternal
   size, and the size of full-term embryos increased with maternal size. A
   graphical method was developed to allow weight comparison between uterine
   ova and full-term embryos while taking into account the initial
   variability in uterine ova size. Total wet weight of the embryo system
   increased during development by +31/+34%. Changes in percentage
   composition (from initial values) were: water +99/+101%; organic matter
   −18/−25%; inorganic matter +114/+170%. The rate of decrease of organic
   matter was much lower than previously suggested, and was similar to
   values described for oviparous species. These results suggest that C.
   granulosus is a strictly lecithotrophic species, with no maternal
   contribution of organic matter during development, although the female
   does provide both water and inorganic material. Other factors that might
   influence the accuracy of this assessment are discussed.

   109 individuals caught during 2000–2003 off the western coast of Baja
   California Sur, Mexico. A further 110 individuals were measured to obtain
   data on the age distribution of the population being fished. Sharks
   ranged from 77 to 290 cm in total length (TL). A significant linear
   relationship (r2 = 0.91) was found between the vertebrae radius and total
   length, suggesting isometric growth of vertebrae with total length.
   Distinct bands of heavier calcification were visualized with silver
   nitrate staining. The periodicity of these growth marks was determined by

   the year. We found that one growth mark is deposited annually. Estimated
   ages ranged from 0 to 18 years, with the majority of fish being 1–5 years
   old. Age and TL were used to describe the shortfin mako growth. Estimates
   of the von Bertalanffy curve parameters for the combined sexes were: L∞ =
   411 cm TL, k = 0.05 year−1, t0 = −4.7 years. Our results suggest that
   shortfin makos are relatively slow growing sharks, which combined with
   other life-history traits such as a low fecundity and delayed
   reproduction, makes this species highly susceptible to overfishing.

AB Shark Bay, Western Australia, is geographically remote from all known
   industrial and geological sources of heavy metals. Surprisingly, several
   species of mollusc found here have cadmium contents which exceed both the
   usual limits of 2 ppm wet weight for molluscs taken for human
   consumption, and levels found in molluscs from areas of recognised heavy
   metal pollution. We know of no other pollution-free locality where
   similarly high cadmium concentrations are found in molluscs. The cadmium
   content of several species of Shark Bay moll uses frequently exceeds 5
   ppm wet weight, locally exceeds 10 ppm, and shows substantial regional
   variation within the embayment. Some regionally variable factors which
   could influence the rate of cadmium uptake include, an anthropogenic
   source, species variation, and salinity variation, but these
   possibilities are precluded by the data. Other regionally variable
   factors include, dissolved cadmium concentrations, substrate sediment
   composition, and local groundwater influx, but present data do not reveal
   a satisfactory explanation for the regional variation observed. T he
   selective concentration of cadmium in the adductor muscle of the pearl
   oyster ( Pinctada Carchariarium ) and curiously high cadmium/zinc ratios
   are described. Various methods are evaluated for reducing the cadmium
   content of Shark Bay molluscs prior to human consumption. These include,
   selection by size and location, discarding the adductor muscle, and
   leaching in brine.

AB This paper presents a prototype system that enables an autonomous
   underwater vehicle (AUV) to autonomously track and follow a shark that
   has been tagged with an acoustic transmitter. The AUV's onboard processor
   handles both real-time estimation of the shark's two-dimensional planar
   position, velocity, and orientation states, as well as a straightforward
   control scheme to drive the AUV toward the shark. The AUV is equipped
   with a stereo- hydrophone and receiver system that detects acoustic
   signals transmitted by the acoustic tag. The particular hydrophone system
   used here provides a measurement of relative bearing angle to the tag,
   but it does not provide the sign (+ or −) of the bearing angle.
   Estimation is accomplished using a particle filter that fuses bearing
   measurements over time to produce a state estimate of the tag location.
   The particle filter combined with a heuristic-based controller allows the
   system to overcome the ambiguity in the sign of the bearing angle. The
   state estimator and control scheme were validated by tracking both a
   stationary tag and a moving tag with known positions. Offline analysis of
   these data showed that state estimation can be improved by optimizing
   diffusion parameters in the prediction step of the filter, and
   considering signal strength of the acoustic signals in the resampling
   stage of the filter. These experiments revealed that state estimate
   errors were on the order of those obtained by current long-distance
   shark-tracking methods, i.e., manually driven boat-based tracking
   systems. Final experiments took place in SeaPlane Lagoon, Los Angeles,
   where a 1-m leopard shark (Triakis semifasciata) was caught, tagged, and
   released before being autonomously tracked and followed by the proposed
   AUV system for several hours. C

AB Many fishery management agencies are adopting harvest control rules
   (HCRs) to achieve harvest policies and management objectives. HCRs,
   however, often require data-intensive stock assessments to facilitate the
   harvest prescription. An HCR based on catch and catch per unit effort
   (cpue) was developed for the southern and eastern scalefish and shark
   fishery of Australia, for stocks that lack the data needed to conduct a
   full statistical catch-at-age assessment. The HCR produces a recommended
   biological catch and is characterized by two parameters, target cpue and
   target catch, both derived from historical data. Simulation tests showed
   that the HCR could guide the stock to the desired state from different
   initial levels of depletion. However, the selection of parameter values
   for the HCR was critical. Achieving fishery objectives was difficult when
   the target catch was a function of recent catch, rather than data from a
   predefined historical reference period. Problems may also arise when
   specifying the reference period on which the HCR parameters are
   determined. The cpue-based HCR is a valuable tool for managing fisheries
   where monitoring and assessment activities are relatively expensive, or
   in general, where data are scarce.

   (Carcharhinus limbatus) was monitored via a series of acoustic
   hydrophones over a period of three years to examine their use of a
   coastal nursery area. Data from this project were used to investigate the
   efficacy of hypothetical marine protected areas for this population.
   Small and large reserve designs were used to determine which would
   provide better protection for this population. The small reserve provided
   consistent levels of protection across years with sharks receiving good
   protection early in the summer season, but with declining protection
   thereafter. The large reserve provided less consistent levels of
   protection across years, but provided protection for a greater portion of
   time than the small reserve. Excursions from the small reserve were high
   early in the season and declined as sharks used this region less through
   the later portion of the summer. Excursions from the large reserve did
   not show any consistent pattern, but were also high early in the season
   and decreased through time as sharks used less of the reserve area. These
   results, coupled with previously calculated mortality estimates, revealed
   that the large reserve provided better protection for young sharks during
   their most vulnerable period within the nursery. We suggest that
   time-area closures for nursery populations of highly mobile shark species
   may be of value. Results of this study also show that long-term data may
   be critical to effective reserve design and placement, and assessment of
   reserve efficacy.

   which people may face binding borrowing constraints. The model leads to
   much different conclusions and policy recommendations than static models.
   In particular, the government cannot generate full compliance by setting
   the expected value of cheating to be negative. Also, it is possible for
   the government to set penalties in a way that will increase tax revenue
   over that of full compliance. The government can increase welfare by
   playing the role of ‘loan shark’ to people whose borrowing is constrained
   on the private market.

TI RELATIONSHIPS OF THE BLUE SHARK, PRIONACE GLAUCA, AND ITS PREY SPECIES
   NEAR SANTA CATALINA ISLAND, CALIFORNIA 1
PY 1979
AB Small fishes and cephalopods associated with both pelagic and inshore
   habitats composed the major prey for the blue shark, Prionace glauca,
   near Santa Catalina Island, Calif. The northern anchovy, Engraulis
   mordax, was the predominant prey for sharks in the immediate study area
   while at least 13 species ofpelagic cephalopods constituted major prey
   for sharks in more distant oceanic waters. Inshore species taken by
   sharks included pipefish, Syngnathus californiensis; jack mackerel,
   Trachurus sym­ metricus; and blacksmith, Chromispunctipinnis. In
   addition, sharks moved inshore to feed on winter spawning schools
   ofmarket squid, Loligo opalescens. Digestive rate studies and telemetric
   monitoring of activity patterns indicate that sharks forage in waters
   near the surface from around midnight through dawn. Diel activities of
   prey species were examined and show that most prey dispersed in the upper
   water column at night and refuged during the day either by schooling
   (anchovies and jack mackerel) or by retreating to deeper waters (pelagic
   cephalopods). Field observations ofshark feeding behavior indicate that
   predatory modes vary in response to prey behavior. The blue
   shark,Prionaceglauca (Carcharhinidae) (Figure 1), is a pelagic carnivore
   cosmopolitan in tropical and warm temperate seas. Because of its pelagic
   habits, the majority of ecological studies on this species have been
   predicated on data from sharks captured by sport and commercial
   fisheries. As a result data has been largely qual­ itative, and the
   shark's role as a predator in the epipelagic habitat has remained
   unclear. The importance of small fish as prey items for blue sharks has
   been described by Couch (1862), Lo Bianco (1909), Bigelow and Schroeder
   (1948), Strasburg (1958), LeBrasseur (1964), Bane (1968), Stevens (1973),
   and others. These prey generally are schooling species common in
   productive coast­ al waters. Cephalopods were also reported as major prey
   but little information is available on specific identifications (see
   Stevens 1973; Clarke and Stevens 1974). Although blue sharks have been
   observed feed­ ing on dead or wounded cetaceans (Bigelow and Schroeder
   1948; Cousteau and Cousteau 1970) there is little indication that they
   habitually prey on live, healthy marine mammals. The occurrence

   male and female vertebral age data. Initial growth was rapid (≈ 200 mm
   TL) for both sexes from age 0–1. At age 2 growth slowed for males but
   continued for females. Similar to many species of sharks, females grew
   slower than males (K = 0.28 and K = 0.69, respectively) but attained a
   larger maximum size (L∞=1226 and L∞=897). Maximum age was estimated in
   males and females to be 8+ and 12+ years, respectively. Growth of
   young-of-year sharks was 21 to 30 mm TL per month determined by three
   different methods. A comparison of age and growth estimates from

   from the liver of the nurse shark (Ginglymostoma cirratum) was determined
   by high-performance tandem mass spectrometry (employing multichannel
   array detection) and Edman degradation. Shark liver FABP consists of 132
   amino acids with an acetylated N-terminal valine. The chemical molecular
   mass of the intact protein determined by electrospray ionization mass
   spectrometry (Mr= 15124 ± 2.5) was in good agreement with that calculated
   from the amino acid sequence (Mr= 15121.3). The amino acid sequence of
   shark liver FABP displays significantly greater similarity to the FABP
   expressed in mammalian heart, peripheral nerve myelin and adipose tissue
   (61 – 53% sequence similarity) than to the FABP expressed in mammalian
   liver (22% similarity). Phylogenetic trees derived from the comparison of
   the shark liver FABP amino acid sequence with the members of the
   mammalian fatty-acid/retinoid-binding protein gene family indicate the
   initial divergence of an ancestral gene into two major subfamilies: one
   comprising the genes for mammalian liver FABP and gastrotropin, the other
   comprising the genes for mammalian cellular retinol-binding proteins I
   and II, cellular retinoic-acid-binding protein myelin P2 protein,
   adipocyte FABP, heart FABP and shark liver FABP, the latter having
   diverged from the ancestral gene that ultimately gave rise to the present
   day mammalian heart-FABP, adipocyte FABP and myelin P2 protein sequences.
   The sequence for intestinal FABP from the rat could be assigned to either
   subfamily, depending on the approach used for phylogenetic tree
   construction, but clearly diverged at a relatively early evolutionary
   time point. Indeed, sequences proximately ancestral or closely related to
   mammalian intestinal FABP, liver FABP, gastrotropin and the
   retinoid-binding group of proteins appear to have arisen prior to the
   divergence of shark liver FABP and should therefore also be present in
   elasmobranchs. The presence in shark liver of an FABP which differs
   substantially in primary structure from mammalian liver FABP, while being
   closely related to the FABP expressed in mammalian heart muscle,
   peripheral nerve myelin and adipocytes, opens a further dimension
   regarding the question of the existence of structure-dependent and
   tissue-specific specialization of FABP function in lipid metabolism.

   the data for both food types. This model suggests that gastric emptying
   is characterized by an initial lag phase during which evacuation rate
   increases, a period of maximal evacuation, and a decreasing evacuation
   rate during the later stages of digestion. Passage of food from the
   stomach was slow relative to other species of fish studied. The time
   required to evacuate 98% of a meal was 92–3 and 70–7 h for sharks fed

AB Abstract A non-linear hydrodynamic model is used to describe the tidal
   dynamics of Shark Bay, Western Australia. The model is forced by tidal
   elevations generated by M 2 , S 2 , K 1 and O 1 constituent data at the
   open boundaries. The absence of suitable boundary data required a
   ‘calibration’ of the boundary condition against the known constituent
   data from within the model domain. The model provides a good match to the
   available field data, and allows the surface-level and current response
   to be resolved over the entire domain. Due to a near quarter-wave
   resonance of the semi-diurnal tide along the eastern Hopeless Reach,
   which increases the semi-diurnal tide by a factor of 2, the tidal
   characteristics on each of the Reaches are different: on the eastern
   Hopeless Reach the tides are mainly semi-diurnal while on the western
   Freycinet Reach the tides are mainly diurnal. The tidal range is also
   higher along Hopeless Reach. Tidal harmonics, generated by non-linearity,
   are important in the shallow regions. The tidal wave is shown to
   propagate as a progressive wave into the Bay. Substantial phase-lag,
   attenuation and dissipation occur over the Faure Sill, a major shallow
   region of the eastern reach of the Bay. Non-linear generation of the M 4
   and MS 4 tides is also significant in this region. Depth-averaged
   residual currents are presented, which show a tidally generated
   circulation that is enhanced in regions of complex topography. Estimates
   of tidal dissipation indicate that although the total dissipation is
   small on a global scale, the areal average is comparable with the Gulf of
   Carpentaria and approximately one-quarter of the value estimated for the
   Patagonian Shelf.

AB The presence and impacts of non-indigenous species (NIS) in marine areas
   of high conservation or World Heritage significance have rarely been
   examined. Case studies worldwide suggest that the potential exists for
   the introduction of NIS to significantly impact conservation values in
   regions conserved for the uniqueness and diversity of native assemblages.
   In this study, a preliminary investigation was conducted to provide
   information essential for managing marine introductions in the Shark Bay
   World Heritage Property. A focused fouling plate survey sampled a total
   of 112 encrusting taxa, of which 10 (11.2%) were classified as introduced
   and 10 others as cryptogenic. Eight introduced bryozoans: Aetea anguina
   (Linnaeus, 1758), Bugula neritina (Linnaeus, 1758), Bugula stolonifera
   Ryland, 1960, Conopeum seurati (Canu, 1928), Savignyella lafontii
   (Audouin, 1826), Schizoporella errata (Waters, 1878), Watersipora
   subtorquata (d’Orbigny, 1842) and Zoobotryon verticellatum della Chiaje,
   1828; one tunicate, Styela plicata Lesueur, 1823; and an introduced
   hydroid, Obelia dichotoma (Linnaeus, 1758) were frequent, and in some
   cases dominant, components of encrusting communities. Of the 20 most
   frequently occurring species detected in the Bay, four were introduced
   and of the 20 species with highest average percent cover per plate, six
   were introduced. At one site, space occupation by NIS averaged 71.6% ±
   7.4 of plate live cover. Space occupation by an individual NIS was as
   high as 62.4% of plate area (mean 7.82% ± 1.8). NIS were detected at
   sites lacking commercial traffic and ballast water discharge and isolated
   by distance and physical environment, suggesting that hull fouling of
   recreational craft may be the most important vector in the region.
   Seventy-five percent of NIS detected in Shark Bay are established in
   Australian ports to the south of Shark Bay, while 33% are established to
   the north, tentatively implicating temperate affinity NIS and the
   movement of vessels from Australian ports south of Shark Bay as a greater
   risk to the region.

AB Mounting evidence that sharks are being over-fished to supply shark fin
   markets is causing widespread concern about the sustainability of these
   practices. The basking shark Cetorhinus maximus, whose fins command high
   market prices, has proven especially sensitive to exploitation. To
   prevent further population declines, this species is now protected in the
   territorial waters of several countries, and is listed on Appendix II of
   the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES)
   requiring monitoring of trade in its products by all parties to CITES.
   Tracking trade in basking shark products, however, is often hampered by
   difficulties in identifying shark products to species of origin. Here, we
   present the development and application of a streamlined genetic
   forensics assay that does not require DNA sequencing to identify basking
   shark products. The dual-primer, species-specific polymerase chain
   reaction strategy provides diagnostic redundancy for robustness in legal
   venues. It is also effective for identifying basking shark products
   regardless of geographic origin, an important consideration, given the
   global distribution of the species and international sourcing of fins to
   the trade. Application of the assay confirmed the presence of basking
   shark fins in the Hong Kong and Japan markets, and indicated an apparent
   relationship between the Chinese fin trader category ‘Nuo Wei Tian Jiu’
   and fins from basking sharks. The assay was also used in a law
   enforcement investigation to document illegal trade in basking shark fins
   in the United States where this species is prohibited from harvest and
   trade. These trade detections suggest that the high market value of
   basking shark fins is continuing to drive the exploitation, surreptitious
   and otherwise, of this highly threatened species, underscoring the need
   for improved trade monitoring. The streamlined assay developed here can
   assist in monitoring and conservation on a worldwide scale.

AB Understanding the ontogenetic habitat linkages of sharks is important for
   conservation and managing human interactions. We used acoustic telemetry,
   catch data, elemental and stable isotope signatures and dietary analyses
   to investigate ontogenetic habitat use in south-east Queensland,
   Australia, by the bull shark Carcharhinus leucas, a IUCN
   'near-threatened' species that is implicated in many shark attacks on
   humans in urban estuaries. Sequential analyses for delta(15)N and
   delta(13)C of vertebrae from five adult C. leucas and laser ablation
   inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICPMS) for elemental
   composition from 23 C. leucas, including a pregnant female, were also
   used to trace ontogenetic habitat dependence. Acoustic telemetry
   indicated large juvenile and subadult C. leucas remained in estuarine
   habitats. delta(15)N values across shark vertebrae showed an ontogenetic
   shift in diet with total length (TL), confirmed by stomach contents.
   LA-ICPMS data reflected the ontogenetic movements of C. leucas from natal
   habitats. Differences among adults were gender related. Shifts in habitat
   use by subadults were correlated with a sigmoidal delta(13)C relationship
   with TL. C. leucas have a multipartite, stage-specific dependency in
   their transition between habitats along the freshwater-estuarine-marine
   continuum, making them particularly susceptible to the habitat alteration
   that is occurring globally.

   caught in the gill-nets which protect the tourist beaches of Natal. They
   represented 2,1 per cent of the total catch of sharks for this period,
   and the catch per unit effort ranged from 0,2 to 1,4
   sharks·km-net−1·year−1. The mean sex ratio for embryos was unity,
   compared with the 0,5 males: 1 female for free-swimming sharks. The
   length frequency distributions for both sexes were bimodal, the modes
   representing immature and mature sharks respectively. Males matured at
   about 1 290 mm precaudal length and females at 1 300 mm. Mating seemed to
   be taking place north of the netted region between late October and
   January, and the gestation period was about 12 months. There was a
   positive correlation between length of female and litter size, which
   averaged 7,2 embryos. The hepatosomic index of mature females was highest
   at the onset of pregnancy. Teleosts and cephalopods dominated the food in
   terms of frequency of occurrence.

AB As coral reef ecosystems come under increasing pressure from fisheries
   and climate change, understanding how species that rely on these habitats
   respond to changes within their environment is increasingly important.
   The presence and movement of 28 grey reef sharks Carcharhinus
   amblyrhynchos were monitored for 15 mo in the southern Great Barrier Reef
   in relation to environmental conditions and biological factors.
   Twenty-eight models including water temperature, atmospheric pressure,
   wind speed, rainfall and time (week or month), size and sex were tested
   against presence and activity space data and compared using Akaike
   information criterion (AIC). Model results for presence of individuals in
   relation to environmental conditions indicated that temperature and wind
   speed had weak effects, likely related to detectability. Models using 3
   different measures of activity space indicated no relationship between
   shark activity space and environmental parameters. Week was a significant
   factor in the top performing activity space models, with males showing
   increased activity space during weeks in September, when mating is
   believed to occur. These results suggest changes in movement were
   biologically rather than environmentally driven. It appears that C.
   amblyrhynchos are adapted to a wide range of environmental conditions in
   coral reef habitats and that movement between or away from reef platforms
   is likely related to biological factors such as prey density,
   competition, reproduction or dispersal rather than environmental or
   seasonal changes.

AB The attraction or provisioning of sharks for the purpose of tourism is a
   lucrative and popular industry that remains controversial regarding its
   possible risks to target species and impacts on local ecosystems. The
   long-term impacts of such activities on the behaviour and movement
   patterns of sharks have typically been difficult to establish as most
   studies investigate contemporary behaviour concurrent with existing
   operations and thus have no comparative base from which to compare
   effects. We compared patterns of residency and behaviour of
   acoustic-tagged white sharks at the Neptune Islands in South Australia
   between periods before and after an abrupt and sustained doubling of
   cage-diving effort that occurred in 2007. The number of sharks reported
   by cage-dive operators significantly increased after 2007. Comparisons
   also revealed there were significant increases in sharks’ periods of
   residency, the periods spent within areas where shark cage-diving
   operations occur and changes in sharks’ diel pattern of habitat use.
   Changes were site-specific with no significant differences in shark
   behaviour revealed over the same period at an island group 12 km from
   regular shark cage-dive sites. The results suggest that cage-diving
   operations can lead to long-term changes in the site-specific behaviour
   of a highly vagile shark species which may need to be considered in the
   context of their conservation and in managing the impacts of the
   industry.

AB Genetic diversity (θ), effective population size (Ne), and contemporary
   levels of gene flow are important parameters to estimate for species of
   conservation concern, such as the globally endangered scalloped
   hammerhead shark, Sphyrna lewini. Therefore, we have reconstructed the
   demographic history of S. lewini across its Eastern Pacific (EP) range by
   applying classical and coalescent population genetic methods to a
   combination of 15 microsatellite loci and mtDNA control region sequences.
   In addition to significant population genetic structure and
   isolation-by-distance among seven coastal sites between central Mexico
   and Ecuador, the analyses revealed that all populations have experienced
   a bottleneck and that all current values of θ are at least an order of
   magnitude smaller than ancestral θ, indicating large decreases in Ne (θ =
   4Neμ), where μ is the mutation rate. Application of the
   isolation-with-migration (IM) model showed modest but significant genetic
   connectivity between most sampled sites (point estimates of Nm =
   0.1–16.7), with divergence times (t) among all populations significantly
   greater than zero. Using a conservative (i.e., slow) fossil-based
   taxon-specific phylogenetic calibration for mtDNA mutation rates,
   posterior probability distributions (PPDs) for the onset of the decline
   in Ne predate modern fishing in this region. The cause of decline over
   the last several thousand years is unknown but is highly atypical as a
   post-glacial demographic history. Regardless of the cause, our data and
   analyses suggest that S. lewini was far more abundant throughout the EP
   in the past than at present.

AB Summary. Morphological features of the peripheral blood of the ancestral
   elasmo-branch Heterodontus portusjacksoni, a shark species, are
   described. The red cell is nucleated and contains many membrane-lined
   vacuoles which are derived from mitochondria. The granulocytic series
   resembles that of the mammals in appearance and in some phagocytic
   properties. The thrombocytes possess a number of similarities to
   mammalian platelets, but exhibit many differences. They aggregate
   readily, but this is temperature reversible and is independent of
   thrombin and ADP. They show a remarkable affinity for latex particles.
   Unlike many other species, fibrin formation and thrombocyte aggregation
   are apparently independent phenomena occurring in parallel rather than in
   series. Tritiated thymidine studies and the observation of mitotic
   figures in the peripheral blood suggest that at least part of the red
   cell and thrombocyte proliferation occurs in the circulating blood.

AB Cartilaginous fish are the oldest animals that generate RAG-based Ag
   receptor diversity. We have analyzed the genes and expressed transcripts
   of the four TCR chains for the first time in a cartilaginous fish, the
   nurse shark (Ginglymostoma cirratum). Northern blotting found TCR mRNA
   expression predominantly in lymphoid and mucosal tissues. Southern
   blotting suggested translocon-type loci encoding all four chains. Based
   on diversity of V and J segments, the expressed combinatorial diversity
   for γ is similar to that of human, α and β may be slightly lower, and δ
   diversity is the highest of any organism studied to date. Nurse shark
   TCRδ have long CDR3 loops compared with the other three chains, creating
   binding site topologies comparable to those of mammalian TCR in basic
   paratope structure; additionally, nurse shark TCRδ CDR3 are more similar
   to IgH CDR3 in length and heterogeneity than to other TCR chains. Most
   interestingly, several cDNAs were isolated that contained IgM or IgW V
   segments rearranged to other gene segments of TCRδ and α. Finally, in
   situ hybridization experiments demonstrate a conservation of both α/β and
   γ/δ T cell localization in the thymus across 450 million years of
   vertebrate evolution, with γ/δ TCR expression especially high in the
   subcapsular region. Collectively, these data make the first cellular
   identification of TCR-expressing lymphocytes in a cartilaginous fish.

AB Abstract The immunoglobulin new antigen receptors (IgNARs) are a class of
   Ig-like molecules of the shark immune system that exist as heavy
   chain-only homodimers and bind antigens by their single domain variable
   regions (V-NARs). Following shark immunization and/or in vitro selection,
   V-NARs can be generated as soluble, stable, and specific high affinity
   monomeric binding proteins of ∼12 kDa. We have previously isolated a
   V-NAR from an immunized spiny dogfish shark, named E06, that binds
   specifically and with high affinity to human, mouse, and rat serum
   albumins. Humanization of E06 was carried out by converting over 60% of
   non-complementarity-determining region residues to those of a human germ
   line Vκ1 sequence, DPK9. The resulting huE06 molecules have largely
   retained the specificity and affinity of antigen binding of the parental
   V-NAR. Crystal structures of the shark E06 and its humanized variant
   (huE06 v1.1) in complex with human serum albumin (HSA) were determined at
   3- and 2.3-A resolution, respectively. The huE06 v1.1 molecule retained
   all but one amino acid residues involved in the binding site for HSA.
   Structural analysis of these V-NARs has revealed an unusual variable
   domain-antigen interaction. E06 interacts with HSA in an atypical mode
   that utilizes extensive framework contacts in addition to
   complementarity-determining regions that has not been seen previously in
   V-NARs. On the basis of the structure, the roles of various elements of
   the molecule are described with respect to antigen binding and V-NAR
   stability. This information broadens the general understanding of antigen
   recognition and provides a framework for further design and humanization
   of shark IgNARs.

AB The anatomy of the feeding apparatus of the nurse shark, Ginglymostoma
   cirratum, was investigated by gross dissection and computer axial
   tomography. The labial cartilages, jaws, jaw suspension, muscles, and
   ligaments of the head are described. Palatoquadrate cartilages articulate
   with the chondrocranium caudally by short, laterally projecting
   hyomandibu- lae and rostrally by ethmoorbital articulations. Short
   orbital processes of the palatoquadrates are joined to the ethmoid region
   of the chondrocranium by short, thin ethmopalatine ligaments. In
   addition, various ligaments, muscles, and the integument contribute to
   the suspension of the jaws. When the mouth is closed and the
   palatoquadrate retracted, the palatine process of the palato- quadrate is
   braced against the ventral surface of the nasal capsule and the ascending
   process of the palatoquadrate is in contact with the rostrodorsal end of
   the suborbital shelf. When the mandible is depressed and the palato-
   quadrate protrudes slightly rostroventrally, the palatoquadrate moves
   away from the chondrocranium. A dual articulation of the
   quadratomandibular joint restricts lateral movement between the mandible
   and the palatoquad- rate. The vertically oriented preorbitalis muscle
   spans the gape and is hypothesized to contribute to the generation of
   powerful crushing forces for its hard prey. The attachment of the
   preorbitalis to the prominent labial carti- lages is also hypothesized to
   assist in the retraction of the labial cartilages during jaw closure.
   Separate levator palatoquadrati and spiracularis muscles, which are
   longitudinally oriented and attach the chondrocranium to the
   palatoquadrate, are hypothesized to assist in the retraction of the
   palatoquad- rate during the recovery phase of feeding kinematics.
   Morphological special- izations for suction feeding that contribute to
   large subambient suction pressures include hypertrophied coracohyoideus
   and coracobranchiales muscles to depress the hyoid and branchial arches,
   a small oral aperture with well-developed labial cartilages that occlude
   the gape laterally, and small teeth. J. Morphol. 241:33-60, 1999. r 1999

   described and related to the arrangements of afferents from retina,
   telencephalon and contralateral tectum. Its lamination is not pronounced
   when compared to tecta of most other non-mammalian species but more
   comparable to those of mammals. The absence of highly differentiated
   cells such as pyramidal and true horizontal cells is perhaps correlated
   with the poor differentiation in general, including the apparent partial
   overlap of inputs. Some neurons near the midline were found to possess
   dendrites extending into the contralateral tectum.

   Victoria, Australia, in April and May 1998. The elements As, Ca, Cd, Cu,
   Fe, Hg, K, Mg, Mn, Na, Sr, and Zn were detected in the muscle tissue. The
   concentrations of Al, Ba, Be, Cr, Mo, Ni, Pb, and V were below the
   detection limits of the instrumental techniques employed (ICP-ES and
   GF-AAS). However, significant concentration differences between species
   were detected for As, Cd, Hg, and Zn. C. owstoni contained the highest
   concentrations of each of these elements. The concentrations of Cu, Pb,
   and Zn in each species were below the maximum levels permitted in food by
   the Australian Food Standards Code. The maximum permitted concentrations
   of As and Hg were exceeded in all species, and weekly consumption of 400
   g of any of these sharks would result in intake of more than the FAO's
   provisional tolerable weekly intake. Although C. crepidator and D. calcea
   have strong relationships between length and mercury concentration, C.
   owstoni does not. Placing C. crepidator and C. owstoni in the same genus,
   therefore, is worth re-examination as the mechanisms for controlling

AB The Queensland Shark Control Program (QSCP) aims to protect swimmers at

   nets and baited drumlines in a `mixed gear strategy' that adapts the type
   of gear to the characteristics of a site (e .g . extreme tidal range,
   high energy wave action, or proximity of turtle breeding areas) . The
   policy has provided swimmer protection, and the incidental capture of
   non-target species has been lower than that resulting from deployment of
   nets alone (Dudley 1997; Gribble et al. 1998b). The QSCP is the only
   major public-safety shark-control program to routinely use mixed gear.
   Both the New South Wales (Holt 1998) and KwaZulu-Natal (Dudley 1998)

AB : In the north-west Atlantic Ocean, stock assessments conducted for some

   with respect to virgin population levels. While the status of
   commercially important species is available, abundance trend information
   for other coastal shark species in the north-west Atlantic Ocean are
   unavailable. Using a generalized linear modelling (GLM) approach, a
   relative abundance index was derived from 1994 to 2009 using observer
   data collected in a commercial bottom longline fishery. Trends in
   abundance and average size were estimated for bull shark Carcharhinus
   leucas, spinner shark Carcharhinus brevipinna, tiger shark Galeocerdo
   cuvier and lemon shark Negaprion brevirostris. Increases in relative
   abundance for all shark species ranged from 14% for C. brevipinna, 12%
   for C. leucas, 6% for N. brevirostris and 3% for G. cuvier. There was no
   significant change in the size at capture over the time period considered
   for all species. While the status of shark populations should not be
   based exclusively on abundance trend information, but ultimately on stock
   assessment models, results from this study provide some cause for
   optimism on the status of these coastal shark species.

AB Abstract Immunoglobulin new antigen receptors (IgNARs) are unique single
   domain antibodies found in the serum of sharks. The individual variable
   (VNAR) domains bind antigen independently and are candidates for the
   smallest antibody-based immune recognition units (∼13 kDa). Here, we
   first isolated and sequenced the cDNA of a mature IgNAR antibody from the
   spotted wobbegong shark (Orectolobus maculatus) and confirmed the
   independent nature of the VNAR domains by dynamic light scattering.
   Second, we asked which of the reported antibody fragment dimerisation
   strategies could be applied to VNAR domains to produce small bivalent
   proteins with high functional affinity (avidity). In contrast to single
   chain Fv (scFv) fragments, separate IgNARs could not be linked into a
   tandem single chain format, with the resulting proteins exhibited only
   monovalent binding due solely to interaction of the N-terminal domain
   with antigen. Similarly, incorporation of C-terminal helix–turn–helix
   (dhlx) motifs, while resulting in efficiently dimerised protein, resulted
   in only a modest enhancement of affinity, probably due to an
   insufficiently long hinge region linking the antibody to the dhlx motif.
   Finally, generation of mutants containing half-cystine residues at the
   VNAR C-terminus produced dimeric recombinant proteins exhibiting high
   functional affinity for the target antigens, but at the cost of 50-fold
   decreased protein expression levels. This study demonstrates the
   potential for construction of bivalent or bispecific IgNAR-based binding
   reagents of relatively small size (∼26 kDa), equivalent to a monovalent
   antibody Fv fragment, for formulation into future diagnostic and
   therapeutic formats.

AB Modern microbial mats are potential analogues of some of Earth’s earliest
   ecosystems. Excellent examples can be found in Shark Bay, Australia, with
   mats of various morphologies. To further our understanding of the
   functional genetic potential of these complex microbial ecosystems, we
   conducted for the first time shotgun metagenomic analyses. We assembled
   metagenomic next-generation sequencing data to classify the taxonomic and
   metabolic potential across diverse morphologies of marine mats in Shark
   Bay. The microbial community across taxonomic classifications using
   protein-coding and small subunit rRNA genes directly extracted from the
   metagenomes suggests that three phyla Proteobacteria, Cyanobacteria and
   Bacteriodetes dominate all marine mats. However, the microbial community
   structure between Shark Bay and Highbourne Cay (Bahamas) marine systems
   appears to be distinct from each other. The metabolic potential (based on
   SEED subsystem classifications) of the Shark Bay and Highbourne Cay
   microbial communities were also distinct. Shark Bay metagenomes have a
   metabolic pathway profile consisting of both heterotrophic and
   photosynthetic pathways, whereas Highbourne Cay appears to be dominated
   almost exclusively by photosynthetic pathways. Alternative
   non-rubisco-based carbon metabolism including reductive TCA cycle and
   3-hydroxypropionate/4-hydroxybutyrate pathways is highly represented in
   Shark Bay metagenomes while not represented in Highbourne Cay microbial
   mats or any other mat forming ecosystems investigated to date.
   Potentially novel aspects of nitrogen cycling were also observed, as well
   as putative heavy metal cycling (arsenic, mercury, copper and cadmium).
   Finally, archaea are highly represented in Shark Bay and may have
   critical roles in overall ecosystem function in these modern microbial
   mats.

AB Understanding how moving organisms generate locomotor forces is
   fundamental to the analysis of aerodynamic and hydrodynamic flow patterns
   that are generated during body and appendage oscillation. In the past,
   this has been accomplished using two-dimensional planar techniques that
   require reconstruction of three-dimensional flow patterns. We have
   applied a new, fully three-dimensional, volumetric imaging technique that
   allows instantaneous capture of wake flow patterns, to a classic problem
   in functional vertebrate biology: the function of the asymmetrical
   (heterocercal) tail of swimming sharks to capture the vorticity field
   within the volume swept by the tail. These data were used to test a
   previous three-dimensional reconstruction of the shark vortex wake
   estimated from two-dimensional flow analyses, and show that the
   volumetric approach reveals a different vortex wake not previously
   reconstructed from two-dimensional slices. The hydrodynamic wake consists
   of one set of dual-linked vortex rings produced per half tail beat. In
   addition, we use a simple passive shark-tail model under robotic control
   to show that the three-dimensional wake flows of the robotic tail differ
   from the active tail motion of a live shark, suggesting that active
   control of kinematics and tail stiffness plays a substantial role in the
   production of wake vortical patterns.

   Somniosus pacificus. The fish were tagged near Steller sea lion
   Eumetopias jubatus rookeries in the Gulf of Alaska during periods when
   Steller sea lions pups were most vulnerable to predation; when Steller
   sea lion pups first enter the water (July to August) and when Steller sea
   lion pups are weaned (April to May). Final locations recovered from most
   Pacific sleeper sharks (76%) were within 100 km of release locations, 16%
   were within 100-250 km and 8% were within 250-500 km. The most striking
   behavioural feature was their extensive, nearly continuous vertical
   movements. Median daily depth range was 184 m; the most time (61 %) was
   spent between 150 and 450 m, but ascents above 100 m were common (58% of
   days). Median vertical movement rate was 6 km day -1 and steady. The
   longest period of continuous vertical movement (> 60 m h -1 ) was 330 h.
   Systematic vertical oscillations were most common (60%), followed by diel
   vertical migrations (25%) and irregular vertical movements (15%). The
   Pacific sleeper sharks travelled below the photic zone during the day and
   approached the surface at night. Pacific sleeper sharks appear to employ
   a stealth and ambush hunting strategy that incorporates slow vertical
   oscillations to search for prey, and cryptic colouration and cover of
   darkness to avoid detection by potential prey. The depth and geographic
   range of Pacific sleeper shark and Steller sea lions overlap near four
   important Steller sea lion rookeries in the northern Gulf of Alaska, so
   the potential exists for predation to occur. None of the tissues in the
   stomachs of the 198 Pacific sleeper sharks collected during a companion
   diet study, however, were identified as Steller sea lion.

AB The three-dimensional structure of parvalbumin from leopard shark
   (Triakis semifasciata) with 109 amino acid residues (alpha-series) is
   described at 1.54 A resolution. Crystals were grown at 20 degrees C from
   2.9 M-potassium/sodium phosphate solutions at pH 5.6. The space group is
   P3(1)21 and unit cell dimensions are a = b = 32.12 A and c = 149.0 A. The
   structure has been solved by the molecular replacement method using pike
   4.10 parvalbumin as a model. The final structure refinement resulted in
   an R-factor of 17.3% for 11,363 independent reflections at 1.54 A
   resolution. The shark parvalbumin shows the main features of all
   parvalbumins: the folding of the chain including six alpha-helices, the
   salt bridge between Arg75 and Glu81, and the hydrophobic core. Compared
   to the structure of beta-parvalbumins from pike and carp, one main
   difference is observed: the chain is one residue longer and this
   additional residue, which extends the F helix, is involved through its
   C-terminal carboxylate group in a network of electrostatic contacts with
   two basic residues, His31 in the B helix and Lys36 in the BC segment.
   Furthermore, hydrogen bonds exist between the side-chains of Gln108 (F
   helix) and Tyr26 (B helix). There is therefore a "locking" of the
   tertiary structure through contacts between two sequentially distant
   regions in the protein and this is likely to contribute to making the
   stability of an alpha-parvalbumin higher in comparison to that of a
   beta-parvalbumin. The lengthening of the C-terminal F helix by one
   residue appears to be a major feature of alpha-parvalbumins in general,
   owing to the homologies of the amino acid sequences. Besides the
   lengthening of the C-terminal helix, the classification of the leopard
   shark parvalbumin in the alpha-series rests upon the observation of
   Lys13, Leu32, Glu61 and Val66. As this is the first crystal structure
   description of a parvalbumin from the alpha-phylogenetic lineage, it was
   hoped that it would clearly determine the presence or absence of a third
   cation binding site in parvalbumins belonging to the alpha-lineage. In
   beta-pike pI 4.10 parvalbumin, Asp61 participates as a direct ligand of a
   third site, the satellite of the CD site. In shark parvalbumin, as in
   nearly all alpha-parvalbumins, one finds Glu at position 61.
   Unfortunately, the conformation of the polar head of Glu61 cannot be
   inferred from the X-ray data.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)

AB Depredation by cetaceans and sharks on longline fisheries is a global
   issue that can have negative impacts on both animals and fisheries and
   has concerned researchers, managers and the fishing industry.
   Nevertheless, detailed information on depredation is only available for a
   few regions where the problem exists. With the purpose of evaluating
   killer whale depredation on longline-caught tuna ( Thunnus spp.) and
   swordfish ( Xiphias gladius ) in the waters off southern and
   south-eastern Brazil and comparing it to shark depredation, data sheets
   were distributed to the captains of tuna vessels in Santos, south-eastern
   Brazil, between 1993 and 1995. Data on the catch per unit effort (CPUE)
   of tuna and swordfish and some records of interactions were also obtained
   from fishing vessel logbooks. Dockside interviews with fishermen and with
   researchers on board tuna vessels provided additional information. Killer
   whale and shark interactions were analysed per longline set and per trip.
   Killer whale interactions occurred from June to February, mainly between
   June and October, while shark interactions occurred year round. The
   number of sets and trips involving shark interactions was significantly
   higher than the number of sets and trips involving killer whale
   interactions. However, when depredation occurred, the proportion of fish
   damaged by killer whales was significantly higher than by sharks.
   Furthermore, killer whales removed or damaged significantly more hooked
   swordfish than hooked tuna, whereas sharks damaged significantly more
   hooked tuna than swordfish. This study also shows that cetacean by-catch
   is experienced by the tuna and swordfish longline fishery in Brazilian
   waters.

AB Differential screening has been used to identify cDNAs encoding a long
   form of IgX in Raja eglanteria (clearnose skate). Comparisons of the IgX
   long form with the previously described short-form IgX cDNAs and the
   genomic IgX locus indicate that the V and two 5′C regions of the short
   and long forms of IgX are >90% identical at the nucleotide level.
   Differences between the V sequences of the long- and short-form IgX genes
   are concentrated in complementarity determining regions, suggesting that
   these forms are derived through alternative splicing of the same genomic
   loci or transcription of highly related loci. The extreme conservation of
   nucleotide sequence, including third position codons, among different
   cDNAs as well as the near identity of nucleotide sequence in the
   intervening sequences of germline IgX, IgX short-form sterile transcripts
   and IgX long-form sterile transcripts indicate that the multiple IgX loci
   are recently diverged from one another and/or are under intense gene
   correction. Phylogenetic analyses of the known cartilaginous fish
   immunoglobulin loci demonstrate that the long form of IgX is orthologous
   to IgW/IgNARC (NARC) and is most consistent with: 1) the divergence of
   the IgX/IgW/NARC and IgM-like loci from a common ancestral locus prior to
   the divergence of the cartilaginous/bony fish lineages and 2) the
   divergence of the NAR locus from the IgX/IgW/NARC gene(s) after the
   cartilaginous/bony fish split but prior to the shark/skate split,
   approximately 220 million years ago.

   of the South Ari Atoll, Maldives Archi- pelago. We recorded the length
   and sex of each shark observed and made photographs to facilitate
   repeated identification from their spot patterns using
   pattern-recognition software. We identified 64 whale sharks from digital
   photographs taken during 220 sightings over 3 yr. Approx. 87% of those
   sharks were immature males. The average length of recognisable sharks was
   5.98 m (range 2.5 to 10.5 m), significantly shorter than that reported
   for whale sharks in other aggregations in the Indian Ocean. Our findings
   suggest that these sharks are either a small proportion of a local
   population or perhaps an even smaller component of a regional population
   in the western Indian Ocean. We applied a Lincoln-Petersen
   closed-population mark-recapture model and a Jolly-Seber open- population

AB The Devono-Carboniferous chondrichthyan Stethacanthus is best known for
   its striking 'spine-brush' complex. Here we provide the first detailed
   description of the neurocranium, using several well-preserved specimens
   from Bearsden, Scotland (Serpukhovian; Pendleian E1). Significant
   features include an otico-occipital region of about the same length as
   the ethmosphenoid division; short but distinct lateral otic processes; a
   short, broad endolymphatic fossa; a persistent otico-occipital fissure;
   Y-shaped basicranial canals indicating origin of the lateral aortae
   anterior to the occipital level; and minimal suborbital shelves limited
   to small, ethmoidally located outgrowths. Using placoderm, osteichthyan
   and acanthodian neurocrania for outgroup comparison, PAUP analysis of a
   matrix of 23 neurocranial characters produced the following branching
   sequence: (Helodus (Stethacanthus, Cobelodus (Tamiobatis (Xenacanthus
   (Cladodus wildungensis (Tristychius, Hybodus)))))). The location of
   Cladoselache in this analysis is uncertain and probably results from
   missing data and a morphologically restricted character set.
   Plesiomorphic conditions for chondrichthyan braincases are found to
   include the presence of a persistent otico-occipital fissure, projection
   of the median dorsal aorta anterior to the occipital level, and absence
   of suborbital shelves. These results may have important implications with
   regard to primitive gnathostome interrelationships, and especially the
   phylogenetic position of placoderms.

   punctures and a circular indentation in the shell. These punctures are
   interpreted as representing an attack on the nautiloid by a cladodontid
   shark, most likely by the large symmoriid shark, Symmorium reniforme. We
   conclude that the punctures in the nautiloid body chamber were inflicted
   by three teeth in a single tooth file in the lower jaw of a specimen of

   the chondrichthyans that diverged from the rest of the gnathostome (jawed
   vertebrate) lineage about 450 million years ago and the first
   chondrichthyan with a genome project. We have identified two peptide
   genes that are orthologous to NPY and PYY (peptide YY) in other
   vertebrates, and seven receptor genes orthologous to the Y1, Y2, Y4, Y5,
   Y6, Y7 and Y8 subtypes found in tetrapods and teleost fishes. The
   repertoire of peptides and receptors seems to reflect the ancestral
   configuration in the predecessor of all gnathostomes, whereas other
   lineages such as mammals and teleosts have lost one or more receptor
   genes or have acquired 1–2 additional peptide genes. Both the peptides
   and receptors showed broad and overlapping mRNA expression which may
   explain why some receptor gene losses could take place in some lineages,
   but leaves open the question why all the known ancestral receptors have
   been retained in the elephant shark.

AB Abstract The bamboo shark Chiloscyllium plagiosum is an abundant benthic
   species along the shallow continental shelf of Southeast Asia. It is
   commonly taken by fishermen in China, India, Taiwan and Thailand for
   human consumption. This study measured trace metal and organochlorine
   concentrations in C. plagiosum collected from the southern waters of Hong
   Kong, China. Metals (Ag, Cd, Cr, Cu, Mn, Ni, Pb and Zn) were measured in
   three different tissues: dorsal muscle, spleen and liver. Polychlorinated
   biphenyls (PCBs) and chlorinated pesticides in the dorsal muscle were
   identified and quantified using gas chromatography. Metal concentrations
   varied among the three different tissues, with liver having higher levels
   of Ag and Cd, and spleen possessing higher levels of Cu and Mn. Both Ni
   and Pb in all tissues were below the detection limit. Tissue
   concentrations of Cr, Cu, Mn and Zn generally decreased with increasing
   body weight whilst no significant concentration-size relationship was
   found for other metals. In muscle tissues, total PCBs ranged from
   1.056–4.771 ng/g (wet wt.) with a median of 1.801 ng/g, while total DDTs
   ranged from 0.602–23.55 ng/g with a median of 1.109 ng/g, in which p , p
   ′-DDE was the predominant metabolite. Levels of total hexachlorohexanes
   and cyclodienes were low. The pesticide p , p ′-DDT was the only compound
   found to be positively correlated with body weight, indicating temporal
   bioaccumulation of this compound. Zn concentrations in the muscle of C.
   plagiosum were comparatively higher than recorded in other shark species,
   however, concentrations of other metals and organochlorines were
   relatively low. C. plagiosum feeds primarily on polychaetes, shrimps and
   small fishes, and thus is unlikely to contain levels of contaminants of
   human health concern.

AB The Upper Marine Molasse sediments of southern Germany were deposited
   during the Early to Middle Miocene, a period of significant change for
   the global Miocene palaeoceanography, palaeoclimate, and the regional
   palaeogeography because of the ongoing Alpine–Himalayan orogeny. To
   address the influence of the Alpine uplift on climate and oceanography of
   the northern Alpine molasse basin, a combined O-, Sr-, and Nd-isotope
   study was undertaken on fossil teeth from sharks (Synodontaspis sp.,
   Galeocerdo cf. aduncus, Chaenogaleus sp.), and button-like teeth from the
   bony fish of the Upper Marine Molasse (Chrysophrys molassica). Average
   δ18O values for hydroxyapatite of teeth from two sites are 20.3‰ (1σ=0.6)
   and 21.2‰ (1σ=0.5), while their average 87Sr/86Sr and 143Nd/144Nd ratios
   are 0.70850 (±0.00001, 2σ) and 0.70882 (±0.00003, 2σ), and 0.51220, and
   0.51223 (both at ±0.00001, 2σ), respectively. By comparison to the
   Sr-evolution curve for the global ocean, the Sr-isotope compositions
   suggest ages of about 22 and 17 Ma for the teeth. These ages are in good
   agreement with the depositional ages, which suggests open marine
   conditions. Open marine conditions are also compatible with (1) lower
   average δ18O values and 87Sr/86Sr ratios for the one site compared to
   higher δ18O values and higher 87Sr/86Sr ratios for the other site, (2)
   estimates for seawater temperatures which are similar to other estimates
   from deposits of similar latitude and age, (3) a comparison of seawater
   temperatures with average ambient air temperature estimates deduced from
   continental palaeoclimate indicators. Nd-isotope compositions are
   compatible with an influence of the North Atlantic on the Paratethys.
   Assuming constant salinity and seawater oxygen isotope composition, a 4°C
   cooling can be inferred from average δ18O values of the teeth between 22
   and 17 Ma. This is similar to trends observed for foraminiferal records
   from the Mediterranean Tethys, but different from foraminiferal and
   molluscan records of the North Atlantic and the North Sea during this
   period, and allows for the possibility that the Alpine orogeny had an
   influence on the regional, circum-Alpine climate.

AB Public feelings toward sharks are expected to grow negatively following
   shark bites on humans. Media and government responses are often
   predicated on this presumptive emotional response; however, there have
   been no published data on attitudes toward sharks following shark bite
   incidents. This study shows that levels of “pride” in white shark
   populations in the absence of an incident remained steady after a shark
   bite occurred. This was consistent across response areas regarding other
   marine life and “confidence” in beach safety programs. Results are based
   on a pilot survey conducted in the Cape Town beach suburbs of Fish Hoek
   and Muizenberg before and after a shark bite at Fish Hoek beach. The
   study found no statistical significance between survey responses and the
   occurrence of the shark bite incident. The results indicate a previously
   undocumented level of public sophistication following these events. This
   data challenges the underlying basis of policy responses to shark bites
   and suggests that new considerations of public knowledge, endemic value
   and causal narratives should be incorporated into decision making.

   reported previously as unsaturated counterparts obtained after digestion

   their lipid-derivatives to investigate the binding specificity of four
   commercial anti-chondroitin sulfate antibodies CS-56, MO-225, 2H6, and

   recognized by each antibody, which implies that the common conformation
   shared by the multiple primary sequences in the intact chondroitin
   sulfate chains is important as an epitope for each monoclonal antibody.
   Comparison of the specificity of the tested antibodies indicates that
   CS-56 and MO-225 specifically recognize octasaccharides containing an A-D
   tetrasaccharide sequence, whereas 2H6 and LY111 require a hexasaccharide
   as a minimum size for their binding, and prefer sequences with A- and

   This species has been a totally protected species in the State of New
   South Wales since 1984 and, as far as is known, was the first protected
   shark in the world. 2. Aspects discussed include systematics and
   taxonomy, distribution and biogeography, morphology and behaviour,
   reproduction and migrations, feeding habits, fisheries value and claims
   of attacks on humans, and impacts of protective beach meshing,
   spearfishing and SCUBA diving. The background to, and history of, moves
   to protect and conserve the species in New South Wales waters are also
   covered. 3. Results of surveys of the abundance of this species at Seal
   Rocks, an area off the mid-north coast of New South Wales where grey
   nurse sharks are known to aggregate, are reported. Also, a summary of the
   results of a telephone survey of commercial dive shop operators regarding
   the occurrence of grey nurse sharks along the New South Wales coastline
   is presented. 4. Finally, recommendations are made concerning the need
   for further research on, and management of, this species in Australian
   waters.

   by increased incorporation of tritiated thymidine. Separation by means of
   Ficoll-Isopaque yields two or more bands and a sediment, all of which
   contain lymphocytes responsive to Con A. Only the bottom cells react to
   phytohemagglutinin (PHA). This reaction cannot be detected in the
   unseparated lymphocyte population. Thus, only a unique subset of
   lymphocytes appears to be responsive to PHA and is probably blocked in
   its response by other cells. The findings suggest that differentiation
   toward Con A responsiveness may have preceded phylogenetically the
   responsiveness to PHA. Judging by the requirement for high concentrations
   of both mitogens the receptor sites on shark lymphocytes appear to be
   present in lower densities than on lymphocytes of higher vertebrates.

   two databases. Images taken by tourists were compiled from online
   databases. Researcher and public databases were analysed separately and
   the results of mark–recapture models then compared. Key results The
   dataset constructed from online public databases did not violate the
   assumptions of mark–recapture modelling. Estimates of parameters and
   abundance obtained from models using these data were similar to those
   produced using data provided by experienced researchers. Conclusions
   Publically sourced data allowed for the accurate estimation of abundance
   of whale sharks. These estimates were not confounded by the suitability
   of photographs, probably because of the high encounter rate in the
   aggregation, the high residency rate of sharks and the retrospective
   nature of photo-identification, which limited heterogeneity in capture
   probability between marked and unmarked sharks. Implications Our findings
   support the use of publically sourced data for use in mark–recapture
   studies of whale sharks, at least in situations where sharks are resident
   to the location. This approach will be useful in regions where data
   collected by tourists are available online, and research funding is
   limited.

AB Management and conservation of the North Atlantic blue shark are
   handicapped by a fishery-data-limited stock-assessment process. The
   status of this stock is ambiguous at a time when catch appears to be on
   the rise and new trade and exploitation patterns are emerging. This
   research provides fishery-independent demographic and risk analysis
   results for use in conservation and management. An age-structured matrix
   population model in which the vital rates are stochastic was constructed.
   A mean finite rate of population increase (λ) of 1.23 year–1 and a mean
   population doubling time (t2) of 3.08 years suggests that the blue shark
   is one of the most productive shark species. However, this concept of
   high productivity could be misleading because an elasticity analysis
   shows a strong dependence of the population growth rate on the survival
   of juveniles (0–4 years). An analysis of the risk that the harvested
   population will decline to levels below an assumed threshold of 50% of
   pre-exploited levels was conducted. The risk analysis is proposed as a
   supplement to the data-limited stock assessment, to better evaluate the
   probability that a given management strategy will put the population at
   risk of decline.

AB The cartilaginous fishes reside at the base of the gnathostome lineage as
   the oldest extant group of jawed vertebrates. Recently, the genome of the
   elephant shark, Callorhinchus milii, a chimaerid holocephalan, has been
   sequenced and therefore becomes the first cartilaginous fish to be
   analyzed in this way. The chimaeras have been largely neglected and very
   little is known about the visual systems of these fishes. By searching
   the elephant shark genome, we have identified gene fragments encoding a
   rod visual pigment, Rh1, and three cone visual pigments, the middle
   wavelength-sensitive or Rh2 pigment, and two isoforms of the long
   wavelength-sensitive or LWS pigment, LWS1 and LWS2, but no evidence for
   the two short wavelength-sensitive cone classes, SWS1 and SWS2.
   Expression of these genes in the retina was confirmed by RT-PCR.
   Full-length coding sequences were used for in vitro expression and gave
   the following peak absorbances: Rh1 496 nm, Rh2 442 nm, LWS1 499 nm, and
   LWS2 548 nm. Unusually, therefore, for a deep-sea fish, the elephant
   shark possesses cone pigments and the potential for trichromacy. Compared
   with other vertebrates, the elephant shark Rh2 and LWS1 pigments are the
   shortest wavelength-shifted pigments of their respective classes known to
   date. The mechanisms for this are discussed and we provide experimental
   evidence that the elephant shark LWS1 pigment uses a novel tuning
   mechanism to achieve the short wavelength shift to 499 nm, which
   inactivates the chloride-binding site. Our findings have important
   implications for the present knowledge of color vision evolution in early
   vertebrates.

AB Sharks are one of the most threatened groups of marine animals worldwide,
   mostly owing to overfishing and habitat degradation/loss. Although these
   cartilaginous fish have evolved to fill many ecological niches across a
   wide range of habitats, they have limited capability to rapidly adapt to
   human-induced changes in their environments. Contrary to global warming,
   ocean acidification was not considered as a direct climate-related threat
   to sharks. Here we show, for the first time, that an early ontogenetic
   acclimation process of a tropical shark ( Chiloscyllium punctatum ) to
   the projected scenarios of ocean acidification (ΔpH = 0.5) and warming
   (+4°C; 30°C) for 2100 elicited significant impairments on juvenile shark
   condition and survival. The mortality of shark embryos at the present-day
   thermal scenarios was 0% both at normocapnic and hypercapnic conditions.
   Yet routine metabolic rates (RMRs) were significantly affected by
   temperature, pH and embryonic stage. Immediately after hatching, the
   Fulton condition of juvenile bamboo sharks was significantly different in
   individuals that experienced future warming and hypercapnia; 30 days
   after hatching, survival rapidly declined in individuals experiencing
   both ocean warming and acidification (up to 44%). The RMR of juvenile
   sharks was also significantly affected by temperature and pH. The impact
   of low pH on ventilation rates was significant only under the higher
   thermal scenario. This study highlights the need of experimental-based
   risk assessments of sharks to climate change. In other words, it is
   critical to directly assess risk and vulnerability of sharks to ocean
   acidification and warming, and such effort can ultimately help managers
   and policy-makers to take proactive measures targeting most endangered
   species.

AB Hypoxia and warm ischemia are primary concerns in ischemic heart disease
   and transplant and trauma. Hypoxia impacts tissue ATP supply and can
   induce mitochondrial dysfunction that elevates reactive species release.
   The epaulette shark, Hemiscyllum ocellatum, is remarkably tolerant of
   severe hypoxia at temperatures up to 34°C, and therefore provides a
   valuable model to study warm hypoxia tolerance. Mitochondrial function
   was tested in saponin permeabilised ventricle fibres using
   high-resolution respirometry coupled with purpose-built
   fluorospectrometers. Ventricular mitochondrial function, stability and
   reactive species production of the epaulette shark was compared with that
   of the hypoxia-sensitive shovelnose ray, Aptychotrema rostrata. Fibres
   were prepared from each species acclimated to normoxic water conditions,
   or following a 2 h, acute hypoxic exposure at levels representing 40% of
   each species’ critical oxygen tension. Although mitochondrial respiratory
   fluxes for normoxia-acclimated animals were similar for both species,
   reactive species production in the epaulette shark was approximately half
   that of the shovelnose ray under normoxic conditions, even when
   normalised to tissue oxidative phosphorylation flux. The
   hypoxia-sensitive shovelnose ray halved oxidative phosphorylation flux
   and cytochrome c oxidase flux was depressed by 34% following hypoxic
   stress. In contrast, oxidative phosphorylation flux of the epaulette
   shark ventricular fibres isolated from acute hypoxia exposed the animals
   remained similar to those from normoxia-acclimated animals. However,
   uncoupling of respiration revealed depressed electron transport systems
   in both species following hypoxia exposure. Overall, the epaulette shark
   ventricular mitochondria showed greater oxidative phosphorylation
   stability and lower reactive species outputs with hypoxic exposure, and
   this may protect cardiac bioenergetic function in hypoxic tropical
   waters.

AB Efforts to conserve globally declining herbivorous green sea turtles have
   resulted in promising growth of some populations. These trends could
   significantly impact critical ecosystem services provided by seagrass
   meadows on which turtles feed. Expanding turtle populations could improve
   seagrass ecosystem health by removing seagrass biomass and preventing of
   the formation of sediment anoxia. However, overfishing of large sharks,
   the primary green turtle predators, could facilitate turtle populations
   growing beyond historical sizes and trigger detrimental ecosystem impacts
   mirroring those on land when top predators were extirpated. Experimental
   data from multiple ocean basins suggest that increasing turtle
   populations can negatively impact seagrasses, including triggering
   virtual ecosystem collapse. Impacts of large turtle populations on
   seagrasses are reduced in the presence of intact shark populations.
   Healthy populations of sharks and turtles, therefore, are likely vital to
   restoring or maintaining seagrass ecosystem structure, function, and
   their value in supporting fisheries and as a carbon sink.

   from 115 (s.e. 5.2, 95% CI 105–126) individuals in 2008 to 208 (s.e.
   17.3, 95% CI 177–245) individuals in 2010. The variability in abundance
   estimates is likely to be a reflection of how individuals used the study
   area, rather than fluctuations in true population size. The best fitting
   capture–recapture model suggested a random temporary emigration pattern
   and, when coupled with relatively high temporary emigration rates (0.33
   (s.e. 0.07) – 0.66 (s.e. 0.05)) indicated that the study area did not
   cover the entire ranges of the photo-identified dolphins. Apparent
   survival rate is a product of true survival and permanent emigration and
   was estimated annually at 0.95 (s.e. 0.02). Since permanent emigration
   from the study area is unlikely, true survival was estimated to be close
   to 0.95. This study provides a robust baseline for future comparisons of
   dolphin demographics, which may be of importance should climate change or

   Thermal transition temperature (T max) of ASC and PSC were 34.23 and

   dentitions offers a better understanding of the shark's systematic
   position and tooth function. Cretoxyrhina mantelli has a lamnoid
   dentition with closely spaced tooth rows without any overlap, and with a
   tendency toward monognathic heterodonty. The best specimen shows four
   symphysial, two anterior, three intermediate, five lateral, and at least
   seven posterior teeth in the upper dental series, and one? symphysial,
   three anterior, five lateral, and at least ten posterior teeth in the
   lower. Some variation in individual tooth morphology is noted. Dental
   features support current taxonomic assignments of C. mantelli at ordinal,
   familial, and generic levels. Cretoxyrhina mantelli probably stabbed and
   anchored its food with large anterior teeth, and cut food primarily with

AB Summary In the shark Scyliorhinus stellaris we have biochemically
   identified and cDNA-cloned orthologs of human vimentin and desmin, SstV
   and SstD, as deduced from immunoblotting and sequence alignment with
   teleost, frog and human vimentin and desmin, respectively. This allowed
   us to further clarify the relationship of previously identified lower
   vertebrate intermediate filament proteins to mammalian vimentin and
   desmin. Immunofluorescence microscopy with antibodies H5 and VIM13.2
   showed vimentin expression in shark eye and brain and absence in
   epithelia, which resembles the situation in higher vertebrates. In
   addition, SstV is expressed in many mesenchymal cell types which
   corresponds to the case in terrestrial vertebrates but strongly differs
   from teleosts. Surprisingly, shark interstitial cells, including
   fibroblasts, express neither SstV nor keratins but other as yet
   unidentified intermediate filament proteins as deduced from their
   reactivity with antibody IFA. In vitro assembly studies of recombinant
   SstV revealed a temperature optimum for uncompromised filament assembly
   of 15 °C. At 18 °C, but more pronounced at 21 °C and 24 °C, which is
   notably above the animal's inherent preferred environmental temperature,
   both, SstV and SstD assemble into thick and inflexible fibers. Thus,

   que les taux instantanes d'accroissement de la population variait de
   0,068 a 0,283. La composition par âge stable prevue, l'esperance moyenne
   de vivre plus longtemps et la valeur de reproduction pour des femelles
   des deux populations etaient semblables. Les tables de survie que nous
   avons elaborees indiquaient un accroissement de population legerement
   plus eleve dans la baie Florida; neanmoins, cette difference est le
   resultat, estimons-nous, des methodes utilisees pour evaluer la
   mortalite. Les facteurs environnementaux ou l'heritabilite peuvent
   expliquer les differences d'evolution biologique chez ces deux
   populations. En somme, les taux instantanes d'accroissement de la

   arterial blood measurements. ArterialPo2 ranged from 7 to 80 Torr, while
   arterial oxygen content (Cao2) varied from 1.6 vol% to 6.8 vol% among ten
   experimental animals. A significant increase in arterialPo2, oxygen
   content, and hematocrit was noted during increased activity. Since the
   venous system provides little or no oxygen reserve, increased oxygen
   extraction from the blood (\(Ca_{O_{_2 } } - C\bar v_{O_2 } \)) appears
   to be met by an increase inCao2 rather than a decrease in\(C\bar v_{O_2 }
   \). Mechanisms to accomplish this may include increasing hematocrit and
   vacular gill shunts.

   transepithelial resistance was 36.3 +/- 2.3 omega X cm2 (means +/- SE, n
   = 44). Other electrophysiological variables varied widely under control
   conditions. In unstimulated tubules (n = 16) the transepithelial voltage
   (VT,o) was lumen positive (1.2 +/- 0.2 mV), the basolateral membrane
   potential (Vbl,x) was -61.3 +/- 1.6 mV, and the fractional resistance of
   the apical membrane (fRa) was 0.67 +/- 0.02. Spontaneously stimulated
   tubules (n = 28) had lumen-negative VT,o values (-1.5 +/- 0.4 mV), low
   Vbl,x values (-41.3 +/- 1.7 mV), and low fRa values (0.30 +/- 0.02). The
   stimulated state can be induced in unstimulated tubules via treatment
   with cAMP. Multiple microelectrode impalements in a single tubule
   revealed epithelial cells sharing similar electrophysiological
   properties. Selective ion substitutions in the tubule lumen and
   peritubular bath uncovered an increased Cl conductance in the apical
   membrane of spontaneously and cAMP-stimulated tubules.
   Anthracene-9-carboxylic acid tended to reverse the stimulated state, and
   furosemide hyperpolarized Vbl,x. These results constitute the first

AB Pacific sleeper sharks Somniosus pacificus were captured near Steller sea
   lion Eumetopias jubatus rookeries during the period when Steller sea lion
   pups are most vulnerable to Pacific sleeper shark predation (first water
   entrance and weaning). Analysis of stomach contents revealed that
   teleosts were the dominant prey in August and cephalopods were the
   dominant prey in May (n = 198). Marine mammals were found in 15% of
   stomachs regardless of season, but no Steller sea lion tissues were
   detected. Molecular genetic analysis identified grey whale Eschrichtius
   robustus and harbour seal Phoca vitulina remains in some Pacific sleeper
   shark stomachs. Most mammals were cetacean and at least 70% of the
   cetaceans were probably scavenged. Although Pacific sleeper shark and
   Steller sea lion ranges overlapped, so predation could potentially occur,
   the diet study suggested that predation on Steller sea lions is unlikely,
   at least when pups first enter the water or during weaning. Harbour seals
   were infrequent prey and may have been consumed alive. Pacific sleeper
   sharks consume fast-swimming prey like Pacific salmon Oncorhynchus sp.,
   most likely live animals rather than scavenged animals. Pacific sleeper
   sharks appeared to be opportunistic consumers of the available prey and
   carrion, feeding both on the bottom and in the water column, and their
   diet shifted to teleosts and cetacean carrion as the fish grew larger.

AB The gummy shark (Mustelus antarcticus) is a major target species in two
   substantial shark fisheries that operate in temperate Australian waters.
   Data on the reproductive biology of M. antarcticus in the waters off
   south-western Australia were obtained from samples collected by
   commercial vessels operating from Albany to Esperance, Western Australia.
   The samples contained a ratio of four females to one male. M. antarcticus
   is a viviparous, aplacental species. Males mature at a smaller size than
   females. Since the overwhelming majority of sharks sampled were mature,
   it was not possible to estimate precisely the mean size at which sexual
   maturity was attained. Examination of seasonal changes in the development
   of ova and testes, in uterine contents, and in embryo growth established
   that the period of parturition, mating and ovulation occurred over the 3
   months between early November and early February. The gestation period
   was 11-12 months. Full-term embryos ranged in size from 30 to 36 cm total
   length and occurred in a sex ratio of one male to one female. The ovarian
   and gestational cycles proceed concurrently, with reproduction occurring
   annually. Only one of the 224 females analysed for uterine content was
   considered to be in a true post-partum condition. The number of embryos
   (N) per mother increased with the length of the mother (L) according to
   the regression N = exp(-4.13398 + 0.049171L). The reproductive biology of
   females collected off Albany and Esperance differed in some respects from
   that of females collected off south-eastern Australia.

AB Detecting and determining the validity of local extinctions is an
   important conservation measure in order to uncover management failures.
   There are quantitative and qualitative methods that estimate extinction
   probability based on past sighting records. However, because current
   baselines about species’ abundances and distributions in the sea were
   mostly established after humans had started affecting marine populations,
   researchers must often rely on historical data to elucidate past
   environmental conditions. We review early historical records from the
   Archipelago of Saint Paul’s Rocks, together with data from recent
   expeditions, with the aim of testing the hypothesis that reef sharks
   (Carcharhinus spp.) have become extinct there. Our analyses are based on
   non-parametric probabilistic tests for extinction and on a qualitative
   framework to examine and judge as objectively as possible the likelihood
   of local extinction. Until the mid-20th century, visitors to St. Paul’s
   Rocks invariably commented on the remarkable number of sharks around the
   Archipelago. These observations contrast with those of expeditions
   carried out during the last decade, which report no carcharhinid reef
   sharks while scuba diving in the archipelago, despite many more hours of
   underwater fieldwork than previous expeditions. All quantitative and
   qualitative methods conclude that the reef shark Carcharhinus
   galapagensis is locally extinct at St. Paul’s Rocks after a sharp
   decrease in abundance that took place following the commencement of
   fishing. However, the persistence of occasional individuals of the once
   locally common Carcharhinus falciformis in the vicinity of the
   Archipelago, as a result of constant immigration of this oceanic species
   from outside the area, suggest that the population might recover if the
   present fishing pressure was removed.

AB Interest in animal personalities has generated a burgeoning literature on
   repeatability in individual traits such as boldness or exploration
   through time or across different contexts. Yet, repeatability can be
   influenced by the interactive social strategies of individuals, for
   example, consistent inter-individual variation in aggression is well
   documented. Previous work has largely focused on the social aspects of
   repeatability in animal behaviour by testing individuals in dyadic
   pairings. Under natural conditions, individuals interact in a
   heterogeneous polyadic network. However, the extent to which there is
   repeatability of social traits at this higher order network level remains
   unknown. Here, we provide the first empirical evidence of consistent and
   repeatable animal social networks. Using a model species of shark, a
   taxonomic group in which repeatability in behaviour has yet to be
   described, we repeatedly quantified the social networks of ten
   independent shark groups across different habitats, testing repeatability
   in individual network position under changing environments. To understand
   better the mechanisms behind repeatable social behaviour, we also
   explored the coupling between individual preferences for specific group
   sizes and social network position. We quantify repeatability in sharks by
   demonstrating that despite changes in aggregation measured at the group
   level, the social network position of individuals is consistent across
   treatments. Group size preferences were found to influence the social
   network position of individuals in small groups but less so for larger
   groups suggesting network structure, and thus, repeatability was driven
   by social preference over aggregation tendency.

AB The longevity and low fecundity of sharks make them particularly
   vulnerable to over-exploitation. Previous studies have emphasized the
   range of natural productivities observed across elasmobranch species and
   have used this to explain the sustainability of some elasmobranch
   fisheries and the deple - tion of others. This paper discusses the
   assessment of the two principal species fished by the Southern Shark
   Fishery of Australia, school shark (Galeorhinus galeus) and gummy shark
   (Mustelus antarcticus). The modeled simulations presented here show that
   shark behaviour patterns and fishing techniques which restrict fishing
   mortality to a few juvenile age-classes may be equally or more important
   than the productivity of different species in determining their relative
   robustness under exploitation. Counter- intuitively concentrating a
   fishery on a few year-classes of pups, juveniles or sub-adults proves to
   be a robust management strategy for elasmobranch fisheries, as long as
   the means exist for protecting adults from fishing mortality. Furthermore
   this management strategy proves to be most effective with the species
   considered to be least productive, those with greatest longevity. The
   obverse of this finding is to highlight the damaging impact on
   elasmobranch fisheries of human activities such as by-catch, finning,
   sport fishing and beach protection that cause even low levels of adult
   mortality .

AB Transverse sections of the skin in the dorsal fin of the white shark,
   Carcharodon carcharias, tiger shark, Galeocerdo cuvier, and spotted
   raggedtooth shark, Carcharias taurus, show large numbers of dermal fiber
   bundles, which extend from the body into the fin. The bundles are tightly
   grouped together in staggered forma- tion (not arranged in a straight
   line or in rows). This arrangement of dermal fibers gives tensile
   strength with- out impeding fiber movement. Tangential sections indi-
   cate that the fibers in all three species are strained and lie at angles
   in excess of 60°. Of the three species investigated the dermal fibers in
   C. carcharias are the most densely concentrated and extend furthest
   distally along the dorsal fin. The overall results indicate that the
   dorsal fin of C. carcharias functions as a dynamic stabilizer and that
   the dermal fibers are crucial to this role. The fibers work like riggings
   that stabilize a ship's mast. During fast swim- ming, when the problems
   of yaw and roll are greatest, hydrostatic pressure within the shark
   increases and the fibers around the body, including in the dorsal fin,
   become taut, thereby stiffening the fin. During slow swimming and feeding
   the hydrostatic pressure is reduced, the fibers are slackened, and the
   muscles are able to exert greater bending forces on the fin via the
   radials and ceratotrichia. In C. carcharias there is a trade-off for
   greater stiffness of the dorsal fin against flexibility. J. Morphol.

   numbers of recaptures were still being made up to 15 years after release.
   There was no mixing of snapper populations between the two inner gulfs
   nor was there any movement between the ocean and the inner bay. This
   supports genetic and other evidence for the existence of several separate
   stocks in the region. Snapper of the ocean stock were mostly recaptured
   within 20 km of their release point, although a few fish moved long
   distances of up to 370 km southwards along the continental shelf. The
   tagged snapper tended to become more dispersed along the shelf with
   increasing years at liberty. Yet, an empirical model indicated that of
   the snapper recruiting to the main oceanic fishing grounds near Koks
   Island, which have a mean life expectancy in the fishery of 1.5 years,
   76% would remain within 93 km (50 nautical miles), even after 6 years.
   The distinct stocks and their movement characteristics are significant
   for snapper fishery management in the Shark Bay region.

AB : The oxygen consumption of an active tropical elasmobranch, the lemon
   shark (Negaprion brevirostris), was measured at different swimming speeds
   in an annular respirometer. The resulting power-performance curve had a
   slope of 0.36 which is similar to that of moderately active teleosts. The
   standard metabolic rate of this elasmobranch (95 ml O2.kg-1.h-1 was
   higher than that of other sharks, whereas the routine metabolic rate (110
   ml O2.kg-1.h-1) was less than that of other elasmobranchs previously
   studied. Active metabolic rate (226 ml O2.kg-1.h-1), measured in one
   individual, was the highest for any elasmobranch measured to date. The
   cost of living of the tropical water lemon shark was calculated to be
   approximately 2.5 times greater than that of a temperate water shark, but
   not as high as a salmonid. It is possible that previous generalizations
   on the poor aerobic performance of sharks are based on data from the less
   active, temperate water sharks, and are misleading since the metabolic
   rate of this more active species compares well with active teleosts.

   salmon sharks (Lamna ditropis) caught at 0–7 m depth at night by research
   drift gillnets in the transition region of the western North Pacific
   during April–May of 1999 and 2000. Blue sharks of 50–175 cm total length
   fed on a large variety of prey species, consisting of 24 species of
   cephalopods and 16 species of fishes. Salmon sharks of 69–157 cm total
   length fed on a few prey species, consisting of 10 species of cephalopods
   and one species of fish. Important prey for the blue sharks were large,
   non-active, gelatinous, meso- to bathypelagic cephalopods (e.g.,
   Chiroteuthis calyx, Haliphron atlanticus, Histioteuthis dofleini and
   Belonella borealis) and small myctophid fishes. Important prey for the
   salmon sharks were mid-sized, active, muscular, epi- to mesopelagic
   squids (e.g. Gonatopsis borealis, Onychoteuthis borealijaponica and
   Berryteuthis anonychus). Our results suggest that blue sharks feed on
   cephalopods mainly during the daytime when they descend to deep water.
   Salmon sharks may feed opportunistically with no apparent diurnal feeding
   period. Blue sharks and salmon sharks have sympatric distribution in the
   transition region in spring; they have different feeding habits and
   strategies that reduce competition for food resources.

TI Growth dynamics of the spinner shark (Carcharhinus brevipinna) off the

   methods
PY 2005
AB The age and growth dynamics of the spinner shark (Carcharhinus
   brevipinna) in the northwest Atlantic Ocean off the southeast United
   States and in the Gulf of Mexico were examined and four growth models
   were used to examine variation in the ability to fit size-at-age data.
   The von Bertalanffy growth model, an alternative equation of the von
   Bertalanffy growth model with a size-at-birth intercept, the Gompertz
   growth model, and a logistic model were fitted to sex-specific observed
   size-at-age data. Considering the statistical criteria (e.g., lowest mean
   square error [MSE], high coefficient-of-determination, and greatest level
   of significance) we desired for this study, the logistic model provided
   the best overall fit to the size-at-age data, whereas the von Bertalanffy
   growth model gave the worst. For “biological validity,” the von
   Bertalanffy model for female sharks provided estimates similar to those
   reported in other studies. However, the von Bertalanffy model was deemed
   inappropriate for describing the growth of male spinner sharks because
   estimates of theoretical maximum size (L∞) indicated a size much larger
   than that observed in the field. However, the growth coefficient (k=
   0.14/yr) from the Gompertz model provided an estimate most similar to
   that reported for other large coastal species. The analysis of growth for
   spinner shark in the present study demonstrates the importance of fitting
   alternative models when standard models fit the data poorly or when
   growth estimates do not appear to be realistic.

AB This study describes the diet of the sandbar shark, Carcharhinus
   plumbeus, highlighting differences in diet within various regions of the
   Virginia (USA) nursery area, as well as ontogenetic changes in diet.
   Stomach samples were obtained in 2001 and 2002 from 232 sharks caught by
   gillnets or longlines. Historical data from the Virginia Institute of
   Marine Science (VIMS) Shark Ecology Program were also analyzed.
   Ontogenetic changes in diet were evident, with crustacean prey decreasing
   in frequency with increasing shark size, and elasmobranch prey importance
   increasing with increasing shark size. Whereas previous research in
   Chincoteague Bay, VA showed the blue crab, Callinectes sapidus, was the
   dominant crustacean in sandbar shark diet, the mantis shrimp, Squilla
   empusa, dominated the crustacean portion of the diet in this study.
   Differences in diet of sharks were observed among locations within the
   study area. Small juveniles (≤80 cm precaudal length) in the lower
   Chesapeake Bay ate more fishes, whereas Eastern Shore juveniles ate more
   crustaceans. Crustacean prey items varied among locations along the
   Eastern Shore, with more portunid crabs consumed in waters near
   Wachapreague and more mantis shrimp consumed near Sand Shoal Inlet. Our
   study showed that Carcharhinus plumbeus is a generalist predator and is
   thus unlikely to strongly impact the population of any particular prey
   species, and in turn is not likely to be strongly affected by
   fluctuations in abundance of a single prey species.

   to 40. Whereas the number of C. leucas counted at the feeding site
   increased over the years, shark numbers decreased over the course of a

AB Ten years have passed since the last synopsis of whale shark Rhincodon
   typus biogeography. While a recent review of the species' biology and
   ecology summarized the vast data collected since then, it is clear that
   information on population geographic connectivity, migration and
   demography of R. typus is still limited and scattered. Understanding R.
   typus migratory behaviour is central to its conservation management
   considering the genetic evidence suggesting local aggregations are
   connected at the generational scale over entire ocean basins. By
   collating available data on sightings, tracked movements and distribution
   information, this review provides evidence for the hypothesis of
   broad-scale connectivity among populations, and generates a model
   describing how the world's R. typus are part of a single, global
   meta-population. Rhincodon typus occurrence timings and distribution
   patterns make possible a connection between several aggregation sites in
   the Indian Ocean. The present conceptual model and validating data lend
   support to the hypothesis that R. typus are able to move among the three
   largest ocean basins with a minimum total travelling time of around 2–4
   years. The model provides a worldwide perspective of possible R. typus
   migration routes, and suggests a modified focus for additional research
   to test its predictions. The framework can be used to trim the hypotheses
   for R. typus movements and aggregation timings, thereby isolating
   possible mating and breeding areas that are currently unknown. This will
   assist endeavours to predict the longer-term response of the species to
   ocean warming and changing patterns of human-induced mortality.

   shark (Triaenodon obesus) movements and biology. This study used
   photo-identification from community-contributed photographs to reveal
   patterns in movements, reproductive biology, and fisheries interactions
   in this species that have not been previously revealed through more
   traditional methods. At least 178 individual sharks were identified, and
   26 movements were observed. These included movement distances of up to
   26.4 km, movement rates of up to 3.27 km/day (9.8 km in 3 days), and
   movements that required the transit of a 140 m deep channel. Other
   animals showed high philopatry, being re-sighted at the same locality on
   multiple occasions (up to 13 sightings for one individual) over periods
   of up to 7 years. Females showed higher philopatry than males and were
   more likely than males to be found at shallow (<10 m depth) localities
   throughout the year. The proportion of male sightings at shallow
   localities was significantly higher in April and May than other months of
   the year, possibly due to males coming into the shallows to mate with
   females. A peak in sightings of late-term females followed by an abrupt
   decline suggests that pupping season is May into early June, and two
   females were observed pregnant in consecutive years despite evidence that
   the gestation period is approximately 1 year for this species. Nine
   percent of animals carried fishing tackle or exhibited jaw injuries
   associated with fishery interactions, with multiple individuals found
   dead after being hooked by fishers.

AB The common blacktip shark (Carcharhinus limbatus) and the Australian
   blacktip shark (C. tilstoni) are morphologically similar species that
   co-occur in subtropical and tropical Australia. In striking contrast to
   what has been previously reported, we demonstrate that the common
   blacktip shark is not rare in northern Australia but occurs in
   approximately equal frequencies with the Australian blacktip shark.
   Management of shark resources in northern Australia needs to take account
   of this new information. Species identification was performed using
   nucleotide sequences of the control, NADH dehydrogenase subunit 4 (ND4)
   and cytochrome oxidase I (COI) regions in the mitochondrial genome. The
   proportion of overall genetic variation (FST) between the two species was
   small (0.042, P < 0.01) based on allele frequencies at five
   microsatellite loci. We confirm that a third blacktip species (C.
   amblyrhynchoides, graceful shark) is closely related to C. tilstoni and
   C. limbatus and can be distinguished from them on the basis of mtDNA
   sequences from two gene regions. The Australian blacktip shark (C.
   tilstoni) was not encountered among 20 samples from central Indonesia
   that were later confirmed to be common blacktip and graceful sharks.
   Fisheries regulators urgently need new information on life history,
   population structure and morphological characters for species
   identification of blacktip shark species in Australia.

TI Nursery Areas as Essential Shark Habitats: A Theoretical Perspective
PY 2007
AB Nursery areas are widely considered to be essential habitats for sharks.
   While there have been many efforts to determine the locations of
   nurseries in coastal waters and studies of movements within these
   nurseries, few studies have attempted to identify the factors that
   influence nursery area selection and habitat use within nurseries. Such
   data are critical for identifying essential habitats within nurseries and
   determining the factors that might set the carrying capacity of these
   areas. Behavioral and ecological theory provides important insights into
   nursery area use and the definition of essential habitats. For example,
   simply measuring the density of animals in various habitats can lead to
   (1) incorrect identification of critical areas because animal density and
   habitat quality (or importance) do not always coincide, and (2) incorrect
   assumptions about the factors limiting popu- lation sizes. Food abundance
   and predation risk are likely important determinants of nursery area
   selection, habitat use within nurseries, and carrying capacity of
   nurseries. Currently, we know little about how these factors and the
   physical features of the environment (e.g., water temperature, habitat
   structure) influence juvenile sharks. Here, I review our current
   understanding of shark nurseries in a theoretical context to identify
   areas where future studies are required and generate testable hypoth-
   eses regarding the use of nursery habitats.

AB The sevengill shark Nolorynchus cepedianus is one of the most common
   species of large shark in the temperate coastal waters of southern
   Africa. Despite its abundance, very little is known of its biology along
   the southern African coast. Maturation in male sevengills begins at about
   140 cm total length (TL), and is indicated by coiling of the epididymis.
   Most males mature at approximately 160 cm TL. Male sevengills have viable
   sperm throughout the year and seem capable of reproducing year-round.
   Females have a complex and prolonged maturation period and mature at a

AB A study of growth, mortality and yield per recruit of G. australis in
   south-eastern Australia has been undertaken. The species is long-lived,
   slow growing and has a low natural mortality rate. The fishery in
   Victoria was recently adversely affected by the imposition in 1972 of an
   upper size limit of 104 cm, in addition to an existing legal minimum
   length of 91 cm, to ensure that sharks with flesh mercury levels in
   excess of 0.5 µg/g were not taken for human consumption. More recent
   (1976) legislation altered these limits to a minimum length of 71 cm and
   a maximum length of 112 cm. This paper discusses the possible effects of
   increased exploitation within the length limitations which are currently
   operative on the availability of breeding stock of the school shark.

AB The complete mitochondrial genome of the grey bamboo shark, Chiloscyllium
   griseum (Orectolobiformes: Hemiscylliidae) was obtained, with a total of
   16 755 base pairs (bp). The mitogenome encoded 13 protein-coding genes,
   two ribosomal RNAs, 22 transfer RNAs and a noncoding control region, a
   gene arrangement identical to the most common type found in vertebrates.
   All tRNA sequences were folded into typical cloverleaf secondary
   structure with the exception of tRNA-Ser2, in which the DHU arm stem was
   replaced with 12 unpaired nucleotides and formed a simple loop. In the
   control region, the putative termination-associated sequences (TAS) with
   hairpin-loop structure and the conserved sequence blocks (CSB) I-III were
   identified and considered to be associated with the replication and
   transcription of mtDNA. No repeat motifs were found in the mitogenome of
   C. griseum. On the basis of the mitogenomic data available in the Class
   Chondrichthyes from both Genbank and this study, and the phylogenetic
   analyses using maximum likelihood (ML) and Bayesian inference (BI)
   methods, the results strongly support the basal division between batoids
   and sharks and the monophyly of the Superorder Galeomorphii, and confirm
   the phylogenetic position of C. griseum in the Subclass Elasmobranchii.
   This study suggests that the mitogenomic data are more robust for
   reconstructing phylogenetic relationships than individual genes in the
   Elasmobranchii.

   (1) changes in hormonal levels during maturation, (2) concentrations of
   circulating steroid hormones during peak breeding season, and (3)
   hormonal levels during gestation, including the collection of serial

   functions were constructed for populations in northwest Florida and Tampa
   Bay, Florida. Von Bertalanffy growth function parameters for males in
   northwest Florida (L, = 963.1 mm FL, K = 0.59, to = -0.754 yr) were
   significantly different from those in Tampa Bay (L, = 801.0 mm FL, K =
   0.771, to = -0.797 yr), as were those for females (L, = 1136.5 mm FL, K =
   0.352, to = -1.212 yr in northwest Florida; L, = 1241.3 mm FL, K = 0.237,
   to = -1.536 yr in Tampa Bay). Theoretical longevity, estimated as the age
   at which 95% of L, is reached, varied from age 10-16 yr for females and
   4.5-9.0 yr for males, depending on geographic area. The oldest sharks
   aged were 4.5+ yr. Centrum edge and marginal increment analyses lent
   support to the hypothesis that narrow dark bands are formed during winter
   months. Length-frequency analysis verified back-calculated size at ages
   0, 1, and 2. The growth dynamics of blacknose sharks are similar to those
   of other relatively small, fast-growing, short-lived species of sharks.

AB Illegal shark fishing is thought to occur globally, including within
   so-called “shark sanctuaries”, marine reserves and even inside UNESCO
   World Heritage sites, such as the Galapagos Islands. Presumably, this is
   due to poor local enforcement coupled with the growing international
   demand (and high economic incentives) for shark and other wildlife
   products. Understanding illegal shark fishing practices, and specifically
   catch composition, is important as poaching is identified as a causal
   factor of global declines in shark populations. Unfortunately, reliable
   quantitative data on illegal shark fishing are scarce. Here, the catch
   onboard an illegal shark fishing vessel seized within the borders of the
   Galapagos Marine Reserve was documented. A total of 379 sharks from seven
   shark species were found onboard the vessel. A large fraction of the
   illegal catch was comprised of both female and juvenile sharks (64% and
   89%, respectively). Despite numerous recent advances in shark
   conservation worldwide, this study demonstrates illegal shark fishing is
   an ongoing concern and that stricter enforcement and legislation is
   urgently needed, particularly in areas of high biodiversity.

AB Abstract Deania calceus ( Lowe, 1839 ), the bird-beak dogfish, is a
   dominant species in trawl and longline catches in the Rockall Trough and
   the slopes of the Porcupine Bank, west and north of Ireland. It is
   discarded because the carcass is currently of no commercial value. The
   distribution and biology of this species was investigated from trawl and
   longline surveys (1996–1999) of the continental slope off Ireland from
   49°N to 58°N. The highest catch rates were in the depth range 500–900 m
   on the southern slopes of the Rockall Trough and western slopes of the
   Porcupine Bank. Males outnumbered females in all but the greatest depths.
   The length range was 56–117 cm for females and 55–109 cm for males. First
   and second dorsal spines were used for age estimation and each produced
   similar results. Age estimates, whilst not validated, ranged from 11 to
   35 years for females and from 13 to 29 years for males. Comparisons with
   a published study in Portuguese waters show that smaller and younger
   specimens not present in the study area were present off Portugal. The
   results of this study and from the Portuguese study were used to
   construct von Bertalanffy growth curves for males and females. Mean ripe
   oocyte number was 13 (range: 6–14). Very few gravid females were recorded
   and most females were immature. Length at 50% maturity was 85 cm for
   males and 106 cm for females.

AB Ig and T cell receptor (TCR) genes consist of separate genomic elements,
   which must undergo rearrangement and joining before a functional protein
   can be expressed. Considerable plasticity in the genomic arrangement of
   these elements has occurred during the evolution of the immune system. In
   tetrapods, all Ig and TCR chain elements are arranged as translocons. In
   teleosts, the Ig heavy and TCR chains are translocons, but light chain
   genes may occur as clusters. However, in chondrichthyes, all of the Ig
   light and heavy chain genes are arranged as clusters. These clusters vary
   in number from <10 to several hundred, depending on isotype and species.
   Here, we report that the germ-line gene for the TCR γ chain in a
   chondrichthyan, the sandbar shark (Carcharhinus plumbeus), is present as
   a single locus arranged in a classic translocon pattern. Thus, the shark
   utilizes 2 types of genomic arrangements, the unique cluster organization
   for Ig genes and the “conventional” translocon organization for TCR
   genes. The TCR γ translocon contains at least 5 V region genes, 3 J
   segment genes, and 1 C segment. As expected, the third hypervariable
   segment (CDR3), formed by the rearrangement of the Vγ and Jγ segments,
   contributed the major variability in the intact V region structure. Our
   data also suggest that diversity may be generated by mutation in the V
   regions.

AB Catches of sharks and bycatch in large-mesh nets and baited drumlines
   used by the Queensland Shark Control Program were examined to determine
   the efficacy of both gear types and assess fishing strategies that
   minimise their impacts. There were few significant differences in the
   size of both sharks and bycatch in the two gear types, apart from
   significantly smaller (p < 0.05) tiger sharks Galeocerdo cuvier being
   taken on drumlines and smaller green turtles Chelonia mydas in nets.
   Catch per unit effort showed orders of magnitude differences among
   species, even within the same family. Hammerhead sharks and rays were
   particularly vulnerable to net capture, whereas higher catch rates of
   tiger sharks were observed for drumlines. Nets caught more marine
   mammals, teleost fish and rays, whereas drumlines exhibited higher catch
   rates of the threatened loggerhead turtle Caretta caretta. Survival of
   most taxa (particularly obligate ram ventilators) was lower in nets than
   drumlines. Bycatch species (turtles and marine mammals) were able to swim
   to the surface to breathe when they were hooked on drumlines, enhancing
   their survival potential. Fishing strategies that recognise the different
   selectivity patterns of the gear can be developed to suit local biotic
   and abiotic conditions, although it is recognised that quantification of
   both ecological risk and risk to bathers is not a simple task.

   juveniles were found in offshore continental shelf waters rather than in
   shallow waters of estuaries and marine embayments. Results indicated a
   biennial reproductive periodicity. Mating occurred during summer and
   autumn, and parturition took place after a 12-month gestation. Pups were
   born at 40 to 45 cm FL throughout most of the species’ Western Australian
   range. The majority of neonates were caught at temperate latitudes.
   Litter sizes varied between 4 and 10, with a mean of 6.5. There was a

   species were dominated by the higher chlorinated congeners
   (hexachlorobiphenyls: 62.8–63.9%, penta-: 15.2–21.3%, hepta-: 13.4–14.5%)
   with most of the lower chlorinated congeners being absent or present at
   very low levels. In both species, the total 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenz- p
   -dioxin toxic equivalent (TEQs) concentrations (blue shark: 2.51 pg/g;
   kitefin shark: 1.46 pg/g) seem to be relatively modest. Regards to DDT
   component pattern, p , p ′-DDE was dominant in the liver of both species
   (blue shark: 81.5%; kitefin shark: 38.0%), while the percentage
   composition of the other metabolites was differently characterized. The
   composition pattern of DDTs and the low value of p , p ′-DDE/DDTs ratio
   in the specimens from Ionian Sea suggest that organochlorine pesticide
   contamination is still continuing in this marine environment.

AB A study has been made of catecholamine stores that may be involved in
   cardiac regulation in the shark Heterodontus portusjacksoni. The anatomy
   of the anterior chromaffin bodies associated with the sympathetic chain
   is described. A fluoresent histochemical study shows that the chromaffin
   cells contain a monoamine, probably noradrenaline. The chromaffin cells
   have a fine structure comparable to that of chromaffin cells in other
   vertebrates. The heart is devoid of histochemically-demonstrable
   chromaffin cells or adrenergic nerve fibres, with the exception of a very
   sparse adrenergic innervation of the sinus venosus. It is argued that

   Appendices of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species
   (CITES; porbeagle, Lamna nasus, oceanic whitetip, Carcharhinus longimanus
   scalloped hammerhead, Sphyrna lewini, smooth hammerhead, S. zygaena and
   great hammerhead S. mokarran) in addition to three species listed in the
   early part of this century (whale, Rhincodon typus, basking, Cetorhinus
   maximus, and white, Carcharodon carcharias). Shark fins are traded
   internationally to supply the Asian dried seafood market, in which they
   are used to make the luxury dish shark fin soup. Shark fins usually enter
   international trade with their skin still intact and can be identified
   using morphological characters or standard DNA-barcoding approaches. Once
   they reach Asia and are traded in this region the skin is removed and
   they are treated with chemicals that eliminate many key diagnostic
   characters and degrade their DNA (“processed fins”). Here, we present a
   validated mini-barcode assay based on partial sequences of the cytochrome
   oxidase I gene that can reliably identify the processed fins of seven of
   the eight CITES listed shark species. We also demonstrate that the assay
   can even frequently identify the species or genus of origin of shark fin
   soup (31 out of 50 samples).

   from 1992 to 1999. Vertebra centra were picked from 145 males and 153
   females for age determination. The number of annual rings observed for
   males and females was 0–8 and 0–13, respectively. Combined sex von
   Bertalanffy growth equations were obtained as follows: Lt = 216.4(1 −
   e−0.148(t+1.76)) where Lt is precaudal length in cm at age t. A mature
   size for males was considered to be approximately 135–140 cm (precaudal
   length), with an estimated age of 5–6 years, whereas corresponding values
   for females were 145–150 cm and 6–7 years, respectively. Birth size
   ranged from 48 to 60 cm. There was no remarkable difference in growth,
   birth size and age at maturity between the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans.
   The life history parameters of the silky shark are approximately the same

   error-prone RNA dependent RNA polymerase from Qβ bacteriophage, to create
   a diverse library of single domain antibody fragments based on the shark
   IgNAR antibody isotype. Coupling of these randomly mutated mRNA templates
   directly to the translating ribosome allowed in vitro selection of
   affinity matured variants showing enhanced binding to target, the apical
   membrane antigen 1 (AMA1) from Plasmodium falciparum . One mutation
   mapping to the IgNAR CDR1 loop was not readily additive to other changes,
   a result explained by structural analysis of aromatic interactions
   linking the CDR1, CDR3, and Ig framework regions. This combination
   appeared also to be counter-selected in experiments, suggesting that in
   vitro affinity maturation is additionally capable of discriminating
   against incorrectly produced protein variants. Interestingly, a further
   mutation was directed to a position in the IgNAR heavy loop 4 which is
   also specifically targeted during the in vivo shark response to antigen,
   providing a correlation between natural processes and laboratory-based
   affinity maturation systems.

AB In order to investigate the metabolic poise of the elasmobranch rectal
   gland, we conducted two lines of experimentation. First, we examined the
   effects of feeding on plasma metabolites and enzyme activities from
   several metabolic pathways in several tissues of the dogfish shark,
   Squalus acanthias, after starvation and at 6, 20, 30 and 48 h
   post-feeding. We found a rapid and sustained ten-fold decrease in plasma
   β-hydroxybutyrate at 6 h and beyond compared with starved dogfish,
   suggesting an upregulation in the use of this substrate, a decrease in
   production, or both. Plasma acetoacetate levels remain unchanged, whereas
   there was a slight and transient decrease in plasma glucose levels at 6
   h. Several enzymes showed a large increase in activity post-feeding,
   including β-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase in rectal gland and liver, and
   in rectal gland, isocitrate dehydrogenase, citrate synthase, lactate
   dehydrogenase, aspartate amino transferase, alanine amino transferase,
   glutamine synthetase and Na+/K+ ATPase. Also notable in these enzyme
   measurements was the overall high level of activity in the rectal gland
   in general. For example, activity of the Krebs' TCA cycle enzyme citrate
   synthase (over 30 U g-1) was similar to activities in muscle from other
   species of highly active fish. Surprisingly, lactate dehydrogenase
   activity in the gland was also high (over 150 U g-1), suggesting either
   an ability to produce lactate anaerobically or use lactate as an aerobic
   fuel. Given these interesting observations, in the second aspect of the
   study we examined the ability of several metabolic substrates (alone and
   in combination) to support chloride secretion by the rectal gland. Among
   the substrates tested at physiological concentrations (glucose,
   β-hydroxybutyrate, lactate, alanine, acetoacetate, and glutamate), only
   glucose could consistently maintain a viable preparation. Whereas
   β-hydroxybutyrate could enhance gland activity when presented in
   combination with glucose, surprisingly it could not sustain chloride
   secretion when used as a lone substrate. Our results are discussed in the
   context of the in vivo role of the gland and mechanisms of possible
   upregulation of enzyme activities.

   commercial fisheries that operate in deepwater off southeastern
   Australia. Bands on the second dorsal spine were used to obtain age
   estimates. The number of bands on the external surface of the spine and
   within the inner dentine layer increased with animal length. Most spines
   had more bands on the external surface, and the rate of band formation
   was significantly different between the external surface and the inner
   dentine layer. Females had a maximum of 57 external bands and 26 internal
   bands, while males had up to 48 external bands and 22 internal bands. Age
   estimates from external bands suggest maturity (A 50) at 20 years for
   males and 30 years for females. Internal band age estimates suggest
   maturity at 10.5 years for males and 11.5 years for females. Although
   there is a large discrepancy between these two preliminary (i.e.,
   unvalidated) age estimates, they both suggest that E. baxteri is a
   long-lived and late maturing species that is likely to be susceptible to
   over fishing.

AB Abstract During ontogeny, the yolk sac of viviparous sharks
   differentiates into a yolk sac placenta which functions in gas exchange
   and hematrophic nutrient transport. The pre-implantation yolk sac
   functions in respiration and yolk absorption. In a 10.0 cm embryo, the
   yolk sac consists of six layers, viz. (1) somatic ectoderm; (2) somatic
   mesoderm; (3) extraembryonic coelom; (4) capillaries; (5) endoderm; and
   (6) yolk syncytium. The epithelial ectoderm is a simple cuboidal
   epithelium possessing the normal complement of cytoplasmic organelles.
   The endoplasmic cisternae are dilated and vesicular. The epithelium rests
   upon a basal lamina below which is a collagenous stroma that contains
   dense bodies of varying diameter. They have a dense marginal zone, a less
   dense core, and a dense center. The squamous mesoderm has many
   pinocytotic caveolae. The capillary endothelium is adjacent to the
   mesoderm and is delimited by a basal lamina. The endoderm contains yolk
   degradation vesicles whose contents range from pale to dense. The yolk
   syncytium contains many morphologically diverse yolk granules in all
   phases of degradation. Concentric membrane lamellae form around yolk
   bodies as the main yolk granules begin to be degraded. During
   degradation, yolk platelets exhibit a vesicular configuration.

AB The epaulette shark, Hemiscyllium ocellatum, is a tropical reef shark
   that can live in an environment with cyclic periods of low oxygen
   concentration, suggesting that it has a well-developed capacity for
   anaerobic metabolism. Most investigations of hypoxia-tolerant teleosts
   and reptiles have focused on species that inhabit cold environments. This
   study was carried out on a tropical reef shark in order to determine
   whether similar strategies for hypoxia survival are used at higher
   environmental temperatures. We studied the effects of a single exposure
   to mild hypoxia and cyclic exposure to extreme hypoxia on blood-lactate
   concentration and key indicators of neurological function. The basal
   blood-lactate concentration for the epaulette shark was determined as
   0.37 mM and showed a graded increase during hypoxia. After a single
   exposure to mild hypoxia (20% of normoxia for 4 h), the mean
   blood-lactate level rose to 3.07 mM (P < 0.01). After cyclic exposure to
   extreme hypoxia (eight repetitions of a 120-min exposure at 5% of
   normoxia), there was a rise in mean blood-lactate concentration to 5.43
   mM (P < 0.0001). During both hypoxic regimens, there were no observed
   changes in key indicators of neurological function. We conclude that the
   epaulette shark is tolerant to both mild hypoxia and to cyclic exposure
   to extreme hypoxia.

   recently, Hox14 genes were discovered in three chordate lineages, the
   coelacanth, cartilaginous fishes, and amphioxus, but their expression
   patterns have not yet been analyzed. We isolated Hox14 cDNAs from the
   Japanese lamprey and cloudy catshark. These genes were not expressed in
   the central nervous systems, somites, or fin buds/folds but were
   expressed in a restricted cell population surrounding the hindgut. The
   lack of Hox14 expression in most of the embryonic axial elements, where
   nested Hox expressions define spatial identities, suggests a decoupling
   of Hox14 genes' regulation from the ancestral regulatory mechanism. The

   chains, which were different from the known cartilage collagen chains,
   were referred as C1, C2 and C3, had approximate molecular weights of 105
   kDa, 115 kDa and 130 kDa, respectively, and were present in a ratio of
   3:2:1, suggestive of two molecules of composition, [(C1)2C2] and
   [C1C2C3]. These collagens were purified by fractionation at acid and
   neutral pH, and by ammonium sulfate precipitation. Solubility data
   indicated that this collagen was more crosslinked than the type I
   collagen isolated from cartilage of shark, Carcharius acutus. In vitro
   fibrillogenesis revealed that the sepia collagen formed denser
   aggregates, as compared to shark collagen, and was stabilised by a higher
   degree of carbohydrate association. Polyclonal antisera raised against
   shark collagen was also reactive against the sepia collagens, while the
   converse was not true, indicating the high immunospecificity of the
   latter. These results demonstrate collagen polymorphism in an
   invertebrate cartilage and may hold significance in understanding tissue
   calcification and molecular evolution. Further, these collagens may
   represent ancestral forms of vertebrate minor collagens like typeV/XI.

   Intracellular chloride activity (64 mmol·l−1) was significantly higher

   Target-specific molecules were selected from a CDR3-randomized bamboo

   isolated by screening against several therapeutically relevant antigens,
   including the epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM), the Ephrin

   maturation was demonstrated for EpCAM and HTRA1 by diversifying CDR1 of
   target-enriched populations which allowed for the rapid selection of
   nanomolar binders. EpCAM-specific vNAR molecules were produced as soluble
   proteins and more extensively characterized via thermal shift assays and

PY 2005
AB The blue shark (Prionace glauca) is an oceanic species that occurs in
   temperate and tropical waters around the globe (Robins and Ray, 1986).
   This species is a major bycatch of pelagic longline fleets that operate
   to supply the world’s growing demand for tunas and swordfish (Xiphias
   gladius) (Stevens, 1992; Bailey et al., 1996; Francis, 1998; Francis et
   al., 2001; Macias and de la Serna, 2002); numerically, the blue shark is
   the top nontarget species captured by the U.S. longline pelagic Atlantic
   fleet (Beerkircher et al.

AB Ichthyoplankton data collected between 1997 and 2000 were combined with
   the results of numerical modelling to investigate the dispersal of
   snapper Pagrus auratus eggs and larvae in Shark Bay, Western Australia. A
   3-dimensional hydrodynamic model was coupled with a 2-dimensional
   Lagrangian particle-tracking program to simulate passive transport of
   these plank- tonic particles. Modelling analysed the separate and
   combined effects of the region's principal hydrodynamic forces of tide,
   wind and the Leeuwin Current. Model runs simulated a 30 d period to
   recreate residual transport on time scales encompassing early snapper
   development prior to settlement. Hydrodynamic conditions during winter
   were tidally dominated and exhibited minimal residual flows. Eggs and
   larvae were retained within residual eddies that were coincident with the
   4 main spawning areas. No connectivity between these areas was observed.
   The results provided further evidence of the existence of a number of
   proximate but geographically discrete spawning populations of snapper in
   Shark Bay waters. Hydrodynamic retention provides a mechanism that partly
   explains existing data indicating that snapper stock-structure in the
   region is complex. Such information is fundamental to determining the
   most appropriate geographic scale at which local snapper populations
   should be managed.

AB The caudal peduncle and caudal fin of Carcharodon carcharias together
   form a dynamic locomotory structure. The caudal peduncle is a highly
   modified, dorsoventrally compressed and rigid structure that facilitates
   the oscillations of the caudal fin. Its stiffness appears to be
   principally achieved by a thick layer of adipose tissue ranging from
   28–37% of its cross-sectional area, reinforced by cross-woven collagen
   fibers. Numerous overlying layers of collagen fibers of the stratum
   compactum, oriented in steep left- and right-handed helices (∼65° to the
   shark's long axis), prevent bowstringing of the perimysial fibers, which
   lie just below the dermal layer. Perimysial fibers, muscles, and the
   notochord are restricted to the dorsal lobe of the caudal fin and
   comprise the bulk of its mass. Adipose tissue reinforces the leading edge
   of the dorsal lobe of the caudal fin and contributes to maintaining the
   ideal cross-sectional geometry required of an advanced hydrofoil. Most of
   the mass of the ventral lobe consists of the ceratotrichia or fin rays
   separated by thin partitions of connective tissue. Dermal fibers of the
   stratum compactum of the dorsal lobe occur in numerous distinct layers.
   The layers are more complex than in other sharks and appear to reflect a
   hierarchical development in C. carcharias. The fiber layer comprises a
   number of thick fiber bundles along the height of the layer and the
   layers get thicker deeper into the stratum compactum. Each of these
   layers alternates with a layer a single fiber-bundle deep, a formation
   thought to give stability to the stratum compactum and to enable freer
   movements of the fiber system. In tangential sections of the stratum
   compactum the fiber bundles in the dorsal lobe can be seen oriented with
   respect to the long axis of the shark at ∼55–60° in left- and
   right-handed helices. Because of the backward sweep of the dorsal lobe
   (∼55° to the shark's long axis) the right-handed fibers also parallel the
   lobe's long axis. In the dorsal lobe, ceratotrichia are present only
   along the leading edge (embedded within connective tissue), apparently as
   reinforcement. Stratum compactum fiber bundles of the ventral lobe,
   viewed in transverse section, lack the well-ordered distinctive layers of
   the dorsal lobe, but rather occur as irregularly arranged masses of
   tightly compacted fiber bundles of various sizes. In tangential sections
   the fiber bundles are oriented at angles of ∼60°, generally in one
   direction, i.e., lacking the left- and right-handed helical pattern.
   Tensile load tests on the caudal fin indicate high passive resistance to
   bending by the skin. The shear modulus G showed that the skin's
   contribution to stiffness (average values from three specimens at radians
   0.52 and 1.05) is 33.5% for the dorsal lobe and 41.8% for the ventral.
   The load tests also indicate greater bending stiffness of the ventral
   lobe compared to the dorsal. Overall, the anatomy and mechanics of the
   dorsal lobe of C. carcharias facilitate greater control of movement
   compared to the ventral lobe. The helical fiber architecture near the
   surface of the caudal fin is analogous to strengthening of a thin
   cylinder in engineering. High fiber angles along the span of the dorsal
   lobe are considered ideal for resisting the bending stresses that the
   lobe is subjected to during the locomotory beat cycle. They are also
   ideal for storing strain energy during bending of the lobe and
   consequently may be of value in facilitating the recovery stroke. The
   complex fiber architecture of the caudal fin and caudal peduncle of C.
   carcharias provides considerable potential for an elastic mechanism in
   the animal's swimming motions and consequently for energy conservation.

AB Pop-up satellite archival tags (PSATs) are now widely used to document
   the geographic and vertical movements of large pelagic fishes. These
   instruments record measurements of ambient light, depth and temperature
   at regular intervals and the light data are used to compute daily
   estimates of latitude and longitude. Several methods have been developed
   to improve those estimates, including the application of Kalman filter
   models and matching sea surface temperatures (SST) from tags with
   remotely sensed SSTs. Despite their widespread use, few studies have
   evaluated the accuracy of raw estimates of location from PSATs or
   quantified the improvements that may result from refinement techniques.
   To assess the accuracy of raw and refined estimates of locations from
   PSATs, we attached two PSATs and one Argos satellite-linked transmitter
   (SAT tag) to one whale shark (Rhincodon typus) at Ningaloo Reef, Western
   Australia. The root mean square error (RMSE) in raw estimates of location
   provided by the PSATs was 5.16� latitude and 2.00� longitude. Estimates
   were more accurate after processing the data with a Kalman filter (RMSE =
   2.97� latitude and 0.78� longitude) and most accurate after processing
   with a Kalman filter model that integrates SST measurements (RMSE = 1.84�
   latitude and 0.78� longitude). We also assessed the precision of the
   PSAT-derived locations, and depth and temperature measurements by
   comparing the data from the two PSATs. Our findings support the use of
   archival tag data to reconstruct the large-scale movements of marine
   animals and demonstrate the significant improvements that may result from
   two refinement techniques.

   Carcharhinus obscurus had a diverse diet dominated by pelagic teleosts

   macki had a specialized diet, feeding almost exclusively on octopus and
   other cephalopods. The diet of M. antarcticus was dominated by benthic
   and epibenthic prey, including crabs, lobsters, tetraodontid fishes and
   octopus. As M. antarcticus increased in size there was an increase in the

   were 105.3 +/- 35.6 (SE) mg O2.kg-1.h-1 and 36.6 +/- 1.8 (SE)

   linear regression was obtained between metabolic rate and heart rate, a
   low overall correlation coefficient may result from the existence of
   separate individual regressions and confounding changes in stroke volume
   and/or arteriovenous oxygen difference. Heart rate was approximately as

AB The central nervous system location of neurochemicals that are widely
   distributed among extant animals may give us clues to changes that
   occurred in the brains of these animals during evolution. We have been
   studying the brains of cartilaginous fishes, a heterogeneous group whose
   central nervous system varies considerably. Squalus acanthias, the spiny
   dogfish shark, was chosen to represent the squalomorphs, a group of
   living sharks known to possess many primitive characters. The
   distribution of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH+), serotonin (5-HT+), and
   leu-enkephalin (LENK+) positive cells within the brainstem of Squalus was
   determined by use of antibodies to these substances. All the major raphe
   groups described for mammals were found in Squalus. The 5-HT+ cells in
   raphe nuclei were more uniformly distributed in Squalus than in
   Heterodontus, the horn shark. Other nuclei that were 5-HT+ and LENK+, and
   that have been identified in mammals, included reticularis
   paragigantocellularis lateralis, a B9 cell group, and reticularis
   magnocellularis. The postcommissural nucleus and pretectal area contained
   5-HT+ and LENK+ cells. These cells have been described in a
   holocephalian, in teleosts, and in reptiles but not in other
   elasmobranchs or in mammals. Cells that were TH+ were located in
   prominent A1/A2, A6 (locus coeruleus), A9 (substantia nigra), and A10
   (ventral tegmental area) cell groups, and in a very small A5 group. We
   conclude that the variation in chondrichthian brainstems exceeds that in
   mammals, and we suggest that this variation is related to life-style and
   the long evolutionary history of these fishes.

   shown that the lower conal valves close first and that this closure
   occurred before the end of ventricular systole. 3. The middle conal
   valves closed before the lower ones opened. The closure of both of these
   sets of valves was caused in part by the circumferential decrease due to
   conus systole, and in part by the back flow this engendered. 4. The upper
   conal valves closed as the middle ones opened at the end of conal
   systole. 5. Paralysing the conus with topical tricain rendered the lower
   and middle conal valves incompetent and caused the upper conal valves to
   be closed following ventricular relaxation with an increase in back flow.

   pressure generated by ventricular ejection has decayed to a lower value.

AB Sharks occupy marine habitats ranging from shallow, inshore environments
   to pelagic, and deepwaters, and thus provide a model system for testing
   how gross habitat differences have shaped vertebrate macroevolution.
   Palaeontological studies have shown that onshore lineages diversify more
   quickly than offshore taxa. Among onshore habitats, coral
   reef-association has been shown to increase speciation rates in several
   groups of fishes and invertebrates. In this study, we investigated
   whether speciation rates are habitat dependent by generating the first
   comprehensive molecular timescale for shark divergence. Using
   phylogenetic comparative methods, we rejected the hypothesis that shelf
   (i.e. onshore) lineages have higher speciation rates compared to those
   occupying deepwater and oceanic (i.e. offshore) habitats. Our results,
   however, support the hypothesis of increased speciation rates in coral
   reef-associated lineages within the Carcharhinidae. Our new timetree
   suggests that the two major shark lineages leading to the extant shark
   diversity began diversifying mostly after the end-Permian mass
   extinction: the squalimorphs into deepwater and the galeomorphs into
   shelf habitats. We suggest that the breakdown of the onshore–offshore
   speciation rate pattern in sharks is mediated by success in deepwater
   environments through ecological partitioning, and in some cases, the
   evolution of morphological novelty.

AB Abstract Dogfish sharks are opportunistic predators, eating large meals
   at irregular intervals. Here we present a synthesis of data from several
   previous studies on responses in plasma metabolites after natural feeding
   and during prolonged fasting (up to 56 days), together with new data on
   changes in plasma concentrations of amino acids and non-esterified fatty
   acids. Post-prandial and long-term fasting responses were compared to
   control sharks fasted for 7 days, a typical inter-meal interval. A
   feeding frenzy was created in which dogfish were allowed to feed
   naturally on dead teleosts at two consumed ration levels, 2.6% and 5.5%
   of body weight. Most responses were more pronounced at the higher ration
   level. These included increases in urea and TMAO concentrations at 20 h,
   followed by stability through to 56 days of fasting. Ammonia levels were
   low and exhibited little short-term response to feeding, but declined to
   very low values during the extended fast. Glucose and β-hydroxybutyrate
   both fell after feeding, the latter to a greater and more prolonged
   extent (up to 60 h), whereas acetoacetate did not change. During
   prolonged fasting, glucose concentrations were well regulated, but
   β-hydroxybutyrate increased to 2–3-fold control levels. Total plasma
   amino acid concentrations increased in a biphasic fashion, with peaks at
   6–20 h, and 48–60 h after the meal, followed by homeostasis during the
   extended fast. Essential and non-essential amino acids generally followed
   this same pattern, though some exhibited different trends after feeding:
   taurine, β-alanine, and glycine (decreases or stability), alanine and
   glutamine (modest prolonged increases), and threonine, serine,
   asparagine, and valine (much larger short-term increases). Plasma
   non-esterified fatty acid concentrations declined markedly through 48 h
   after the 2.6% meal. These data are interpreted in light of companion
   studies showing elevations in aerobic metabolic rate, urea production,
   rectal gland function, metabolic base excretion, and activation of
   ornithine–urea cycle and aerobic enzymes after the meal, and muscle
   N-depletion but maintenance of osmolality and urea production during
   long-term fasting.

AB Abstract Although the Brazilian sharpnose shark, Rhizoprionodon lalandii
   (Muller and Henle, 1839), is an inshore species widely distributed in the
   Western Atlantic from Panama to Uruguay, there is little available
   information on its biology. During a long-term study of small coastal
   sharks caught by gill net fisheries in southeastern Brazil (PROJETO
   CACAO), 3643 specimens of R. lalandii were examined, comprising 61.3% of
   the total sharks, and including all sizes classes, from 30 to 78.5 cm TL,
   and weights from 100 to 2950 g. The length–weight relationships were not
   significantly different between sexes. Overall sex ratio favoured the
   males slightly at the rate of 1.3:1. Sex ratios, however, did differ
   significantly between season and size classes. This species occurred in
   this area all year long. Three seasonal size-class occurrence patterns
   were recognized: (1) between October and March, the juveniles were more
   frequent; (2) from April to July, adults were most common; and (3) from
   August to September, neonates were most numerically abundant. Such
   patterns were associated with reproductive tactics that may reduce
   intra-specific and inter-specific competition with hammerhead shark
   neonates ( Sphyrna lewini ), probably result in reduced natural mortality
   of the offspring during their first few months.

AB : To examine the pattern of injuries in cases of fatal shark attack in
   South Australian waters, the authors examined the files of their
   institution for all cases of shark attack in which full autopsies had
   been performed over the past 25 years, from 1974 to 1998. Of the seven
   deaths attributed to shark attack during this period, full autopsies were
   performed in only two cases. In the remaining five cases, bodies either
   had not been found or were incomplete. Case 1 was a 27-year-old male
   surfer who had been attacked by a shark. At autopsy, the main areas of
   injury involved the right thigh, which displayed characteristic teeth
   marks, extensive soft tissue damage, and incision of the femoral artery.
   There were also incised wounds of the right wrist. Bony injury was
   minimal, and no shark teeth were recovered. Case 2 was a 26-year-old male
   diver who had been attacked by a shark. At autopsy, the main areas of
   injury involved the left thigh and lower leg, which displayed
   characteristic teeth marks, extensive soft tissue damage, and incised
   wounds of the femoral artery and vein. There was also soft tissue trauma
   to the left wrist, with transection of the radial artery and vein. Bony
   injury was minimal, and no shark teeth were recovered. In both cases,
   death resulted from exsanguination following a similar pattern of soft
   tissue and vascular damage to a leg and arm. This type of injury is in
   keeping with predator attack from underneath or behind, with the most
   severe injuries involving one leg. Less severe injuries to the arms may
   have occurred during the ensuing struggle. Reconstruction of the damaged
   limb in case 2 by sewing together skin, soft tissue, and muscle bundles
   not only revealed that no soft tissue was missing but also gave a clearer
   picture of the pattern of teeth marks, direction of the attack, and
   species of predator.

AB ABSTRACT Shark liver oil has been used for over 40 years as both a
   therapeutic and preventive agent. The active ingredients in shark liver
   oil have been found to be a group of ether-linked glycerols known as
   alkylglycerols. Initial clinical use was for treating leukemias, and
   later to prevent radiation sickness from cancer x-ray therapy. Studies
   over the last 30 years have shown that alkylglycerols are
   multifunctional. The level of natural alkylglycerols rises within tumor
   cells, apparently in an effort to control cell growth. Recent studies
   indicate that the activation of protein kinase C, an essential step in
   cell proliferation, can be inhibited by alkylglycerols. This action
   suggests a competitive inhibition of 1.2-diacylglycerol by
   alkylglycerols. Further studies on the immunostimulatory action of
   alkylglycerols suggest a primary action on the macrophage. The process of
   macrophage activation has been demonstrated with both synthetic and
   natural alkylglycerols. While the exact mechanism has not been fo...

AB Abstract Protein kinase C zeta (PKC zeta) is an atypical PKC isoform that
   has recently been implicated in cell division and cell growth. However,
   there has been no morphologic evidence for the involvement of PKC zeta in
   mitogenic signal transduction. Here we use immunocytochemistry to
   demonstrate that PKC zeta co-localizes with microtubules in both
   interphase and metaphase cells of the shark rectal gland in primary
   culture. This co-localization is present after non-ionic detergent
   treatment and is disrupted by nocodazole. During mitosis, PKC zeta is
   associated with the mitotic apparatus and co-localizes with beta-tubulin
   in spindle microtubules, while entirely sparing astral microtubules.
   These findings provide the first evidence that PKC zeta is associated
   with the mitotic apparatus. The striking presence of PKC zeta in the
   central portion of the mitotic apparatus suggests a functional role for
   this kinase isoform in cell division.

AB Distribution, population structure and reproduction are described for the
   southern lantern shark Etmopterus granulosus at the Chatham Rise, New
   Zealand. Depth of capture for E. granulosus ranged from 744 to 1420 m,
   with highest catch rates between 800–1200 m. More than twice as many
   females as males were captured, and the majority of sharks caught were
   mature, indicating that there may be segregation according to sex and
   size class. Only 10 of 492 female sharks captured contained ova in uteri,
   and none contained embryos. The absence of pregnant females suggests that
   they move to another area or depth prior to pupping. Size of sharks
   captured ranged from 20·0 to 78·8 cm total length. Females began to
   mature at 62 cm total length, and males at 52 cm. There was no evidence
   of a seasonal reproductive cycle. Ovulation appeared to occur when ova
   reached a diameter of 40–45 mm. The average number of ova in mature
   females was 12·7. This information is crucial for assessing the impact of
   fisheries on E. granulosus populations.

AB Background: On average there are approximately 50 confirmed shark attacks
   worldwide annually. Despite their rarity, such incidents often generate
   much public and media attention. Methods: The injuries of 86 consecutive
   victims of shark attack were reviewed from 1980 to 1999. Clinical data
   retrieved from the South African Shark Attack Files, maintained by the
   Natal Sharks Board, were retrospectively analyzed to determine the
   nature, treatment, and outcome of injuries. Results: The majority of
   victims (n = 68 [81%]) had relatively minor injuries that required simple
   primary suture. Those patients (n = 16 [19%]) with more extensive limb
   lacerations longer than 20 cm or with soft-tissue loss of more than one
   myofascial compartment were associated with higher morbidity and limb
   loss. In 8 of the 10 fatalities, death occurred as a result of
   exsanguinating hemorrhage from a limb vascular injury. Conclusion:
   Victims of shark attack usually sustain only minor injuries. In more
   serious cases, particularly if associated with a major vascular injury,
   hemorrhage control and early resuscitation are of utmost importance
   during the initial management if these patients are to survive.

   data were as follows: L∞ = 337 cm fork length, k = 0.178, and t0 = -1.12.
   Monthly length- frequency data for six year classes from birth to two
   years old for tiger sharks were used to verify the tag-recapture growth
   curve for this age range. The predicted age at maturity is 7 years for
   both sexes. Data from an ongoing in situ study with oxytetracycline were
   used in conjunction with length data to de- termine the effect of tagging

AB ABSTRACT Some specimens of the Late Cretaceous lamniform shark,
   Cretoxyrhina mantelli (Agassiz), from the Niobrara Chalk in Kansas are
   represented by partial skeletons. The vertebral and neurocranial
   structures of C. mantelli suggest its placement in Lamniformes. The
   pectoral fins of C. mantelli may be plesodic, possibly indicating that
   the taxon is an “advanced” lamnoid. The total vertebral count of C.
   mantelli, approximately 230, is a unique number among lamniforms,
   supporting the view based on tooth-based taxonomy that this taxon is a
   distinct species. The total length of large C. mantelli is estimated to
   be 5 m. Very large C. mantelli possibly attained a total length of about
   6 m or slightly more. Cretoxyrhina mantelli possessed a conical head with
   a blunt snout and large eyes. The body form of C. mantelli could have
   resembled that of extant Carcharodon carcharias.

AB : The rotational motions of immunoglobulin M (IgM) were investigated by
   the nanosecond fluorescence depolarization technique. The fluorophore
   epsilon-1-dimethylamino-5-naphthalenesulfonyl-L-lysine (DNS-lysine) was
   specifically bound in the combining sites of anti-DNS IgM antibodies from
   the horse, pig, and nurse shark. Fluorescence lifetime analysis showed
   the presence of a long lifetime component (21-27 ns) with antibodies from
   all three species. With the mammalian antibodies, the fluorophore
   appeared to be rigidly bound in the combining sites as judged by the
   presence of induced circular dichroism of DNS-lysine (equine antibodies)
   and single exponential anisotropy decay of the isolated Fabmu fragments
   (equine and porcine antibodies). The small amount of available purified
   nurse shark antibody did not allow preparation of fragments or induced
   circular dichroism measurements to directly determine rigidity of
   fluorophore binding. However, at least some of the hapten must have been
   rigidly bound since long rotational correlation times were measured for
   the shark DNS-lysine-anti-DNS complexes. When the emission anisotropy of
   the fluorophore-anti-DNS IgM complexes was measured as a function of
   time, it was found that all three antibody species exhibited restricted
   segmental flexibility in the nanosecond time range. Moreover, when the
   equine anti-DNS IgM was exposed to 1 M acetic acid for 1 h, the antibody
   underwent a conformational change which resulted in an increase in its
   overall flexibility. Comparison of the rotational correlation times of
   native equine IgM and of proteolytic fragments indicated that flexibility
   of IgM consists of either hindered rotation of the Fab'mu segment or a
   combination of at least two modes of motion: rotation of Fabmu and/or
   Fab'mu and bending of the entire (Fab')2mu region as a unit. Similar
   modes of flexibility also occur in native porcine IgM. In acid exposed
   equine IgM, the major contribution to depolarization is from independent
   rotation or wagging of the Fab'mu segments. Thus, acid apparently causes
   a conformational change in or near the Cmu2 domains. In contrast,
   flexibility in nurse shark IgM appears to involve only bending of
   (Fab')2mu as a unit. Our results suggest that segmental flexibility is an
   essential functional feature of all IgM antibodies and that control of
   this flexibility through domain interactions may play an important role
   in such conformationally sensitive functions as complement fixation.

   sulfate reduction was undetectable in underlying sediments. The rates of
   sulfate reduction in sediments close to intertidal stromatolites and in

   intertidal zone stromatolitic debris has formed sediments in which
   sulfate reduction is rapid (14-46 mmol m-2d-1). Sulfur isotope
   distribution indicates a semiclosed system in the latter sediments

AB SUMMARY Vertebrates have evolved electrosensory receptors that detect
   electrical stimuli on the surface of the skin and transmit them
   somatotopically to the brain. In chondrichthyans, the electrosensory
   system is composed of a cephalic network of ampullary organs, known as
   the ampullae of Lorenzini, that can detect extremely weak electric fields
   during hunting and navigation. Each ampullary organ consists of a
   gel-filled epidermal pit containing sensory hair cells, and synaptic
   connections with primary afferent neurons at the base of thepit that
   facilitate detection of voltage gradients over large regions of the body.
   The developmental origin of electroreceptors and the mechanisms that
   determine their spatial arrangement in the vertebrate head are not well
   understood. We have analyzed electroreceptor development in the lesser
   spotted catshark (Scyliorhinus canicula) and show that Sox8 and HNK1, two
   markers of the neural crest lineage, selectively mark sensory cells in
   ampullary organs. This represents the first evidence that the neural
   crest gives rise to electrosensory cells. We also show that pathfinding
   by cephalic mechanosensory and electrosensory axons follows the
   expression pattern of EphA4, a well-known guidance cue for axons and
   neural crest cells in osteichthyans. Expression of EphrinB2, which
   encodes a ligand for EphA4, marks the positions at which ampullary
   placodes are initiated in the epidermis, and EphA4 is expressed in
   surrounding mesenchyme. These results suggest that Eph–Ephrin signaling
   may establish an early molecular map for neural crest migration, axon
   guidance and placodal morphogenesis during development of the shark
   electrosensory system.

   assess fine-scale variation in densities of 2 elasmobranchs (blacktip
   reef sharks Carcharhinus melanopterus and pink whiprays Himantura fai) on
   reef systems off Moorea (French Polynesia). We flew parallel transects
   designed to sample reef habitats (fringing, channel and sandflat
   habitats) across 2 survey blocks. Block 1 included a shark and ray
   provisioning site with potentially higher elasmobranch densities, whereas
   Block 2 most likely had lower densities with no provisioning activities.
   Across 10 survey days in July 2014, we flew 3 transects (400 m) within
   each survey block (n = 60 total transect passes). As expected, densities
   (animals ha−1) were significantly higher in Block 1 than in Block 2,
   particularly where provisioning activities occur. Differences between
   habitats surveyed were also found. Our study provides the first direct
   estimates of shark and ray densities in coral-reef ecosystems and
   demonstrates that UAVs can produce important fishery-independent data for
   elasmobranchs, particularly in shallow-water habitats.

AB ABSTRACT An exceptionally well-preserved white shark fossil (Carcharodon
   sp.) is described here from the early Pliocene (ca. 4 Ma) Pisco Formation
   of southwestern Peru. This specimen preserves 222 teeth and 45 vertebrae
   as well as fragmentary jaws. The teeth show characters of Carcharodon,
   including weak serrations and a symmetrical first anterior tooth that is
   the largest in the tooth row. This dentition also shows a character of
   Isurus with a distally inclined but mesially slanted intermediate tooth.
   Although the Pisco specimen demonstrates characters of both Isurus, also
   known form the Pisco Formation, and modern Carcharodon carcharias, it is
   assigned to the genus Carcharodon and referred to herein as Carcharodon
   sp. While Carcharodon sp. From the Pisco Formation shows numerous
   diagnostic characteristics shared with C. carcharias, it differs from the
   extant species in having a distal inclination of the intermediate tooth.

   drifting longline fi shery on shark pop- ulations was carried out in the
   eastern Mediterranean Sea. A total of 8 different pelagic shark species
   were recorded in the catches of the Greek swordfish and albacore longline
   fisheries. Among them, the blue shark, Prionace glauca, was the most
   common species in the catches while the bigeyed sixgill shark, Hexanchus
   nakamurai , was reported for the fi rst time in the area. Shark
   by-catches were noteworthy in the swordfish fishery reaching a 3.8% in
   number and 3.6% in biomass of the total catch. The higher abundance
   indices were observed in the Levantine Basin (CPUE = 0.74 sharks/1,000
   hooks). Catch - es in this area consisted of much lar ger specimens than
   those measured in other areas of the Mediterranean Sea.

AB Abstract Cretalamna ( = Cretolamna) appendiculata is an extinct lamniform
   shark primarily known by isolated teeth and traditionally classified into
   Cretoxyrhinidae. Here, a partial skeleton of C. appendiculata from the
   Upper Cretaceous Niobrara Chalk of Kansas is described. The reconstructed
   dentition partially corroborated with some articulated teeth on an upper
   jaw indicates that the shark had a lamnoid tooth pattern. Adjacent teeth
   apparently abutted each other without overlap and the dentition likely
   had a cutting function. The reconstruction presented here differs from
   previously published reconstructed dentitions of C. appendiculata based
   on isolated teeth or purely disarticulated tooth sets. The overall dental
   pattern of C. appendiculata is found to be more similar to the pattern of
   extant Lamna spp. than to that of a cretoxyrhinid, Cretoxyrhina mantelli,
   possibly indicating that Cretalamna appendiculata may not belong to
   Cretoxyrhinidae. The estimated jaw lengths indicate an upper jaw

AB Aminosterols isolated from the dogfish shark Squalus acanthias are
   promising therapeutic agents in the treatment of infection and cancer.
   One of these, MSI-1436, has been shown to possess antimicrobial activity
   slightly better than squalamine. In this study, a series of analogs of
   MSI-1436 have been synthesized from stigmasterol. The 7α-hydroxy
   substituent of MSI-1436 was either omitted or the stereochemistry
   modified to the 7β position. Also, analogs of MSI-1436 with 24-sulfate,
   24-amino, and 24-hydroxy substituents were synthesized in order to assess
   the importance of the side chain functional group on antimicrobial
   activity. All of the analogs possess significant antimicrobial activity,
   suggesting that substitution at C7 and C24 of the aminosterols plays a
   minor role in their antimicrobial potency.

AB Abstract Serial blood samples were collected from the unfed spiny dogfish
   shark ( Squalus acanthias ) by use of a cannula chronically implanted in
   the dorsal aorta. Plasma glucose, alanine, lactate, and β-hydroxybutyrate
   levels were estimated by standard enzymatic procedures. The metabolite
   levels were estimated immediately after the surgery, for an additional 3
   to 5 postoperative days before experimental use, and for 7 to 9 days
   after a single infusion of mammalian insulin (50, 100, and 250 IU/kg body
   wt) or the control solution. Plasma glucose, alanine, and lactate levels
   declined for 1 or 2 days after the surgery, but β-hydroxybutyrate levels
   were essentially unchanged. Plasma glucose levels remained relatively
   stable for the remainder of the pretreatment period, and in the control
   animals during the subsequent treatment period. In contrast, plasma
   alanine and β-hydroxybutyrate levels increased during both the
   pretreatment period and the treatment period in the control animals.
   Plasma lactate levels increased in the control animals after Day 3 of the
   treatment period. Insulin infusions resulted in severe, prolonged
   depressions of plasma glucose and alanine levels. Plasma lactate levels
   also fell after insulin infusion, but the depressed levels were
   interrupted by precipitous, large increases, followed by sharp declines,
   that were evident for one to three sampling periods and whose onset
   varied between Days 3 and 5 in individual animals. The levels increased
   again in some animals between Days 6 and 9. Plasma β-hydroxybutyrate
   levels were comparatively resistant to insulin. After an early decline,
   plasma β-hydroxybutyrate rose to levels that were near the control levels
   by Days 2 through 4, but fell to near the initial levels by Day 5 and
   thereafter. The results suggest that the spiny dogfish, a species that
   consumes reliable and abundant amounts of protein and lipid, but little
   carbohydrate, and that may feed as seldom as every 2 weeks, uses ketone
   bodies (β-hydroxybutyrate and presumably acetoacetate) as primary fuels.
   Glucose is apparently synthesized by gluconeogenesis, alanine and lactate
   are problble substrates, and ketone bodies are the likely sources of
   energy. The evidence supports the hypothesis that glucose is synthesized
   to maintain muscle glycogen reserves that are used for anaerobic
   glycolysis when the animal is engaged in predation, escape, or other
   circumstances that dictate vigorous swimming. If other tissues and organs
   require glucose as a fuel source, the amounts must be exceptionally
   small.

AB Nineteen sharks collected from freshwater at several points on Lake
   Nicaragua and the Rio San Juan were all of the same species and indis­
   tinguishable from marine Carcharhinus leucas of the Atlantic. Minor
   differences previously thought to separate C. leucas from the lake shark
   proved to be invalid. Females had slightly longer gill slits, somewhat
   greater breadth of pelvic fin, and a longer abdominal region than males.
   Clasper length indicated that the onset of sexual maturity in males
   occurs when they are between 1,600 and 1,700 mm in total length. The
   classical theory or origin of the sharks from Pacific ancestry no longer
   appears tenable. An Atlantic origin is indicated by (a) strong evidence
   that the taxonomic affinities not only of the shark, but also of the
   sawfish and tarpon, are more pronouncedly with Atlantic relatives than
   with those of the Pacific, (b) recent evidence that Lake Nicaragua may
   never have been a part of the Pacific but opened originally to the
   Atlantic, (c) the fact that Lake Nicaragua drains into the Caribbean Sea
   by a large, broad river, and (d) all three of the large, otherwise marine
   types of fish occurring in the lake are species that habitually
   congregate in brackish water and frequently move up rivers. Evidence that
   the sharks are not landlocked includes the following facts: (a) they are
   abundant the full length of the river, (b) barges drawing from one to
   three feet of water regularly negotiate the river (including all of the
   rapids) in both directions, (c) sharks were observed both below and above
   the three major rapids as well as actually in the rapids, most of them
   headed upstream.

AB Changes in vascular pressures, blood respiratory properties and blood gas
   transport induced by swimming were investigated in the leopard shark
   Triakis semifasciata (Girard). In resting sharks, the mean ventral and
   dorsal aortic pressures (systolic/diastolic) were 6.8/5.6 kPa and 4.5/3.9
   kPa, respectively, and only the former were increased significantly
   during swimming. Swimming also caused a significant decline in venous Po2
   (1.6 to 0.9kPa), O2 content (0.9 to 0.4mmoill−1) and percentage O2
   saturation {SO2, 39 to 18%) but the arterial variables were not affected.
   A significant decline in venous pH and an increase in venous Po2 also
   occurred during swimming but lactate concentration did not increase
   during or after swimming. An in vivo dissociation curve compiled from
   blood Po2 and So2 data for sharks in the resting, swimming and
   post-swimming recovery phases shows a mean P50 of 2.04 kPa, as determined
   by Hill transformation. The pH-bicarbonate plot for this fish shows a
   weak blood buffer capacity of 9.3mmoll−11pHunit−1 and during swimming the
   average blood pH and bicarbonateconcentration follow the buffer line
   which was not compensated in recovery. Neither oxygenated nor
   deoxygenated blood pH values were affected by CO2 equilibration,
   suggesting the absence of a Haldane effect. Thus, at the expense of
   respiratory acidosis, Triakis can aerobically sustain long (up to 60min)
   and moderately intense (0.45 Ls−1, where L is body length) periods of
   swimming by increasing cardiac output and tapping its venous reserve.

AB We quantified placoid scale morphology and flexibility in the shortfin
   mako Isurus oxyrinchus and the blacktip shark Carcharhinus limbatus. The
   shortfin mako shark has shorter scales than the blacktip shark. The
   majority of the shortfin mako shark scales have three longitudinal
   riblets with narrow spacing and shallow grooves. In comparison, the
   blacktip shark scales have five to seven longitudinal riblets with wider
   spacing and deeper grooves. Manual manipulation of the scales at 16
   regions on the body and fins revealed a range of scale flexibility, from
   regions of nonerectable scales such as on the leading edge of the fins to
   highly erectable scales along the flank of the shortfin mako shark body.
   The flank scales of the shortfin mako shark can be erected to a greater
   angle than the flank scales of the blacktip shark. The shortfin mako
   shark has a region of highly flexible scales on the lateral flank that
   can be erected to at least 508. The scales of the two spe- cies are
   anchored in the stratum laxum of the dermis. The attachment fibers of the
   scales in both species appear to be almost exclusively collagen, with
   elastin fibers visible in the stratum laxum of both species. The most
   erectable scales of the shortfin mako shark have long crowns and
   relatively short bases that are wider than long. The combination of a
   long crown length to short base length facilitates pivoting of the
   scales. Erec- tion of flank scales and resulting drag reduction is
   hypothesized to be passively driven by localized flow patterns over the
   skin. J. Morphol. 000:000-000, 2012. 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB Stable isotope data are useful for inferring foraging and niche variation
   in marine taxa but can be difficult to interpret, in part because
   different foraging patterns may result in sim- ilar isotopic values.
   Here, we integrate stable isotope analysis (! 13 C and ! 15 N) with
   behavioral data to investigate the foraging ecology of loggerhead turtles
   Caretta caretta on a feeding ground in Shark Bay, Western Australia.
   Large loggerhead turtles showed little among-individual isotopic variance
   in skin samples, suggesting similar foraging or habitat use patterns over
   several months or more. Analysis of loggerhead foraging in video data,
   and comparison with isotopic variance for sympatric green turtles
   Chelonia mydas, suggest that low isotopic variance among large logger-
   heads reflects a similar, highly generalized diet within individuals.
   Higher isotopic variance among smaller turtles may reflect variation in
   diet, timing of recruitment to neritic habitat or use of food webs
   varying along other isotopic gradients. Loggerheads showed strong
   fidelity to the study site over many years, and individuals recaptured
   frequently showed remarkable affinity for very small geographic areas,
   often < 5 km 2 . Thus, a substantial proportion of the Shark Bay logger-
   head population comprises site specialists, with larger adults appearing
   to be diet generalists. Our results also suggest that among-individual
   isotopic variation found at some loggerhead nesting locations may reflect
   the isotopic characteristics of preferred migratory or foraging grounds
   owing to long-term site fidelity and less likely reflects prey
   specialization by individuals within specific feeding areas.

AB Abstract The present study reports aspects of GI tract physiology in the

   stomach fluid osmolality and solute values were comparable between
   species, and stomach pH was low in all species (2.2 to 3.4) suggesting
   these elasmobranchs may maintain a consistently low stomach pH.
   Intestinal osmolality, pH and ion values were comparable between species,
   however, some differences in ion values were observed. In particular Ca2+
   (19.67 ± 3.65 mM) and Mg2+ (43.99 ± 5.11 mM) were high in L. erinacea and
   Mg2+ was high (130.0 ± 39.8 mM) in C. palgiosum which may be an
   indication of drinking. Furthermore, intestinal fluid HCO3− values were
   low (8.19 ± 2.42 and 8.63 ± 1.48 mM) in both skates but very high in C.
   plagiosum (73.3 ± 16.3 mM) suggesting ingested seawater may be processed
   by species-specific mechanisms. Urea values from the intestine to the
   colon dropped precipitously in all species, with the greatest decrease
   seen in C. plagiosum (426.0 ± 8.1 to 0 mM). This led to the examination
   of the molecular expression of both a urea transporter and a Rhesus like
   ammonia transporter in the intestine, rectal gland and kidney in L.
   erinacea. Both these transporters were expressed in all tissues; however,
   expression levels of the Rhesus like ammonia transporter were orders of
   magnitude higher than the urea transporter in the same tissue. Intestinal
   flux rates of solutes in L. erinacea were, for the most part, in an
   inward direction with the notable exception of urea. Colon flux rates of
   solutes in L. erinacea were all in an outward direction, although
   absolute rates were considerably lower than the intestine, suggestive of
   a much tighter epithelia. Results are discussed in the context of the
   potential role of the GI tract in salt and water, and nitrogen,

AB Protective gillnets (shark nets) have been successful in reducing the
   frequency of shark attacks on the coast of Natal, South Africa. This is
   achieved primarily through a reduction in numbers of large sharks. The
   nets also take a by catch of dolphins, sea turtles, batoids and teleosts.
   Concern has been expressed over the direct effect of mortalities on the
   various stocks and also the broader, indirect effects on the inshore
   system. Catch rates of most shark species declined initially but have
   shown no trend since the mid-1970s. A first estimate of the reduction in
   total shark numbers is provided, and factors such as stock identity and
   net avoidance are discussed. Turtle and teleost stocks do not appear to
   be threatened by net mortalities but marine mammalogists are
   investigating the sustainability of catches of two dolphin species.
   Certain batoids may have declined despite a high release rate, but more
   data are needed. A published contention that shark netting has resulted
   in a proliferation of small sharks through reduced predation is
   re-examined and considered to be exaggerated. Reduced predation on
   dolphins, as a result of shark netting, is estimated.

   up to about 20°C, and non-linear above this temperature. The Arrhenius
   plots of mammalian enzyme (ox brain and kidney) were steeper, especially
   at temperatures below 20–30°C, than that of shark enzyme. The Na +
   -ATPase activity showed a weaker temperature-dependence than the Na + /K
   + -ATPase activity. The phosphatase reactions measured, K + -stimulated,
   Na + /K + -stimulated and Na + /K + /ATPase-stimulated, also showed a
   weaker temperature-dependence than the overall Na + /K + -ATPase
   activity. Among the phosphatase reactions, the largest change in slope of
   the Arrhenius plot was observed with the Na + /K + /ATP)-stimulated
   phosphatase reaction. The Arrhenius plots of the partial reactions were
   all non-linear. Solubilization of shark enzyme in C 12 E 8 did not change
   the curvature of Arrhenius plots of the Na + /K + -ATPase activity or the
   K + -phosphatase activity. Since solubilization involves a disruption of
   the membrane and an 80% delipidation, the observed curvature of the
   Arrhenius plot can not be attributed to a property of the membrane as
   such.

   squaloids contained additionally hydrocarbons. Prionace contained
   triglycerides and hydrocarbons but no alkyldiacylglycerols. For a given
   species the class compositions of the lipids were similar in liver,

   both of which transport all four neutral lipids in serum. It is concluded

   marketed based on traditional Chinese medicine claims that it nourishes
   the blood, enhances appetite, and energizes multiple internal organs.
   Shark cartilage contains a mixture of chondroitin and glucosamine, a
   popular nutritional supplement ingested to improve cartilage function.
   Sharks are long-lived apex predators, that bioaccumulate environmental
   marine toxins and methylmercury from dietary exposures. We recently
   reported detection of the cyanobacterial toxin β- N -methylamino- l
   -alanine (BMAA) in the fins of seven different species of sharks from
   South Florida coastal waters. Since BMAA has been linked to degenerative
   brain diseases, the consumption of shark products may pose a human risk
   for BMAA exposures. In this report, we tested sixteen commercial shark
   cartilage supplements for BMAA by high performance liquid chromatography
   (HPLC-FD) with fluorescence detection and ultra performance liquid
   chromatography/mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry (UPLC–MS/MS). Total
   mercury (Hg) levels were measured in the same shark cartilage products by
   cold vapor atomic fluorescence spectrometry (CVAFS). We report here that
   BMAA was detected in fifteen out of sixteen products with concentrations
   ranging from 86 to 265 μg/g (dry weight). All of the shark fin products
   contained low concentrations of Hg. While Hg contamination is a known
   risk, the results of the present study demonstrate that shark cartilage
   products also may contain the neurotoxin BMAA. Although the neurotoxic
   potential of dietary exposure to BMAA is currently unknown, the results
   demonstrate that shark cartilage products may contain two environmental
   neurotoxins that have synergistic toxicities.

TI Catch and Bycatch in the Shark Drift Gillnet Fishery off Georgia and East

AB An observer program of the shark drift gillnet fishery off the Atlantic
   coast of Florida and Georgia was begun in 1993 to define the fishery and
   estimate bycatch including bottlenose dolphin, Tursiops truncatus, and
   sea turtles. Boats in the fishery were 12.2-19.8 m long. Nets used were
   275-1,800 m long and 3.2-4.1 m deep. Stretched-mesh sizes used were
   12.7-29.9 cm. Fishing trips were usually <18 h and occurred within 30
   n.mi. of port. Fishing with an observer aboard occurred between Savannah,
   Ga., and Jacksonville, Fla., and off Cape Canaveral, Fla. Nets were set
   at least 3 n.mi. offshore. Numbers of boats in the fishery increased from
   5 in 1993 to 11 in 1995, but total trips decreased from 185 in 1994 to
   149 in 1995. During 1993-95, 48 observer trips were completed and 52 net
   sets were observed. No marine mammals were caught and two loggerhead
   turtles, Caretta caretta, were caught and released alive. A total of
   9,270 animals (12 shark, 21 teleost, 4 ray, and 1 sea turtle species)
   were captured. Blacknose, Carcharhinus acronotus; Atlantic sharpnose,
   Rhizoprionodon terraenovae; and blacktip shark, C. limbatus), were the
   dominant sharks caught. King mackerel, Scomberomorus cavalIa; little
   tunny, Euthynnus alleteratus; and cownose ray, Rhinoptera bonasus, were
   the dominant bycatch species. About 8.4% of the total catch was bycatch.
   Of the totals, 9.4% of the sharks and 37.3% ofthe bycatch were discarded.

   In two sets of respirometry experiments, sharks were randomly exposed to
   seawater in oxygen contents of 6.0, 5.0, 4.0 and 3.0 mg l −1 . During
   exposure, bonnetheads increased mouth gape from 0.8 cm at 6.0 mg l −1 to
   2.2 cm at 3.0 mg l −1 , while ventilation volume increased from 0.61 to
   5.28 l min −1 kg −1 . Standard oxygen consumption remained unchanged
   (163–181 mg O 2 kg −1 h −1 ) throughout all treatments and was not
   significantly different. Utilization (%) declined from 52.3% at 6.0 mg l
   −1 to 21.3% when oxygen levels reached 3.0 mg l −1 . Changes in oxygen
   content of ambient water also caused no significant change in either
   blood oxygen content or hematocrit. Using cellulose acetate
   electrophoresis, a single hemoglobin profile was identified at seawater
   of 6.0 mg l −1 and hypoxic conditions. Results suggest bonnetheads are
   physiologically able to tolerate moderate levels of hypoxia.

AB Ontogenetic changes in habitat are driven by shifting life-history
   requirements and play an important role in population dynamics. However,
   large portions of the life history of many pelagic species are still
   poorly understood or unknown. We used a novel combination of stable
   isotope analysis of vertebral annuli, Bayesian mixing models, isoscapes
   and electronic tag data to reconstruct ontogenetic patterns of habitat
   and resource use in a pelagic apex predator, the salmon shark (Lamna
   ditropis). Results identified the North Pacific Transition Zone as the
   major nursery area for salmon sharks and revealed an ontogenetic shift
   around the age of maturity from oceanic to increased use of neritic
   habitats. The nursery habitat may reflect trade-offs between prey
   availability, predation pressure and thermal constraints on juvenile
   endothermic sharks. The ontogenetic shift in habitat coincided with a
   reduction of isotopic niche, possibly reflecting specialization upon
   particular prey or habitats. Using tagging data to inform Bayesian
   isotopic mixing models revealed that adult sharks primarily use neritic
   habitats of Alaska yet receive a trophic subsidy from oceanic habitats.
   Integrating the multiple methods used here provides a powerful approach
   to retrospectively study the ecology and life history of migratory
   species throughout their ontogeny.

   Co 2+ , Sn 2+ Cu 2+ and Zn 2+ ) on vascular tension was studied using
   isolated rings of endothelium-free, smooth muscle from the ventral aorta
   of the shark, Squalus acanthias . Both Cd 2+ and Ni 2+ produced
   significant vasoconstriction at concentration at or above 10 −6 M (112
   and 59 ppb, respectively); the other metals were either marginally
   constrictive (Hg 2+ and Sn 2+ ) or were without effect (Pb 2+ , Co 2+ ,
   Cu 2+ , and Zn 2+ ). We suggest that previously published vascular
   effects of Hg 2+ and Pb 2+ may have been secondary to responses of the
   vascular endothelium, and that the role of Ni 2+ in hypertension should
   be investigated further. Our data indicate that the effects of metals on
   this vascular smooth muscle are specific and not generic. Moreover, this
   system could be utilized to investigate the mechanisms of metal-induced
   vasoconstriction.

AB Accurately surveying shark populations is critical to monitoring
   precipitous ongoing declines in shark abundance and interpreting the
   effects that these reductions are having on ecosystems. To evaluate the
   effectiveness of existing survey tools, we used field trials and computer
   simulations to critically examine the operation of four common methods
   for counting coastal sharks: stationary point counts, belt transects,
   video surveys, and mark and recapture abundance estimators. Empirical and
   theoretical results suggest that (1) survey method selection has a strong
   impact on the estimates of shark density that are produced, (2)
   standardizations by survey duration are needed to properly interpret and
   compare survey outputs, (3) increasing survey size does not necessarily
   increase survey precision, and (4) methods that yield the highest density
   estimates are not always the most accurate. These findings challenge some
   of the assumptions traditionally associated with surveying mobile marine
   animals. Of the methods we trialed, 8 × 50 m belt transects and a 20 m
   radius point count produced the most accurate estimates of shark density.
   These findings can help to improve the ways we monitor, manage, and
   understand the ecology of globally imperiled coastal shark populations.

AB Shark-liver oil (SLO) contains two bioactive lipids: alkylglycerols and
   n-3 PUFA. Alkylglycerols have immunostimulating and haematopoietic
   properties, while n-3 PUFA are essential for optimal neonatal
   development. We investigated the beneficial effects of dietary
   supplementation with 32 g SLO/d to twelve pregnant and then lactating
   sows (from day 80 of pregnancy to weaning) on the growth and immune
   status of their offspring, compared with a control group. Sows were
   vaccinated against Aujeszky's disease 21 d before term. Blood samples
   were collected from sows before treatment, on delivery and 14 d later,
   and from five piglets per litter on days 2, 21 and 36 after birth;
   colostrum and milk samples were collected 12 h, 14 and 28 d postpartum.
   Compared with controls, supplemented sows had higher levels of both
   erythrocytes and Hb in their blood, and higher concentrations of IgG,
   alkylglycerols and n-3 PUFA in their mammary secretions. In piglets from
   supplemented sows, leucocytes and IgG were higher. Supplementation with
   SLO resulted in an increase in Aujeszky antibodies in both blood and
   colostrum of sows after vaccination, together with an increase in
   Aujeszky antibodies in piglet blood. Our findings demonstrate that
   improvement of both passive and active immune status in piglets is
   related to the consumption of alkylglycerols associated with n-3 PUFA in
   the sow diet. The overall improvement in offspring health status by SLO
   supplementation to the mother could be of interest for optimisation of
   the lipid diet during and after pregnancy.

   availability bias (the proportion of animals invisible because of water
   turbidity) with survey-specific correction factors. The resultant minimum
   population estimate was 10146 ± 1665 (s.e.) dugongs at an overall density
   of 0.71 ± 0.12 (s.e.) dugongs km-2, the highest density ever recorded on
   a large-scale dugong survey. The proportion of calves (19%) was higher
   than for most other dugong surveys conducted in Shark Bay and elsewhere,
   suggesting an exceptionally high calving rate in 1988. Dugong density was
   highest (>5 km-2) in relatively deep water (12-16 m) in the eastern half
   of Shark Bay opposite the tip of Peron Peninsula and in the western Bay
   opposite the northern half of Dirk Hartog Island. Fewer than 4% of
   dugongs sighted in Shark Bay during the survey were in waters colder than
   18°C. Results of aerial surveys over 906 km2 in the Faure Sill region of
   the eastern Bay in November 1990 and January 1991 suggest that between a
   third and a half of the dugongs in Shark Bay are located in this region
   during the summer. In contrast, only one dugong was sighted there during
   the winter survey. The survey confirms that Shark Bay is an
   internationally significant dugong habitat.

AB : The Atlantic sharpnose shark Rhizoprionodon terraenovae (Richardson) is
   a small carcharhinid that is a common year-round resident along the
   southeast coast of the United States. It is viviparous and its embryos
   develop an epithelio-vitelline placenta. Females enter shallow water to
   give birth in late May and early June. Mating occurs shortly after
   parturition, and four to seven eggs are ovulated. Fertilized eggs attain
   the blastoderm stage in early June to early July. Separate compartments
   for each egg are formed in the uterus when the embryos reach 3-30 mm.
   Embryos depend on yolk for the first 8 weeks of development. When embryos
   reach 72 mm their yolk supply is nearly depleted and they shift to
   matrotrophic nutrition. When the embryos reach 40-55 mm, placental
   development begins with the vascularization of the yolk sac where it
   contacts the uterine wall. Implantation occurs at an age of 8-10 weeks by
   which time the embryos reach 70-85 mm. The expanding yolk sac engulfs the
   maternal placental villi, and its surface interdigitates with the villi
   to form the placenta. The rest of the lumenal surface of the uterus is
   covered by non-placental villi that appear shortly after implantation.
   Histotrophe production by the non-placental villi begins just after their
   formation. The placenta grows continuously during gestation. The egg
   envelope is present throughout gestation, separating maternal and fetal
   tissues. Embryos develop numerous appendiculae on the umbilical cord.

   (fresh shrimp extract) was monitored in a tank (5×5×0.5 m) by means of a
   square matrix of 1936 photocells embedded in the floor and an on line
   computer. The experiments were done in flowing (1.17 cm/s) and stagnant
   water in order to determine the effects of flow on the accuracy of
   localization and to clarify some of the locomotor mechanisms involved.
   The response was quantified by a temporal and spatial analysis of
   activity, distance travelled, mean velocity, mean turn size, step length
   between turns and its direction vector, frequency of turning, the time
   spent by the animal in the quadrants of the tank, the mean direction
   vector of the steps and computer plots of locomotor pathways. For
   controls, the locomotion was monitored in the absence of chemical
   stimulation and with a placebo (seawater) replacing the shrimp extract.
   Five animals were used in 22 experiments in flowing, 20 in stagnant
   water. The relationship between each of the above-mentioned locomotor
   variables and the position of the discrete source of stimulation was
   examined by regression analyses and compared quantitatively between
   flowing and stagnant water. Localization is very precise in flowing water
   and is dependent on the gradient of the stimulus in the medium.
   Downstream sites of stimulation are better localized than upstream ones.
   In stagnant water only generalized localization occurs. The flowing water
   provides the direction vector for precise localization.

   low lifetime fecundity that is heavily fished in the western North

   pups and the principal nurseries are in the mid-Atlantic region. We
   calculated effective number of breeders (Nb) and effective population
   size (Ne) for adults utilizing the nursery grounds of the Delaware Bay
   and the Eastern Shore of Virginia by genotyping 902 animals across five
   cohorts at eight microsatellite loci. Estimates of Nb and Ne were
   compared to estimates of census size (Nc) of cohorts obtained from
   Delaware Bay. The estimated Ne/Nc and Nb/Nc ratios were 0.45 or higher
   whether the Delaware Bay cohorts were considered as distinct year classes
   or combined. This is in contrast to estimated Ne/Nc ratios in other
   exploited marine fishes, which are several orders of magnitude smaller.
   Instead, the Ne/Nc ratio of sandbar sharks is similar to that found in
   marine and terrestrial mammals.

AB Abstract A light stimulus, focused on the head of the dogfish shark (
   Scyliorhinus caniculus ) over the end vesicle of the epiphysis cerebri
   (pineal organ), elicits a positive slow wave accompanied by inhibition of
   spike activity which was recorded from the cut end of the epiphyseal
   stalk. A stimulus of4.3 × 10 −4 lm/m 2 was sufficient to alter the
   on-going neural activity. From threshold to approximately 3 log units
   above threshold, there was good correlation between the amplitude of the
   slow potential and the inhibition of spikes. Further increases in the
   intensity of the stimulus did not elicit larger positive waves but
   greatly prolonged the duration of the inhibition of spikes. The
   observations can be best interpreted if the slow potentials arise from
   the ganglion cells and represent the summated inhibitory postsynaptic
   potentials transmitted electronically to the recording electrode. The
   spectral sensitivity of the epiphysis and the lateral eyes peak at 500
   nm.

   and illustrated. These displays are reviewed in terms of ethological
   concepts and shark hydrodynamic models. Shark agonistic displays feature
   many common elements rendering them readily distinguishable from normal
   swimming and pseudodisplays caused by sharksucker irritation. Shark
   agonistic displays are most readily elicited by rapid, direct diver
   approach when food is absent and potential escape routes restricted. Such
   displays appear to be motivated by defence of self or the immediately
   surrounding space rather than defence of territory or resources. Costs
   and benefits of display versus attack in shark–shark and shark–diver
   contests are evaluated using payoff matrices and optimal strategies are

   nested critical approach distances. For divers faced with a displaying

AB Abstract The nurse shark ( Ginglymostoma cirratum ) is a common resident
   of Florida and Caribbean waters. In spite of its prevalence, details of
   nurse shark life history and ecology are not well known. Ongoing studies
   have identified a population that undergoes mating and parturition in one
   specific site in the Florida Keys. Our tagging, observation, and filming
   have demonstrated that reproductive activities occur preferentially for
   some animals in very shallow coastal waters, and one such site became the
   study area. From our continuing investigations we have learned that
   mating activities of the sharks in this area are vulnerable to the
   disruptive effects of wading, diving, photography (electronic flash),
   boat traffic, and human presence during the times when mating occurs. To
   reduce disruptive activities during the mating season, a proposal to
   protect this mating and nursery grounds was submitted to the National
   Park Service. Three elements of protection that we felt were critical to
   implement were to: (1) recognize a specific area as unique and critical
   to the breeding success of the sharks, (2) restrict the public during
   times identified by our research as essential for mating, and (3)
   implement a program of public education.

AB Age and growth of the whiskery shark, Furgaleus macki, from southwestern
   Australia were examined using vertebral ageing and tag-recapture data.
   The readability of bands on the vertebral centra varied markedly between
   individuals. Four readers were used to make band counts, with the most
   experienced reader having the lowest ‘index of average percent error’ and
   the highest level of agreement with final counts. Marginal increment
   analysis indicated that opaque bands form in January. With parturition
   occurring from August to October, size data suggests that the first band
   is probably formed 15–17 months after birth. The age at maturity was
   estimated to be 4.5 years for males, and 6.5 years for females. The
   oldest male was 10.5 years, and oldest female was 11.5 years. Von
   Bertalanffy growth parameters for males were L∞=121.5 cm fork length,
   K=0.423 year−1, t0=−0.472 years, were L∞=120.7 cm fork length, K=0.369
   year−1, t0=−0.544 years for females, and were L∞=118.1 cm fork length,
   K=0.420 year−1, t0=−0.491 years for combined sexes. Data from a tag
   recapture study were analysed using a maximum likelihood method to verify
   the estimates of growth parameters from vertebral ageing. Von Bertalanffy
   growth parameters from the tag recapture study were L∞=128.2 cm fork
   length, K=0.288 year−1, t0=−0.654 years. The two methods of estimating
   growth parameters produced similar results, with rapid growth until
   approximately 5 years of age, after which there was little increase in
   length.

AB Advances in recombinant antibody technology and protein engineering have
   provided the opportunity to reduce antibodies to their smallest binding
   domain components and have concomitantly driven the requirement for
   devising strategies to increase serum half-life to optimise drug
   exposure, thereby increasing therapeutic efficacy. In this study, we
   adopted an immunization route to raise picomolar affinity shark
   immunoglobulin new antigen receptors (IgNARs) to target human serum
   albumin (HSA). From our model shark species, Squalus acanthias, a phage
   display library encompassing the variable binding domain of IgNAR (VNAR)
   was constructed, screened against target, and positive clones were
   characterized for affinity and specificity. N-terminal and C-terminal
   molecular fusions of our lead hit in complex with a naive VNAR domain
   were expressed, purified and exhibited the retention of high affinity
   binding to HSA, but also cross-selectivity to mouse, rat and monkey serum
   albumin both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, the naive VNAR had
   enhanced pharmacokinetic (PK) characteristics in both N- and C-terminal
   orientations and when tested as a three domain construct with naive VNAR
   flanking the HSA binding domain at both the N and C termini. Molecules
   derived from this platform technology also demonstrated the potential for
   clinical utility by being available via the subcutaneous route of
   delivery. This study thus demonstrates the first in vivo functional
   efficacy of a VNAR binding domain with the ability to enhance PK
   properties and support delivery of multifunctional therapies.

AB The epaulette shark (Hemiscyllium ocellatum) is among the few vertebrates
   that can tolerate extreme hypoxia for prolonged periods and, as shown
   here, anoxia. We examined how anoxia affected this shark's level of
   responsiveness, concentration of brain ATP and adenosine — an endogenous
   neuronal depressant. In addition, we investigated how these variables
   were affected by aminophylline, an adenosine receptor antagonist.
   Epaulette sharks placed in an anoxic environment (<0.02 mg O2 l−1) lost
   their righting reflex after 46.3±2.8 min, but immediately regained
   vigilance upon return to normoxia. Then 24 h later, the same sharks were
   injected with either saline or aminophylline (30 mg kg−1) in saline and
   re-exposed to anoxia. In this second anoxic episode, controls sharks
   showed a 56% decrease in the time taken to lose their righting reflex but
   maintained their brain ATP levels; conversely, aminophylline-treated
   epaulette sharks displayed a 46% increase in the time to loss of righting
   reflex and had significantly lower brain ATP levels. Since anoxia also
   caused a 3.5-fold increase in brain adenosine levels, these results
   suggest that adenosine receptor activation had a pre-emptive role in
   maintaining brain ATP levels during anoxia. Perhaps because adenosine
   receptor activation initiates metabolic depression, indicated by the
   early loss of responsiveness (righting reflex), such a mechanism would
   serve to reduce ATP consumption and maintain brain ATP levels.

AB The oxygen and strontium isotopic composition of 125 teeth of the

   (Rhaetian) bone bed localities in the Central European Basin are used as
   environmental and ecological tracers for the shallow epicontinental
   Rhaetian Sea. The preservation of tooth enameloid was ascertained by
   cathodoluminescence microscopy. Mean δ18OP values differ regionally
   across the Rhaetian Sea with values of 18.6 ± 0.6‰ near the western gate,
   16.1 ± 0.8‰ in the east, 15.4 ± 0.6‰ in the southeast, and 17.7 ± 0.9‰ in
   the south. The δ18OP values in the eastern Rhaetian Sea are 4–5‰ lower
   relative to Tethyan seawater, while teeth from the southern and western
   parts close to the marine gates are less fractionated. The strontium
   isotopic composition of teeth from most localities is more radiogenic in
   comparison to late Triassic seawater. The observed spatial δ18OP trend in
   the Rhaetian Sea indicates a shift from marine to brackish conditions in
   the south and west towards extensively brackish conditions with
   salinities of less than 16‰ in the east, thus confirming the existence of
   two marine gates. Brackish conditions persisted throughout early Rhaetian
   times, and were maintained by increased fluvial discharge from the
   Vindelician–Bohemian and Fennoscandian Highs as a result of enhanced
   atmospheric moisture availability in the course of the Rhaetian
   transgression. The δ18OP values of Lissodus and Hybodus indicate
   euryhaline behaviour of Rhaetian hybodonts by exceeding modern shark
   intraspecific variability. The lack of accordance in δ18OP values between
   different isotopically conspicuous localities in the Rhaetian Sea
   contradicts a basin-wide migration pattern. Differences between co-site
   taxa might indicate some degree of niche partitioning.

AB The paleobiology of the Cretaceous neoselachian shark,Squalicorax, has

   complete skeletons of three species ofSqualicorax, S. falcatus
   (Aoassiz),S. kaupi (Agassiz), andS. pristodontus (Agassiz), that were
   collected from the U.S.A. These specimens suggest that the total body
   length (TL) ofS. falcatus typically measured 1.8–2.0 m, and probably did
   not exceed 3 m. Moderatesized individuals ofS. kaupi andS. pristodontus
   perhaps measured about 3 m TL. AlthoughS. pristodontus was the largest
   form among the three species examined, this taxon possessed a set of
   large jaws (with large but fewer teeth) relative to its body size
   compared toS. falcatus orS. kaupi. This suggests that tooth size is not
   an accurate indicator of the TL if one compares oneSqualicorax species to
   another. Neurocranial features suggest that the vision ofSqualicorax was
   not as acute as that of a contemporaneous macrophagous lamniform
   shark,Cretoxyrhina mantelli (Agassiz) , but olfaction ofSqualicorax may
   have been better thanC. mantelli. The morphology of placoid scales
   suggests thatSqualicorax was capable of fast swimming. New skeletal data
   support the view that the feeding dynamics ofSqualicorax was similar to
   the modern tiger shark (Galeocerdo Muller & Henle). The present data do
   not allow for exact ordinal placement, but, contrary to some previous
   interpretations,Squalicorax can be excluded from the Hexanchiformes and
   Orectolobiformes. The taxon should more appropriately be placed within
   the Lamniformes or Carcharhiniformes.

AB Mesh netting of beaches along the more populous sections of the NSW coast
   for the protection of swimmers and surfers against shark attack has been
   carried out since 1937 in Sydney and since 1949 in Newcastle and
   Wollongong. Data for the catches of sharks by taxonomic groups are
   presented for the period from 1950 to 1990. Although there were large
   year-to-year fluctuations, neither catch nor catch per unit effort showed
   any discernible trend for the period up to 1972. In 1973, the catches of
   all taxonomic groups increased substantially following changes to the
   specifications of nets and their deployment. Since 1974, there has been a
   continuing decline in both the numbers of sharks caught and the catch per
   unit effort. Although Carcharhinus spp. (whalers) and Carcharodon
   carcharias (white pointer sharks) have shown an almost unbroken decline
   since the commencement of meshing, Sphyrna spp. (hammerheads) and
   Squatina australis (angel sharks) have shown large fluctuations over the
   entire study period, particularly in the period following the upgrading
   of netting effectiveness (post-1973). Substantial changes have occurred
   in the size compositions of a number of the taxonomic groups between the
   first and second 20-year periods of the meshing programme. High
   proportions of S. Australis and Carcharias taurus (grey nurse sharks)
   were females. There were major differences in the species compositions of
   catches between the three major meshing areas and between the pre- and
   post- 1973 periods. Data on the catches of nontarget species for the

AB The majority of studies on the evolution and function of feeding in
   sharks have focused primarily on the movement of cranial components and
   muscle function, with little integration of tooth properties or function.
   As teeth are subjected to sometimes extreme loads during feeding, they
   undergo stress, strain, and potential failure. As attributes related to
   structural strength such as material properties and overall shape may be
   subjected to natural selection, both prey processing ability and
   structural parameters must be considered to understand the evolution of
   shark teeth. In this study, finite element analysis was used to visualize
   stress distributions of fossil and extant shark teeth during puncture,
   unidirectional draw (cutting), and holding. Under the loading and
   boundary conditions here, which are consistent with bite forces of large
   sharks, shark teeth are structurally strong. Teeth loaded in puncture
   have localized stress concentrations at the cusp apex that diminish
   rapidly away from the apex. When loaded in draw and holding, the majority
   of the teeth show stress concentrations consistent with well designed
   cantilever beams. Notches result in stress concentration during draw and
   may serve as a weak point; however they are functionally important for
   cutting prey during lateral head shaking behavior. As shark teeth are
   replaced regularly, it is proposed that the frequency of tooth
   replacement in sharks is driven by tooth wear, not tooth failure. As the
   tooth tip and cutting edges are worn, the surface areas of these features
   increase, decreasing the amount of stress produced by the tooth. While
   this wear will not affect the general structural strength of the tooth,
   tooth replacement may also serve to keep ahead of damage caused by
   fatigue that may lead to eventual tooth failure. J. Morphol., 2011. ©

AB A peptide with relaxin activity in guinea pigs but not in mice has been
   extracted from the ovaries of pregnant sand tiger sharks (Odontaspis

   includes molecular size (∼6000 daltons), number of chains, and, possibly,
   disulfide cross-links. The relaxin-type peptide isolated from shark
   ovaries contains the amino acid residues tyrosine, proline, and
   histidine, which are absent in the porcine hormone. The amino acid
   composition of shark relaxin, therefore, resembles that of porcine
   insulin to a greater extent than does the amino acid composition of
   porcine relaxin. This finding supports the idea that shark relaxin may be
   a primitive relaxin that has undergone fewer mutations than porcine
   relaxin since the putative duplication of the insulin gene. The data
   presented here suggest that the putative duplication of the insulin gene,
   which might have given rise to relaxin, has occurred much earlier than

AB At small spatial scales basking sharks (Cetorhinus maximus) forage
   selectively on zooplankton along thermal fronts, but the factors
   influencing broader scale patterns in their abundance and distribution
   remain largely unknown. Using long-term sightings data collected off
   southwest Britain between 1988 and 2001, we show that the number of
   basking sharks recorded was highly correlated with abiotic factors,
   principally sea surface temperature (SST) and the lagged effect of SST in
   the previous month, but only very weakly to zooplankton density. This
   suggests that the changes in number of basking sharks recorded over large
   spatio-temporal scales are more closely related to the availability of
   climatedriven thermal resources than prey availability, whereas the
   converse is supported by previous studies at local scales. Taken
   together, these results imply scale-dependent behavioural responses in
   basking sharks, with small-scale foraging movements linked by broad scale
   responses to temperature variation.

AB Previous studies of the effects of C-type natriuretic peptides (CNP) in

   vascular smooth muscle (VSM) from various fish species, utilizing either
   mammalian or non-homologous fish atrial natriuretic peptides (ANP), have
   demonstrated vasodilation with a relatively high sensitivity (EC50 ∼ 5
   nM). The recent sequencing of a C-type natriuretic peptide from the heart
   of the dogfish shark, Squalus acanthias, has enabled us to compare the
   efficacy of this peptide on aortic VSM from that species with two other
   CNPs (from killifish and pig), as well as rat ANP. The EC50 of dilation
   for sCNP, as well as kCNP and pCNP, was 0.5 nM, over 15 times lower than
   the EC50 of the response to rANP. These data suggest that CNP is released
   from the dogfish shark heart and is a circulating hormone with potent
   vasodilatory effects, in sharp contrast to the apparent role of CNP
   predominantly as a brain neuropeptide in mammals. © 1993 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB Remains of parasites in vertebrates are rare from the Mesozoic and
   Paleozoic. Once most parasites that live in – or pass through – the
   gastrointestinal tract of vertebrates, fossil feces (coprolites) or even
   intestinal contents (enterolites) can eventually preserve their remains.
   Here we announce the discovery of a spiral shark coprolite from the
   Paleozoic bearing a cluster of 93 small oval-elliptical smooth-shelled
   structures, interpreted as eggs of a tapeworm.The eggs were found in a
   thin section of an elasmobranch coprolite. Most of the eggs are filled by
   pyrite and some have a special polar swelling (operculum), suggesting
   they are non-erupted eggs. One of the eggs contains a probable developing
   larva. The eggs are approximately 145–155 µm in length and 88–100 µm in
   width and vary little in size within the cluster. The depositional and
   morphological features of the eggs closely resemble those of cestodes.
   Not only do the individual eggs have features of extant tapeworms, but
   their deposition all together in an elongate segment is typical to modern
   tapeworm eggs deposited in mature segments (proglottids). This is the
   earliest fossil record of tapeworm parasitism of vertebrates and
   establishes a timeline for the evolution of cestodes. This discovery
   shows that the fossil record of vertebrate intestinal parasites is much
   older than was hitherto known and that the interaction between tapeworms
   and vertebrates occurred at least since the Middle-Late Permian.

AB : Sex-biased dispersal is expected to homogenize nuclear genetic
   variation relative to variation in genetic material inherited through the
   philopatric sex. When site fidelity occurs across a heterogeneous
   environment, local selective regimes may alter this pattern. We assessed
   spatial patterns of variation in nuclear-encoded, single nucleotide
   polymorphisms (SNPs) and sequences of the mitochondrial control region in
   bonnethead sharks (Sphyrna tiburo), a species thought to exhibit female
   philopatry, collected from summer habitats used for gestation. Geographic
   patterns of mtDNA haplotypes and putatively neutral SNPs confirmed female
   philopatry and male-mediated gene flow along the northeastern coast of
   the Gulf of Mexico. A total of 30 outlier SNP loci were identified;
   alleles at over half of these loci exhibited signatures of
   latitude-associated selection. Our results indicate that in species with
   sex-biased dispersal, philopatry can facilitate sorting of locally
   adaptive variation, with the dispersing sex facilitating movement of
   potentially adaptive variation among locations and environments.

AB Sharks are charismatic predators that play a key role in most marine food
   webs. Their demonstrated vulnerability to exploitation has recently
   turned them into flagship species in ocean conservation. Yet, the
   assessment and monitoring of the distribution and abundance of such
   mobile species in marine environments remain challenging, often invasive
   and resource-intensive. Here we pilot a novel, rapid and non-invasive
   environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding approach specifically targeted to
   infer shark presence, diversity and eDNA read abundance in tropical
   habitats. We identified at least 21 shark species, from both Caribbean
   and Pacific Coral Sea water samples, whose geographical patterns of
   diversity and read abundance coincide with geographical differences in
   levels of anthropogenic pressure and conservation effort. We demonstrate
   that eDNA metabarcoding can be effectively employed to study shark
   diversity. Further developments in this field have the potential to
   drastically enhance our ability to assess and monitor elusive oceanic
   predators, and lead to improved conservation strategies.

AB Abstract To date, the majority of studies on feeding mechanics in sharks
   have focused on the movement of cranial components and muscle function,
   with little attention to tooth properties or function. Attributes related
   to mechanical properties, such as structural strength, may also be
   subjected to natural selection. Additionally it is necessary to
   characterize these properties in order to construct biomechanical models
   of tooth function. The goal of this study was to determine hardness and
   elastic modulus for the shark tooth materials enameloid, osteodentine,
   and orthodentine. Five teeth each from one carcharhiniform species, the
   bonnethead Sphyrna tiburo, and one lamniform, the sand tiger shark
   Carcharias taurus, were utilized for nanoindentation testing. Each tooth
   was sectioned transversely, air-dried, and polished. Both enameloid and
   dentine were tested on each tooth via a Berkovich diamond tip, with nine
   2 μm deep indentations per material. t-Tests were used to determine if
   there were differences in hardness and Young's modulus between the tooth
   materials of the two species. There was no significant difference between
   the two species for the material properties of enameloid, however both
   hardness and Young's modulus were higher for osteodentine than for
   orthodentine. This may be due to differences in microanatomy and chemical
   composition, however this needs to be studied in greater detail.

AB OBJECTIVE: We describe the pharmacological properties of a novel
   spermine-cholesterol adduct, MSI 1436 (3β-N-1(spermine)-7α,
   24R-dihydroxy-5α-cholestane 24-sulfate), which causes reversible
   suppression of food and fluid intake in mammals resulting in profound
   weight loss, not associated with other signs or symptoms of illness, and
   which exhibits antidiabetic properties in genetically obese mice.
   METHODS: Wild-type rodents and strains with genetic obesity were studied.
   Effects on food and fluid intake, body weight and composition were
   examined along with pharmacological and toxicological parameters.
   RESULTS: MSI-1436 induces profound inhibition of food and fluid intake in
   rats and mice, resulting in significant weight loss. MSI-1436 is active
   when introduced directly into the third ventricle of the rat, suggesting
   the compound acts on central targets. Pair-feeding studies suggest that
   MSI-1436 causes weight loss by suppressing food intake. Fluid intake is
   also profoundly reduced but animals remain normally hydrated and defend
   both water and electrolyte balance from parenteral administration.
   MSI-1436 is active in ob/ob, db/db, agouti and MC4 receptor knockout
   mice. MSI-1436 has been administered to ob/ob mice over a 4 month period
   via a regimen that safely controls body weight, glucose homeostasis and
   serum cholesterol levels. Following MSI-1436 treatment, db/db mice
   preferentially mobilize adipose tissue and hyperglycemia is corrected.
   CONCLUSION: A naturally occurring spermine metabolite of cholesterol,
   isolated from the dogfish shark, Squalus acanthias, has been identified
   that induces profound reduction in food and fluid intake in rodents in a
   setting where thirst is preserved and fluid and electrolyte homeostasis
   appears to be functioning normally. MSI-1436 probably acts on a central
   target involving neural circuits that lie downstream from the leptin and
   the MC4 receptors. Although long-term administration can be accomplished
   safely in mice, the utility of this compound as a potential human
   therapeutic awaits an analysis of its pharmacological properties in man.

AB Background Sharks (Selachi) are among the largest predators in deep and
   shallow seas, feeding on live and dead prey. Olfaction is one of the
   central senses by which they forage, especially at night and in deep
   water. The organs responsible for this function are the olfactory
   rosettes, which are situated in their nares. This study follows the
   ontogenesis and cytological development of the olfactory rosettes of the
   Oman shark, Iago omanensis, found in the Gulf of Aqaba, Red Sea, at
   depths of 150-1500 m. Methods The sharks were collected bimonthly by
   means of a specially designed vertical standing net and sacrificed by an
   overdose of MS222. The olfactory rosettes were extracted from the adults
   and embryos, then fixed and prepared for EM and LM studies. Results Iago
   is a placental, matrotrophic species with a maximal dimension of 800 mm
   TL (total length). It reproduces all year round, giving birth to a
   maximum of four (occasionally five) young of 170-180 mm TL. In newborn
   and adult fish the nasal olfactory organs are as described for other
   sharks, composed of olfactory lamellae with secondary folds. The number
   of lamellae increases during embryogenesis up to a maximum of 28-32 in
   adults. The primary nasal placodes first appear in larvae of 10-14 mm on
   the dorso-lateral part of the head and then become gradually displaced to
   the ventral position, typical for adults. Ontogenesis of the nasal
   rosettes is characterized by a gradual development of the lamellae and
   their secondary folds, with a concomitant ripening of the sensory
   elements (ciliated, microvillar, and rod-like bearing cells), as well as
   glandular and supporting cells and cells containing kinocilia that
   agitate the nasal water flow. Conclusions The released young possess
   functional olfactory organs and developed neural transmission across the
   olfactory bulb and tract, to the olfactory lobes in the brain, enabling
   them to forage from birth. Presented data show the occurrence in I.
   omanensis of two types of ciliated and microvillar cells. Ciliated and
   rod-bearing sensory neurons are described for the first time in sharks.

AB The growth rates and patterns of stromatolites are of interest in that
   fine‐scale laminations in some Precambrian examples have been interpreted
   as daily growth layers whose orientations reflect the annual transit of
   the sun. By contrast, the modern and Holocene stromatolites at Shark Bay
   occur in a high‐energy environment where accumulation and growth only
   marginally exceed erosion. Long‐term vertical growth rates of ≤0.4
   mm/year were determined by radiocarbon dating and supported by
   uranium‐series methods. These rates are up to 250 times slower than those
   growth rates estimated from the laminae patterns of some Precambrian
   stromatolites. Thus, daily bands are not recognized and individual
   subtidal stromatolite columns from Shark Bay take up to 1000 years to
   reach their present heights of ∼ 350 mm. The earliest exposed
   stromatolites at Shark Bay grew during the interval 1250–1000 years ago
   and are now dead and stranded (in response to falling relative sea level)

AB The reproductive biology of the smooth-hound shark Mustelus mustelus was
   studied in the Gulf of Gabes (southern Tunisia). Females were found to
   mature between 1075 and 1230 mm total length (LT) whereas males matured
   between 880 and 1120 mm LT. The LT at which 50% of the population reached
   maturity was 971 and 1172 mm for males and females, respectively. Male
   gonads were symmetrical in terms of mass and both functional, whereas in
   females only the right ovary was functional. The seasonal changes in the
   oocytes and testes development, embryo length and the occurrence of
   near-term and post-partum females showed that this species displayed a
   clearly defined annual reproductive cycle with parturition occurring
   during late April and early May, after a gestation period of 10–11
   months. Mating took place during May and early June and fertilization
   occurred from early June to early July. The embryo sex ratio was not
   significantly different from unity. Litter size varied from four to 18
   embryos and was positively correlated with maternal LT. The young were
   born with a LT of 340–420 mm.

AB 1.The whale shark (Rhincodon typus) is a popular focal species within the
   global marine tourism industry. Although this has contributed to
   increased protection being granted to the species in several countries,
   tourism itself can be detrimental to the sharks in the absence of
   appropriate management. Potential impacts can be mitigated, at least in
   the short term, by adherence to well-designed interaction guidelines. 2.A
   burgeoning marine tourism industry based on swimming with whale sharks
   has developed at Tofo Beach in Mozambique. However, no formal management
   is currently in place at this site. 3.The behaviour of whale sharks
   during interactions with boats and swimmers were recorded during 137
   commercial snorkelling trips run from Tofo Beach over a 20 month period.
   Whale sharks were encountered on 87% of trips, which operated year-round.
   4.Boat proximity and shark size were significant predictors of avoidance
   behaviour. No avoidance responses were recorded at >20 m boat distance.
   5.The mean in-water interaction time between sharks and swimmers was 8
   min 48 s overall. There was a significant decrease in interaction times
   during encounters where sharks expressed avoidance behaviours, and also
   in cases where sharks had expressed boat avoidance behaviour before
   swimmers entered the water. 6.It is suggested that mean encounter times
   can be extended through adherence to a basic Code of Conduct for
   operators and swimmers that enforces minimum distances between the
   sharks, boats and swimmers. Using encounter time as a measure of the
   ‘success’ of interactions holds promise, as longer encounters appear to
   be indicative of lower impacts on sharks while also providing higher
   customer satisfaction for swimmers. Copyright © 2010 John Wiley & Sons,

AB Whale shark Rhincodon typus is a globally distributed species, but there
   is a lack of knowledge pertaining to their biology, seasonal occurrence,
   and distribution in the northern Gulf of Mexico (NGOM). Understanding
   critical habitat for whale sharks is essential on both a regional and
   global basis for proper management because of their large migratory
   range. The goal of the present study was to describe the regional
   distribution of whale shark feeding aggregations in the NGOM by
   exploiting a presence-only dataset collected as a part of a volunteer
   sighting survey. Whale shark aggregations have been documented in large
   numbers in the NGOM since 2003, and species distribution models provide a
   unique approach to analyzing these presence data. We used maximum entropy
   and ecological niche factor analysis, 2 algorithms designed for
   predicting spe- cies distribution based only on presence data, to analyze
   data for the summer period in 2008 and 2009. Cohen's kappa (kappa) and
   the 'area under the receiver operating characteristic curve' (AUC) were
   used to evaluate model performance with an external testing dataset.
   Kappa values ranged from 0.28 to 0.69, and AUC values ranged from 0.73 to
   0.80, indicating that the predicted distribution had a fair to
   substantial agreement with the testing data. Distance to continental
   shelf edge, distance to adjacent petroleum platforms, and chlorophyll a
   were the variables most strongly related to whale shark sightings, likely
   due to an association of these variables with high food availability.
   Suitable habitat was predicted along the continental shelf edge, with the
   most suitable habitat predicted south of the Mississippi River Delta. The
   spatial distribution of suitable habitat is dynamic; therefore, a
   multi-year study is underway to better delineate temporal trends in
   regional whale shark distribution and to identify consistent areas of
   high suitability. Presence- only habitat models are a powerful tool for
   delineating important regional habitat for a vulnerable, highly migratory
   species.

   (Hirayama, 1995). The group includes two gigantic forms, Archelon Wieland
   and Protostega Cope, that reached maximum carapace lengths in excess of 2
   m and rank among the largest turtles that ever lived. In this paper, we
   describe two specimens of Protostega gigas Cope housed in the Field

   PR58. Both are from the Mooreville Chalk (Upper Santonian to Lower
   Campanian: Mancini et al., 1995) in Greene County, Alabama, and are
   noteworthy because they show tooth marks from at least one large shark.
   One of the specimens also exhibits five embedded teeth of the Late

AB Alterations in predation pressure can have large effects on
   trophically-structured systems. Modification of predator behaviour via
   ocean warming has been assessed by laboratory experimentation and
   metabolic theory. However, the influence of ocean acidification with
   ocean warming remains largely unexplored for mesopredators, including
   experimental assessments that incorporate key components of the
   assemblages in which animals naturally live. We employ a combination of
   long-term laboratory and mesocosm experiments containing natural prey and
   habitat to assess how warming and acidification affect the development,
   growth, and hunting behaviour in sharks. Although embryonic development
   was faster due to temperature, elevated temperature and CO2 had
   detrimental effects on sharks by not only increasing energetic demands,
   but also by decreasing metabolic efficiency and reducing their ability to
   locate food through olfaction. The combination of these effects led to
   considerable reductions in growth rates of sharks held in natural
   mesocosms with elevated CO2, either alone or in combination with higher
   temperature. Our results suggest a more complex reality for predators,
   where ocean acidification reduces their ability to effectively hunt and
   exert strong top-down control over food webs.

AB Abstract Microbial deposits at Shark Bay, Australia constitute one of the
   largest and most diverse modern occurrences around the world. The
   microbial carbonate system has developed in response to environmental
   change from near open marine into restricted embayment with hypersalinity
   and high evaporation. Bacterial sediments started depositing at about
   2000 years BP, after the Holocene maximum flooding of sea level about
   6800 years BP, due to increasing salinity as the sea level fell by about
   2.5 m, within the Holocene highstand system tract. The extent and types
   of subtidal microbial substrate in this World Heritage area have not
   previously been fully systematically mapped and described. Here we
   document the importance of subtidal microbial deposits occupying as much
   as 10 times the occurrence area of the intertidal microbial mats and
   stromatolites and demonstrate that deeper structures have a cerebroid
   external morphology with a non laminated internal fabric. Subtidal
   structures contain consistently different internal fabrics with carbonate
   grains and fragments interbedded with aragonitic micrite arranged in
   millimetric laminae or sub-spherical patches, which display fabrics such
   as well laminated (Smooth), coarse laminated wavy (Colloform),
   sub-laminar to irregular with voids and biofragments of bivalves
   (Microbial Pavement), irregular clotted (Pustular) and non-laminated
   (Cerebroid), constituting carbonate sediment with stromatolitic facies
   (Smooth and Colloform), thrombolitic facies (Pustular) and
   cryptomicrobial non-laminated (Cerebroid and Microbial Pavement). Each
   microbial structure grows in specific settings according to water depth
   (MSL), with Cerebroid build-ups commonly occurring between − 1 and − 2.5
   m and Microbial Pavement extending as deep as 6 m. Because of the late
   Holocene sea level fall microbial structures often record in their
   internal features a shallowing-up carbonate cycle. These newly documented
   extensive subtidal microbial structures, with distinctive morphologies
   and fabrics have importance as modern occurrences and provide potential
   analogues for understanding ancient microbial systems and environments.

AB Abstract Members of the genus Ebolavirus cause fulminating outbreaks of
   disease in human and non-human primate populations with a mortality rate
   up to 90%. To facilitate rapid detection of these pathogens in clinical
   and environmental samples, robust reagents capable of providing sensitive
   and specific detection are required. In this work recombinant antibody
   libraries were generated from murine (single chain variable domain
   fragment; scFv) and nurse shark, Ginglymostoma cirratum (IgNAR V) hosts
   immunised with Zaire ebolavirus . This provides the first recorded IgNAR
   V response against a particulate antigen in the nurse shark. Both murine
   scFv and shark IgNAR V libraries were panned by phage display technology
   to identify useful antibodies for the generation of immunological
   detection reagents. Two murine scFv were shown to have specificity to the
   Zaire ebolavirus viral matrix protein VP40. Two isolated IgNAR V were
   shown to bind to the viral nucleoprotein (NP) and to capture viable Zaire
   ebolavirus with a high degree of sensitivity. Assays developed with IgNAR
   V cross-reacted to Reston ebolavirus , Sudan ebolavirus and Bundibugyo
   ebolavirus . Despite this broad reactivity, neither of IgNAR V showed
   reactivity to Cote d’Ivoire ebolavirus . IgNAR V was substantially more
   resistant to irreversible thermal denaturation than murine scFv and
   monoclonal IgG in a comparative test. The demonstrable robustness of the
   IgNAR V domains may offer enhanced utility as immunological detection
   reagents in fieldable biosensor applications for use in tropical or
   subtropical countries where outbreaks of Ebolavirus haemorrhagic fever
   occur.

AB Aim: Most reef fishes are site-attached, but can maintain a broad
   distribution through their highly dispersive larval stage. The whitetip
   reef shark (Triaenodon obesus) is site-attached, yet maintains the
   largest Indo-Pacific distribution of any reef shark while lacking the
   larval stage of bony (teleost) fishes. Here we use mitochondrial DNA
   (mtDNA) sequence data to evaluate the enigma of the sedentary reef shark
   that maintains a distribution across two-thirds of the planet. Location:
   Tropical Pacific and Indian Oceans. Methods: We analysed 1025 base pairs
   of the mtDNA control region in 310 individuals from 25 locations across
   the Indian and Pacific Oceans. Phylogeographic and population genetic
   analyses were used to reveal the dispersal and recent evolutionary
   history of the species. Results: We resolved 15 mtDNA control region
   haplotypes, but two comprised 87% of the specimens and were detected at
   nearly every location. Similar to other sharks, genetic diversity was low
   (h = 0.550 ± 0.0254 and π = 0.00213 ± 0.00131). Spatial analyses of
   genetic variation demonstrated strong isolation across the Indo-Pacific
   Barrier and between western and central Pacific locations. Pairwise ΦST
   comparisons indicated high connectivity among archipelagos of the central
   Pacific but isolation across short distances of contiguous habitat (Great
   Barrier Reef) and intermittent habitat (Hawaiian Archipelago). In the
   eastern Pacific only a single haplotype (the most common one in the
   central Pacific) was observed, indicating recent dispersal (or
   colonization) across the East Pacific Barrier. Main conclusions: The
   shallow haplotype network indicates recent expansion of modern
   populations within the last half million years from a common ancestor.
   Based on the distribution of mtDNA diversity, this began with an
   Indo-West Pacific centre of origin, with subsequent dispersal to the
   Central Pacific and East Pacific. Genetic differences between Indian and
   Pacific Ocean populations are consistent with Pleistocene closures of the
   Indo-Pacific Barrier associated with glacial cycles. Pairwise population
   comparisons reveal weak but significant isolation by distance, and
   notably do not indicate the high coastal connectivity observed in other
   shark species. The finding of population structure among semi-contiguous
   habitats, but population connectivity among archipelagos, may indicate a
   previously unsuspected oceanic dispersal behaviour in whitetip reef
   sharks.

AB Bite force, a measure of performance, can be used to link anatomical form
   and function. Earlier studies have shown bite force to have a significant
   influence on dietary constraints and ontogenetic shifts in resource
   utilization. The bonnethead shark, Sphyrna tiburo ,i s a durophagous
   member of the family Sphyrnidae. Its diet in South Florida waters
   consists almost entirely of blue crabs, which are crushed or ingested
   whole. This abundant coastal predator's feeding mechanism is specialized
   for the consumption of hard prey, including a modified biting pattern and
   molariform teeth. The goals of this research were to (1) characterize the
   mechanical function of the feeding mechanism of S. tiburo through
   biomechanical modeling of biting and in vivo bite force measurements; (2)
   compare the bite force of S. tiburo with those of other fishes; and (3)
   identify functional constraints on prey capture by comparing the bite
   force of S. tiburo with the fracture properties of its primary prey item,
   blue crabs. Maximum theoretical bite force ranged from 25.7N anteriorly
   to 107.9N posteriorly. S. tiburo has the second lowest mass specific bite
   force for any fish studied to date, and its posterior mechanical
   advantage of 0.88 is lower than other durophagous chondrichthyans,
   indicating that this independent evolutionary acquisition of durophagy
   was not accompanied by the associated morphological changes found in
   other durophagous cartilaginous fishes. Blue crab fracture forces
   (30.0-490.0N) range well above the maximum bite force of S. tiburo,
   suggesting that prey material properties functionally constrain dietary
   ecology to some degree. J. Exp. Zool. 311A, 2009. r 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

   size and structure. We collected 11,681 photographs of which only 1,149
   were suitable for comparison using semi-automated matching software (I 3
   S) of individual spot patterns behind the gills. Photo-identification
   showed that there was considerable loss of marker tags and enabled an
   estimation of the rate of tag loss. The combination of
   photo-identification with marker tagging identified a total of 512
   individual sharks over 2001–2007. Of these, there were 115 resightings in
   subsequent years with two sharks identified in 2001 resighted 5 years
   later in 2006 and another shark sighted in 2001 resighted in 2007.
   Estimates of abundance using conventional open mark–recapture models for
   2004–2007 were 348–488 sharks (95% confidence interval), with a high
   level of entry into the population by itinerants. Annual apparent
   survival probability was 0.343–0.781 over 2004–2007, with an average
   annual recapture probability of 0.201. These results are the first to
   suggest a highly transient population of whale sharks around the

   completes the sieving step of the GNFS for a 1024-bit number in one year.
   Its architecture is modular and consists of small ASICs connected by a
   specialized butterfly transport system. We estimate the costs of such a

AB Understanding the life history of an exploited fish species is an
   integral part of successful fisheries management and this information can
   be used in quantitative population assessments. The present study
   describes the quantitative relationships among age, growth and
   reproductive biology of two commercially exploited sharks from the Great
   Barrier Reef World Heritage Area (GBRWHA), namely, the spot-tail shark,
   Carcharhinus sorrah (n = 659) and the Australian blacktip shark, C.
   tilstoni (n = 512). Longevity estimates based on vertebral ageing were 9
   and 14 years for male and female C. sorrah and 13 and 15 years for C.
   tilstoni. However, an age-validation study failed to validate annual
   banding in larger individuals, suggesting that maximum age may be
   underestimated by vertebrae. C. sorrah grew to adult size relatively
   fast, reaching maturity at 2.3–2.4 years, whereas C. tilstoni grew
   slower, reaching maturity at 5.2–6.1 years. For both species, however,
   reproduction did not commence until approximately a year after maturity,
   at 3.4 years for C. sorrah and 7.2 years for C. tilstoni. The results of
   the present study suggest that in the GBRWHA, C. tilstoni, in particular,
   begins reproducing at an older age and lives longer than previously
   thought.

   caught in the shark nets which protect the swimming beaches of
   KwaZulu-Natal. This species constituted 0,97% of the total shark catch,
   with a mean annual catch of 13. Catch rates showed a significant decline
   during the period under review, from 0,66 to 0,09 sharks·km-net−1·year−1.
   Most sharks were caught in the north of the netted region between January
   and May. Catches at Mzamba, the southern extremity of the netted region,
   represent the southernmost records of this species on the east African
   coast. The males ranged in size from 106 cm precaudal length (18 kg) to
   264 cm (220 kg) and females from 140 cm (35 kg) to 326 cm (400 kg). Males
   matured at about 217 cm and females at 237 cm. Very few sharks were found
   in mating condition. Elasmobranchs were found in 82% of non-empty
   stomachs. There was a high incidence of stingrays (Dasyatidae),
   guitarfish (Rhinobatidae) and other bottom-dwelling fish in the diet.

   hydrophobicity ( P P > 0.05). The results suggest that gelatin
   hydrolysate with 10%DH was able to prevent the denaturation of surimi
   protein comparably to commercial cryoprotectant. However, it exhibited
   the higher protective effect on denaturation of myosin heavy chain,
   especially globular head domain. Therefore, gelatin hydrolysate can be an
   alternative cryoprotectant with the lower sweetness in surimi products.

AB Although an understanding of mating systems is thought to be an important

   characteristics are poorly known in sharks. Here, we employ polymorphic
   microsatellite markers to test for the occurrence and prevalence of
   multiple paternity in a population of the brown smoothhound shark,
   Mustelus henlei. We analyzed litters from 14 females sampled from the
   Pacific coast of Baja California Sur. The minimum number of sires ranged
   from one to three with an average of 2.3 sires per litter. Regression
   analyses did not indicate a relationship between female body size and
   number of sires, or female body size and size of the litter. A review of
   the existing literature on genetic mating systems in sharks suggests that
   polyandry may be common and that reproductive behavior may have evolved
   from conflicting selection pressures between the sexes.

AB To clarify the evolutionary origin of the linkage of the MHC class III

   from the banded hound shark (Triakis scyllium). Upon phylogenetic tree
   analysis, shark C4 formed a well-supported cluster with C4 of higher
   vertebrates, indicating that the C3/C4 gene duplication predated the
   divergence of cartilaginous fish from the main line of vertebrate
   evolution. The deduced amino acid sequence predicted the typical C4
   three-subunits chain structure, but without the histidine residue
   catalytic for the thioester bond, suggesting the human C4A-like
   specificity. The linkage analysis of the complement genes, one C4 and two
   factor B (Bf) genes, to the shark MHC was performed using 56 siblings
   from two typing panels of T. scyllium and Ginglymostoma cirratum. The C4
   and one of two Bf genes showed a perfect cosegregation with the class I
   and II genes, whereas two recombinants were identified for the other Bf
   gene. These results indicate that the linkage between the complement C4
   and Bf genes, as well as the linkage between these complement genes and
   the MHC class I and II genes were established before the emergence of
   cartilaginous fish >460 million years ago.

   (376 to 853 cm TL). Vertebral samples were obtained worldwide from
   museums and institutional and private collections. Examination of
   multiple vertebrae from along the vertebral column of 10 specimens
   indicated that vertebral morphology and band pair (alter- nating opaque
   and translucent bands) counts changed dramatically along an individual
   column. Smaller sharks had similar band pair counts along the length of
   the vertebral column while large sharks had a difference of up to 24 band
   pairs between the highest and lowest count along the col- umn. Our
   evidence indicates that band pair deposition may be related to growth and
   not time in this species and thus the basking shark cannot be directly

AB Abstract From the late 1970s to 1992, large-scale pelagic driftnet
   fisheries in the North Pacific targeted flying squid ( Ommastrephes
   bartrami ), tunas and billfishes. In the late 1980s, cooperative
   multinational scientific observer programs began on Japanese, South
   Korean, and Taiwanese driftnet fleets fishing in international waters.
   These programs resulted in some of the most comprehensive data on the
   distribution and abundance of epipelagic species in the North Pacific
   transition region. Eleven elasmobranch taxa were sighted by observers in
   the Japanese flying squid driftnet fishery. Blue sharks accounted for
   93.7% of the elasmobranch bycatch in 1990 and 1991. In 1991, observers
   collected biological data on a limited number of shark and fish species,
   including blue shark ( Prionace glauca ) and salmon shark ( Lamna
   ditropis ). Canada experimented with a flying squid driftnet fishery in
   coastal waters near British Columbia beginning in 1979 but it was
   terminated in 1987 because of unacceptable levels of bycatch. Blue shark
   and salmon shark CPUEs were an order of magnitude higher in the coastal
   Canadian experimental driftnet fishery than in the high seas squid
   driftnet fishery. The average size of blue sharks in coastal catches was
   larger than sharks caught in the high seas fishery. The seasonal pattern
   of CPUE in the Japanese squid driftnet fishery was consistent with the
   seasonal location of the fleet and the subtropical–subarctic ecological
   gradient that polarizes salmon and blue sharks. Errors-in-variables
   regression equations are provided to convert among total length, eye-fork
   length, and precaudal length measurements.

AB The dogfish shark (Squalus acanthias) rectal gland (SRG) cell has served
   as a model experimental system for investigating the relationship between
   the actin cytoskeleton and cell volume regulation. Previous reports
   employing conventional fluorescence microscopy of tissue slices have
   shown that cells exposed to high external K+ and hypotonically-induced
   cell swelling displayed a fading of F-actin staining intensity,
   particularly at the basolateral cell borders. However, spectroscopic
   measurement of the F-actin present in similarly treated rectal gland
   slices failed to demonstrate a net change in F-actin amount. In an effort
   to resolve the structural reorganizations of F-actin which may be
   occurring during high K+ and hypotonic shock treatments, we have used
   cultured SRG cells in conjunction with confocal microscopic
   immunocytochemical localization techniques to examine actin filament,
   microtubule, and cytokeratin filament dynamics under these two
   experimental conditions. The results reveal that F-actin in control cells
   exists in an array of parallel linear bundles (which do not appear to be
   stress fiber-like given their lack of staining for myosin II or
   alpha-actinin) that is reorganized to a punctate pattern in hypotonic
   shock and a dense meshwork in high K+. The linear bundle pattern of
   F-actin returns in cells undergoing regulatory volume decrease.
   Quantitative western blotting of F-actin in SRG cell detergent extracted
   cytoskeletons indicates no significant difference in the relative amounts
   of F-actin present in control, hypotonic shocked, or high K+ cells.
   Anti-tubulin and anti-cytokeratin labeling of the treated SRG cells
   suggest that these other major cytoskeletal elements are not
   significantly altered by the treatments. Taken together, our results
   reinforce the concept that there is an association between the structural
   organization of the actin cytoskeleton and cell volume regulation in the
   SRG epithelial cells. J. Exp. Zool. 279:415–424, 1997. © 1997 Wiley-Liss,

AB The Shark Bay environment has been shaped by Quaternary geologic events.
   The geomorphology of the embayment reflects the geometry and lithology of
   underlying rock units. The western and central parts of the region are
   underlain by dune rocks of Pleistocene age, and the numerous inlets and
   gulfs in the area are interdune depressions which were flooded by
   postglacial transgression. The eastern shore of the embayment is an
   alluvial coastal plain in the north and a terrain of flat-lying
   Cretaceous limestone and dolomite in the south. There were two phases of
   dune building in the early Pleistocene. The sediments of the Peron
   Sandstone were deposited during the first of these phases. This formation
   is present in the central area and is composed of red quartz sandstone.
   The second dune phase completed the basic architecture of the embayment.
   Large ridges of calcareous eolianite are present along the western
   perimeter. The eolianite units are grouped in one formation, the Tamala
   Eolianite. The ancestral dune landscape was flooded by the sea in three
   separate marine transgressions during the later part of the Quaternary.
   The transgressions, in order of decreasing age, are the Dampier marine
   phase, the Bibra marine phase, and the Holocene-Recent marine phase. The
   Dampier and Bibra transgressions occurred during the Pleistocene; they
   are represented by sequences of marine carbonate strata which crop out
   around the margins of the embayment and also lie beneath postglacial
   sediments in offshore areas. The outcropping Pleistocene rocks are
   intertidal and shallow subtidal facies whose distribution virtually
   defines the paleogeography of the embayment. The embayment during both
   the Dampier and Bibra phases was essentially similar to the present
   embayment. The transgressive depo its are separated by erosional
   unconformities marked by weathering phenomena, including the development
   of soils and calcrete. The environments associated with the Pleistocene
   transgressive phases were similar to the present environments of Shark
   Bay, and there is a general similarity of sediments and fossil
   assemblages between Recent and Pleistocene layers. Because the shorelines
   of Pleistocene phases were roughly coincident with the present datum,
   similar lithologies and fossil assemblages are repeated in stratigraphic
   sections.

   Age was estimated from sections of the second dorsal spine and validated
   by marginal increment analysis. Males attained a maximum age of 8 years
   while 11 year-old females were found. Several growth models were fitted
   and compared for both size-at-age and mass-at-age data, showing that even
   though this is a small-sized species, it has a relatively slow growth
   rate. This species matures late, specifically at 49·6 and 42·5% of the
   maximum observed ages for males and females, respectively. It has a low
   fecundity, with a mean ovarian fecundity of 9·94 oocytes and a mean
   uterine fecundity of 7·59 embryos per reproductive cycle. This species
   seems to have a long reproductive cycle, and even though no conclusive
   data were obtained, a 2–3 year cycle is possible. The estimated
   coefficients indicate that this species has a vulnerable life cycle,
   typical of deepwater squalid sharks. Given the high fishing pressures
   that it is suffering in the north-east Atlantic, this fish may already be
   facing severe declines or in risk of facing them in the near future.

AB Seven whale sharks were tracked using satellite-linked tags from Ningaloo
   Reef, off northern Western Australia, following tagging in April and June
   2002 and April–May 2005. We investigated how the movements of those whale
   shark tracks were influenced by geostrophic surface currents during
   sequential one-week periods by using a passive diffusion model
   parameterised with observed starting locations of the sharks and weekly
   maps of surface current velocity and direction (derived from altimetry).
   We compared the outputs from the passive diffusion model and maps of
   chlorophyll-a concentration (SeaWiFs/MODIS) and with the actual tracks of
   the sharks using GIS and generalized linear mixed-effects models (GLMM).
   The GLMM indicated very little support for passive diffusion with
   sea-surface ocean currents influencing whale shark distributions in the
   north eastern Indian Ocean. Moreover, the sharks' movements correlated
   only weakly with the spatial distribution of sea-surface chlorophyll-a
   concentrations. The seven whale sharks had average swimming speeds
   comparable with those recorded in other satellite tracking studies of
   this species. Swimming speeds of the seven sharks were similar to those
   reported in previous studies and up to three times greater than the
   maximum sea-surface current velocities that the sharks encountered while
   traversing into lower southerly latitudes (moving northward towards the
   equator). Our results indicate that whale sharks departing from Ningaloo
   travel actively and independently of near-surface currents where they
   spend most of their time despite additional metabolic costs of this
   behaviour.

AB Refined and validated age and growth determinations are necessary for a
   proper understanding of tiger shark (Galeocerdo cuvier) life history
   characteristics in the western North Atlantic (WNA). Age and growth
   estimates were derived from band counts of 238-sectioned vertebral
   centra. Bomb radiocarbon analysis of ten band pairs extracted from four
   vertebral sections suggested that band pairs are deposited annually up to
   age 20. Males and females were aged to 20 and 22 years, respectively,
   although longevity estimates predict maximum ages of 27 and 29 years,
   respectively. Two- and three-parameter von Bertalanffy and Gompertz
   growth functions fit to length at age data demonstrated that growth rates
   were similar for males and females up to around 200 cm fork length (FL)
   after which male growth slowed. Both sexes appear to reach maturity at
   age 10. The two-parameter von Bertalanffy growth function provided the
   best biological fit to length at age data generating parameter estimates
   of: L∞ = 330 cm FL, k = 0.131 for males and L∞ = 347 cm FL, k = 0.124 for
   females, with L0 set at 62 cm FL. This study provides a rigorous
   description of tiger shark age and growth in the WNA and further
   demonstrates the utility of bomb radiocarbon as an age validation tool

AB The structure of shark skin has been the subject of numerous studies and
   recently biomimetic shark skin has been fabricated with rigid denticles
   (scales) on a flexible substrate. This artificial skin can bend and
   generate thrust when attached to a mechanical controller. The ability to
   control the manufacture of biomimetic shark skin facilitates manipulation
   of surface parameters and understanding the effects of changing denticle
   patterns on locomotion. In this paper we investigate the effect of
   changing the spacing and arrangement of denticles on the surface of
   biomimetic shark skin on both static and dynamic locomotor performance.
   We designed 3D-printed flexible membranes with different denticle
   patterns and spacings: (1) staggered-overlapped, (2) linear-overlapped,
   and (3) linear-non-overlapped, and compared these to a 3D-printed
   smooth-surfaced control. These 3D printed shark skin models were then
   tested in a flow tank with a mechanical flapping device that allowed us
   to either hold the models in a stationary position or move them
   dynamically. We swam the membranes at a frequency of 1 Hz with different
   heave amplitudes (from ±1 cm to ±3 cm) while measuring forces, torques,
   self-propelled swimming speed, and cost of transport (COT). Static tests
   revealed drag reduction of denticle patterns compared to a smooth control
   at low speeds, but increased drag at speeds above 25 cm s−1. However,
   during dynamic (swimming) tests, the staggered-overlapped pattern
   produced the fastest swimming speeds with no significant increase in the
   COT at lower heave values. For instance, at a heave frequency of 1 Hz and
   amplitude of ±1 cm, swimming speed of the staggered-overlapped pattern
   increased by 25.2% over the smooth control. At higher heave amplitudes,
   significantly faster self-propelled swimming speeds were achieved by the
   staggered-overlapped pattern, but with higher COT. Only the
   staggered-overlapped pattern provides a significant swimming performance
   advantage over the smooth control and the other two denticle patterns.
   Quantitative hydrodynamic comparisons among skin models where control
   over manufacture allows alteration of design parameters provides a useful
   experimental tool for future work on the considerable natural diversity
   of shark skin denticles both among species and on different body

AB Dramatic declines in populations of large elasmobranchs, as well as the
   potential release of elasmobranch mesopredators, have led to interest in
   the ecological role of this group of fishes. The first step to
   elucidating their ecological importance, however, is an understanding of
   elasmobranch community structure. Such studies are relatively uncommon,
   especially in communities where human impacts are thought to be low. We
   used visual surveys and a variety of capture methods to determine spatial
   and temporal variation in the species composition of a sandflat
   elasmobranch community in the relatively pristine ecosystem of Shark Bay,
   Australia. Overall, juvenile batoids dominated the community. Eleven
   elasmobranch species (10 batoids, 1 shark) were found to inhabit the
   sandflats during the cold season (June–August) and 21 species (12
   batoids, 9 sharks) were recorded during the warm season. The overall
   density of elasmobranchs occupying the sandflat was also higher during
   the warm season. Nearshore areas, especially during the warm season,
   supported the highest densities of elasmobranchs overall as well as the
   dominant species (giant shovelnose ray, Glaucostegus typus, and
   reticulate whipray, Himantura uarnak). Such high elasmobranch abundance
   may be driven by a combination of factors including prey availability,
   predator avoidance, and behavioral thermoregulation. The high species
   richness and density of elasmobranchs in such a restricted area suggest
   that elasmobranch mesopredators could exert strong top-down impacts in
   nearshore environments in the absence of human impacts, but raises
   questions of how resources are partitioned among apparently similar
   species in this system.

AB Adult cartilaginous fish express three immunoglobulin (Ig) isotypes, IgM,
   IgNAR and IgW. Newborn nurse sharks, Ginglymostoma cirratum, produce 19S
   (multimeric) IgM and monomeric/dimeric IgM1gj, a germline-joined,
   IgM-related VH, and very low amounts of 7S (monomeric) IgM and IgNAR
   proteins. Newborn IgNAR VH mRNAs are diverse in the
   complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3) with non-templated nucleotide
   (N-region) addition, which suggests that, unlike in many other
   vertebrates, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) expressed at
   birth is functional. IgW is present in the lungfish, a bony fish sharing
   a common ancestor with sharks 460 million years ago, implying that the
   IgW VH family is as old as the IgM VH family. This nurse shark study
   examined the IgM and IgW VH repertoire from birth through adult life, and
   analyzed the phylogenetic relationships of these gene families. IgM and
   IgW VH cDNA clones isolated from newborn nurse shark primary and
   secondary lymphoid tissues had highly diverse and unique CDR3 with
   N-region addition and VDJ gene rearrangement, implicating functional TdT
   and RAG gene activity. Despite the clear presence of N-region additions,
   newborn CDR3 were significantly shorter than those of adults. The IgM
   clones are all included in a conventional VH family that can be
   classified into five discrete groups, none of which is orthologous to IgM
   VH genes in other elasmobranchs. In addition, a novel divergent VH family
   was orthologous to a published monotypic VH horn shark family. IgW VH
   genes have diverged sufficiently to form three families. IgM and IgW VH
   serine codons using the potential somatic hypermutation hotspot sequence
   occur mainly in VH framework 1 (FR1) and CDR1. Phylogenetic analysis of
   cartilaginous fish and lungfish IgM and IgW demonstrated they form two
   major ancient gene groups; furthermore, these VH genes generally
   diversify (duplicate and diverge) within a species. As in ratfish,
   sandbar and horn sharks, most nurse shark IgM VH genes are from one
   family with multiple, heterogeneous loci. Their IgW VH genes have
   diversified, forming at least three families. The neonatal shark Ig VH
   CDR3 repertoire, diversified via N-region addition, is shorter than the
   adult VDJ junction, suggesting one means of postnatal repertoire
   diversification is expression of longer CDR3 junctions.

AB Understanding the movements of species, particularly those that may exert
   strong influence on community struc- ture or that may be susceptible to
   human perturbations, is critical to effectively conserve and manage
   populations. How- ever, the study of movement behavior in marine fishes
   has been historically difficult and typically produces a limited amount
   of data (i.e., start and end points). We use an array of automated
   acoustic receivers to monitor autumn and winter movement patterns of
   sixgill sharks (Hexanchus griseus (Bonnaterre, 1788)) in Puget Sound,
   Washington, USA. Daily movement of sharks and maximum distance moved from
   tagging sites varied with size, with larger sharks having shorter daily
   movements and maximum distances from tagging locations than smaller
   sharks. Sharks were detected at the same site as the previous day 76% of
   the time. Movement away from the shark's tagging location increased
   slightly over the du- ration of the study, but most sharks occupied the
   same sites for most of the study. These relatively small and stable move-
   ment patterns could lead to localized, top-down impacts from sixgill
   sharks and suggest that local human perturbations, such as fishing or
   pollution, have the potential to negatively affect local populations of
   sixgill sharks. Resume ´ : Afin de conserver et de gerer efficacement les
   populations, il est essentiel de comprendre les deplacements des especes,
   particulierement de celles qui peuvent exercer une forte influence sur la

   deplacement des poissons marins s'est averee difficile dans le passeet
   elle genere typiquement des donnees limitees (par ex., les points de

   pour suivre les patrons de deplacement des requins grisets (Hexanchus
   griseus (Bonnaterre, 1788)) dans Puget Sound, Washington, E ´ .-U. Les
   deplacements journaliers et la distance maximale parcourue depuis le site

   requins ont des de´- placements journaliers plus reduits et les distances
   maximales qu'ils parcourent depuis le site de marquage sont plus courtes
   que celles des requins plus petits. Les requins se retrouvent au meme

   site de marquage deviennent un peu plus importants au cours de l'etude,

   grande partie de l'investigation. Ces patrons de deplacements

   for the common thresher sharkis concentrated. Eightcommonthreshers
   (forklength: 122-203cm) weretaggedwith temperature
   anddepth-sensingacoustic transmitters and tracked for periods ranging
   from 22 to 49h. Tracked sharks preferentially utilized deep offshore
   waters, and avoided shallower waters over the continental shelf. Mean
   rate of movement (ROMs.d.) was 2.15 � 0.46kmh � 1 . ROM and
   angularconcentration(r,ameasureofrelativelinearity)bothshowedastrongdaytimepattern,withhighestvaluesatdawn

   excursions below the thermocline or relatively level swimming within the
   upper portion of the thermocline. Nocturnally, all sharks remained within
   the mixed layer. These findings suggest that the common thresher shark is
   primarily a daytime predator, and have relevance for estimating how the
   alteration of the set depth of fishing-gear could affect catch rates of
   this species in the SCB.

AB Studies of feeding in bony fishes have almost universally demonstrated
   the ability of individuals to modulate their method of capture in
   response to differing stimuli. Preliminary evidence indicates that
   morphologically specialized inertial suction feeding sharks are the most
   likely fishes to lack inherent modulatory ability. We examined the
   ability of the nurse shark, Ginglymostoma cirratum, to modulate its
   feeding behavior based on different food types and sizes. G. cirratum is
   an inertial suction feeding fish that is apparently stereotyped in its
   food capture behavior. Electromyography showed no statistical difference
   between feeding motor patterns based on food type (squid or fish) or size
   (gape width or twice gape width), although there were slight
   inter-individual differences in the onset of muscle firing for some
   muscles. Kinematic analysis showed a statistical difference in variables
   associated with durations for different food types, with the durations
   for all variables being faster for squid bites than fish bites, but no
   difference based on the size of the food item. This apparent lack of
   modulation may be associated with specialization of the morphology and
   behavior of G. cirratum for obligate suction prey capture. This
   functional specialization constrains the method in which G. cirratum
   captures prey but does not appear to result in dietary specialization. An
   unusual post capture spit-suck manipulation allows this shark to handle
   and ingest large prey.

AB : The secondary olfactory connections in the shark Scyliorhinus canicula
   and the ray Raja clavata have been studied with reduced silver
   techniques. After transections through the pedunculus olfactorius in
   Scyliorhinus degenerating fibers could be traced to the telencephalic
   hemisphere. On entering the hemisphere these fibers subdivide into a
   small medial and a larger lateral olfactory tract. The medial tract
   distributes fibers to the lateral part of the ipsilateral pallium
   dorsale, pars superficialis and area periventricularis pallialis, but the
   majority of its fibers terminate in the submeningeal zone of the pallium.
   The medial olfactory tract also projects contralaterally to the
   submeningeal pallial zone via the commissura olfactoria inferior and to
   the stratum granulare bulbi olfactorii by way of the commissura
   olfactoria superior. The lateral olfactory tract distributes mainly to
   the pallium laterale and to the region superficial to the lateral part of
   the area superficialis basalis, though the striatum also receives some
   fibers. In Raja the secondary olfactory tract could not be subdivided
   into medial and lateral components and its projections seem to be
   restricted to the ipsilateral pallium laterale. A striking difference
   between Scyliorhinus and Raja is that in the latter no contralateral
   projections could be recognized nor a projection to the area
   superficialis basalis. When these results are compared with those
   reported in the literature for other cartilaginous fishes, it appears
   that the secondary olfactory connections of Scyliorhinus are more
   extensive than in other chondrichthians studied experimentally. In some
   cases of peduncle transection in Scyliorhinus the lateral part of the
   striatum was also involved in the lesion. In addition to the pattern of
   degeneration seen after olfactory peduncle lesions, degenerating fibers
   could be distinguished both in the stria medullaris and basal forebrain
   bundle. The former projects to habenular nucleus, whereas the latter
   distributes to the hypothalamus, ventral thalamus, and brainstem
   tegmentum.

AB Abstract The effector of spontaneous cytotoxicity from shark peripheral
   blood has been shown to be a macrophage-like cell. Effector cells are
   isolated by centrifugation over Lymphocyte Separation Medium, adherence
   to glass, Percoll density gradient centrifugation and adherence to
   fibronectin sequentially. Effector cells are adherent to glass, sediment
   to densities of 1.048–1.052 g/ml and are adherent to fibronectin. The
   isolated effectors represent less than 1% of the peripheral blood
   leukocytes, and exhibit potent cytotoxic capability, both spontaneous and
   in the presence of phytohemagglutinin. In addition, the activity of these
   cells is resistant to 3000 rads gamma irradiation. Although nurse sharks
   have natural antibody to trinitrophenol, spontaneously cytotoxic cells
   are incapable of killing trinitrophenol modified targets indicating that
   natural antibody is not required for reactivity, and that natural
   antibody and spontaneous effectors do not have the same repertoire.
   However, cold target inhibition studies showed that these effector cells
   can recognize four of five human lymphomyeloid targets. It is concluded
   that the spontaneous, extracellular killing by the macrophage-like
   effector most closely resembles that of activated mammalian tumoricidal
   macrophages with the exception that they do not appear to require in
   vitro activation.

AB Abstract The shark fauna from the Anisian of Nevada is dominated by
   durophagous hybodontiforms but also shows an important neoselachian
   component. Two new species of hybodontiform sharks, Acrodus cuneocostatus
   and PolyIacrodus bucheri , are described in addition to a new
   neoselachian taxon Mucrovenator minimus . The enameloid of the teeth of
   Acrodus and Polyacrodus comprises two layers, an outer compact layer and
   an inner bundled layer. For the typical three-layered enameloid of
   neoselachian teeth, we propose to replace the terms parallel-fibred
   enameloid and tangled-fibred enameloid by the more appropriate
   parallel-bundled and tangled-bundled enameloid.

AB Summary The peculiar head morphology of hammerhead sharks has spawned a
   variety of untested functional hypotheses. One of the most intu itively
   appealing ideas is that the anterior foil acts, as in canard-winged
   aircraft, to increase maneuverability. We tested this hypothesis by
   determining whether juveniles of two hammerhead species (Sphyrna tiburo
   and S. lewini) turn more sharply, more often, and with greater velocity
   than a juvenile carcharhinid shark ( Carcharhinus plumbeus). Although the
   hammerheads were more maneuverable, further investigation revealed that
   they do not roll their body during turns, suggesting that the cephalofoil
   does not act as a steering wing. We also show that hammerhead sharks
   demonstrate greater lateral flexure in a turn than carcharhinids, and
   that this flexibility may be due to cross sectional shape rather than
   number of vertebrae.

AB The leopard shark (Triakis semifasciata) is an important predator in
   coastal marine ecosystems of California, targeted by recreational and
   commercial fishermen and of specific interest in fisheries management.
   From October 2003 to August 2006, 169 leopard sharks were collected from
   the coast of California (between 40.750°N and 32.678°N) and analyzed for
   mitochondrial and nuclear genetic structure. Analyses of mtDNA control
   region sequences revealed relatively low levels of genetic variation
   (five haplotypes, average pairwise divergence π = 0.0067). In contrast,
   leopard sharks were highly polymorphic for inter simple sequence repeats
   (ISSRs), which characterize a broad range of the nuclear genome. The null
   hypothesis of panmixia in California waters was rejected for both genetic
   markers, and ISSRs displayed a statistically significant pattern of
   isolation by distance (IBD) across the species range (P = 0.002). A
   variety of analyses showed that divergence is most pronounced in the
   northernmost population of Humboldt Bay. Natal philopatry in T.
   semifasciata was tested using Siegel-Tukey tests on data partitioned by
   breeding site status, and sex-specific philopatry was tested by comparing
   IBD plots between sexes. Although there was some evidence for natal
   philopatry in leopard sharks (P = 0.038), and population divergence may
   be related to the proximity of breeding sites (P = 0.064), we found no
   support for sex-specific philopatry. In addition to identifying a novel
   set of highly variable genetic markers for use in shark population
   studies, these results may be used to better inform management decisions
   for leopard sharks in California.

AB Killing sharks is a popular strategy for reducing risk for beach-goers
   and ocean-users. But the effectiveness of kill-based strategies is
   debated and the ecological and economic costs are high. In Western
   Australia the state government introduced new policy in 2012 in response
   to shark-related fatalities, to track, catch and destroy sharks deemed to
   pose an ‘imminent threat’ to beach-goers. This paper reports on a survey
   of Western Australia-based ocean-users, and pursues two aims: to develop
   an understanding of the experiences of ocean-users in encountering
   sharks; and to learn about the attitudes of ocean-users towards shark
   hazard management. The research finds that people encounter sharks often,
   without harm, and that most ocean-users adapt their practices in order to
   reduce personal risk. The majority of ocean-users oppose the kill-based
   elements of the new policy, and kill-based shark hazard management
   strategies more broadly. Rather, ocean-users strongly support further
   research and education focusing on shark behaviour and shark deterrents,
   and approaches that enable people to understand and accept risks
   associated with ocean use. These findings present opportunity to refocus
   debates about shark hazard management on non-lethal strategies in concert
   with better educating publics so they can make informed decisions about
   their ocean-based activities.

AB Group behaviours are widespread among fish but comparatively little is
   known about the interactions between free-ranging individuals and how
   these might change across different spatio-temporal scales. This is
   largely due to the difficulty of observing wild fish groups directly
   underwater over long enough time periods to quantify group structure and
   individual associations. Here we describe the use of a novel technology,
   an animal-borne acoustic proximity receiver that records close-spatial
   associations between free-ranging fish by detection of acoustic signals
   emitted from transmitters on other individuals. Validation trials, held
   within enclosures in the natural environment, on juvenile lemon sharks
   Negaprion brevirostris fitted with external receivers and transmitters,
   showed receivers logged interactions between individuals regularly when
   sharks were within 4 m (∼4 body lengths) of each other, but rarely when
   at 10 m distance. A field trial lasting 17 days with 5 juvenile lemon
   sharks implanted with proximity receivers showed one receiver
   successfully recorded association data, demonstrating this shark
   associated with 9 other juvenile lemon sharks on 128 occasions. This
   study describes the use of acoustic underwater proximity receivers to
   quantify interactions among wild sharks, setting the scene for new
   advances in understanding the social behaviours of marine animals.

AB Intrapopulation differences in diet and/or movement are important for
   understanding the role mobile predators play in different systems.
   However, ecological studies traditionally overlook individual
   differences. δ13C and δ15N were used in conjunction with diet and
   movement information to identify intrapopulation differences in diet and
   movement patterns of the apex predator broadnose sevengill shark
   Notorynchus cepedianus in southeast Tasmania. Sevengill samples from 3
   inshore and 3 offshore sites were collected, and δ13C and δ15N compared
   between sites, sizes and sexes. Individuals captured offshore had lower
   δ15N than those captured inshore, indicating some degree of spatial
   segregation. Sevengills also had variable δ13C and δ15N within coastal
   habitats, suggesting intrapopulation differences in diet or migration
   schedules. In comparison to their main prey, most individuals had δ15N
   lower than expected for a top predator, also suggesting that they do not
   reside permanently in these areas, as their tissue was not in isotopic
   equilibrium with their known prey. This is in agreement with tracking
   data that showed seasonal use of coastal areas, with most animals leaving
   for the colder months but returning the following year. There was also a
   group of females with relatively high δ13C that suggests greater
   association to coastal habitats, again in agreement with tracking data,
   as some tagged females remained in the coastal areas over winter.
   Overall, together with diet and tracking information, results indicate
   that there are differences in movement and possibly diet in this
   sevengill population. This multimethods approach allowed a better
   understanding of sevengill ecology than the use of any one of the
   techniques alone.

   determined the residue levels and patterns of PCBs, OH-PCBs, PBDEs,
   OH-PBDEs and methoxylated PBDEs (MeO-PBDEs) in the blood collected from
   scalloped hammerhead shark ( Sphyrna lewini ) and Japanese amberjack (
   Seriola quinqueradiata ), species of predatory fish at Japanese coastal
   waters. The predominant homologues found in Japanese amberjacks were
   mono- and di-chlorinated OH-PCBs, and scalloped hammerhead sharks were
   octa-chlorinated OH-PCBs. The predominant OH-PCB isomers were
   lower-chlorinated OH-PCBs such as 6OH-CB2 and 2′OH-CB9 in Japanese
   amberjacks. This result suggests that exposure of Japanese amberjacks to
   lower-chlorinated OH-PCBs might be from the ambient aquatic environment.
   In scalloped hammerhead sharks, 4,4′diOH-CB202, 4OH-CB201 and 4OH-CB146
   were the predominant isomers accounting for approximately 60% of the
   total OH-PCBs. The predominant MeO-PBDE isomers were 6MeO-BDE47 followed
   by 2′MeO-BDE68 in both species. As for OH-PBDE isomers, 6OH-BDE47 was
   predominant followed by 2′OH-BDE68 in Japanese amberjacks and scalloped
   hammerhead sharks. Residue levels of ΣMeO-PBDEs and ΣOH-PBDEs showed a
   significant positive correlation ( p = 0.029). This result suggests that
   MeO-PBDEs and OH-PBDEs share a common source or a metabolic pathway in
   fishes. Characteristic differences found in the profiles of OH-PCBs and
   OH-PBDEs in Japanese amberjack and scalloped hammerhead shark show the
   need for further studies on the differences in exposure profiles,
   metabolic capacities and toxic effects in fish.

AB Chondrychthyans (cartilaginous fishes) are key to understanding the
   ancestral gnathostome condition since they provide an outgroup to
   sarcopterygians and actinopterygians. To gain comparative knowledge about
   the development of the vertebrate serotoninergic systems, we studied by
   immunohistochemistry the origin, spatiotemporal organization, and
   migration patterns of serotonin-containing neurons and the growth of
   axonal pathways in the central nervous system of a shark, the lesser
   spotted dogfish. Hindbrain serotonin-immunoreactive cells arose close to
   the floor plate and most populations migrated ventrally and
   mediolaterally to form the various raphe and reticular groups. The order
   of appearance of serotoninergic populations in the rhombencephalon and
   spinal cord (first the superior groups and then the inferior and spinal
   populations) roughly matched with that reported in other vertebrates but
   important differences were noted in the formation of prosencephalic
   groups in fishes. In addition to preoptic and hypothalamic areas,
   serotoninergic cerebrospinal fluid-contacting cells were observed in the
   isthmus (raphe dorsalis anterioris). Transient serotonin-immunoreactive
   cells were noted in the pineal organ, habenula, and pretectum. Further,
   we provide a revised anatomical framework for reticular and raphe
   serotoninergic populations considering their origin and segmental
   organization. Two distinct phases of development of the serotoninergic
   innervation were distinguished, that of the formation of the main axonal
   pathways and that of the branching of fibers. The development of main
   serotoninergic ascending pathways in dogfish was notably similar to that
   described in mammals. Our findings suggest the conservation of
   developmental patterns in serotoninergic systems and enhance the
   importance of elasmobranchs for understanding the early evolution of this
   system in vertebrates. J. Comp. Neurol. 511:804–831, 2008. © 2008

   was not detected in whole serum. The conditions of its generation and its
   immunoelectrophoretic behavior seem to indicate that it is an
   enzymatically formed cleavage product of a precursor contained in whole
   shark serum. The inactivator was partially purified and characterized. It
   had an S-value of 3.3 (sucrose gradient) which was in agreement with its
   retardation on gel filtration, was stable between pH 5.0 and 10.0, had a
   half-life of 5 min at 56°C, pH 7.5, was inactivated by trypsin and was
   nontoxic. Its powerful anticomplementary activity in vitro and in vivo
   was solely due to the rapid inactivation of C'4; no other complement
   components were affected. No cofactor requirement was observed for the
   equally rapid inactivation of highly purified human and guinea pig C'4.
   The kinetics of C'4 inactivation and TAME hydrolysis, the greater anodic
   mobility of inactivated human C'4, and the influence of temperature on
   the rate of inactivation suggest that the inactivator is an enzyme and
   C'4 its substrate. This conclusion was supported by the more recent
   detection of a split product of C'4. Intravenous administration of the
   C'4 inactivator could prevent lethal Forssman shock and suppress the
   Arthus reaction in guinea pigs; it prolonged significantly the rejection
   time of renal xenografts but had no detectable effect on passive
   cutaneous anaphylaxis. Anaphylatoxin could be generated in C'4 depleted
   guinea pig serum with the cobra venom factor, but not with immune
   precipitates. The possible relationship between C'1 esterase and the C'4
   inactivator is discussed on the basis of similarities and
   dissimilarities.

   predator in arctic waters. Greenland sharks have previously been
   considered scavengers, but recent studies suggest that Greenland sharks
   also predate on live prey. In this study, distribution and feeding
   ecology in Greenland waters were investigated. Based on data from 25
   years of surveys, Greenland sharks were usually caught at 400–700 m but
   were found at all depths between 100 and 1,200 m. Based on examination of
   stomachs from 30 Greenland sharks (total length of 258–460 cm), the most
   important prey items were Atlantic cod (65.6 % IRI), harp seal (9.9 %
   IRI), skates (5.2 % IRI) and wolffish (4.4 % IRI), but large geographical
   variations were observed. Prey composition and qualitative observations
   support the hypothesis of active predation. Consistent with other
   studies, the results of this work support the notion that the Greenland
   shark is an apex predator with the potential to influence trophic
   dynamics in the Arctic.

AB The current status of the whiskery shark (Furgaleus macki) stock in
   south-western Australia was assessed using an age and sex structured
   model. The best estimates of total and mature biomass in 1997/1998 were
   38.8% of virgin, and 23.0% of virgin, respectively. The 95% confidence
   intervals for total biomass were 22.7-47.2%, and for mature biomass were
   13.4-36.4%. Thirteen scenarios were used to test the sensitivity of the
   model to catch and effort, biological, and gear parameters. The estimates
   of current biomass were most sensitive to variations in catch and effort
   data. A scenario testing the use of raw catch and effort data produced
   unrealistically low estimates of current biomass, while a scenario
   testing the hypothesis that there had been no efficiency increases in the
   fishery over time indicated that biomass was currently higher than
   indicated by the best estimate. The remainder of the scenarios tested
   produced estimates of total biomass between 32 and 40% of virgin, and
   mature biomass between 21 and 30% of virgin. Risk analysis was used to
   test three biological reference points: that the total biomass would be
   at least 40% of virgin by 2010/2011 (a management committee target), that
   the total biomass in 2010/2011 will not be below that of 1996/1997, and
   that the stock would collapse. The results of risk analysis indicates
   that to achieve at least a 50% probability for the first two biological
   reference points, annual catches would need to be below 190 tonnes until
   2010. The probability of a population crash before 2010 is approximately
   5% when future catches are 175 tonnes, and greater than 50% when catches
   are above 280 tonnes. Risk analysis indicates that there is a need to
   substantially reduce commercial catches if the target set by the
   management committee is to be met.

AB Hamelin and Freycinet Basins are shallow ( During the equivalent
   interval, Hamelin Basin passed through a transitory metahaline phase to
   its present hypersaline (56-70^pmil salinity) concentration. In the
   metahaline phase, sedimentation was dominated by seagrass communities
   forming sediments of the Bank Unit similar to those in contemporary
   Freycinet Basin. The gradual onset of hypersalinity marked the cessation
   of bank growth. As waters reached hypersaline concentrations, the biota
   was restricted to mollusks and algae. Coquina, microcoquina, ooid
   grainstone, intraclast breccia, pelletal sediment, and cryptalgal
   boundstone of the Sublittoral Sheet and Intertidal Veneer units were
   formed. Platforms of grainstone and coquina spilled over the relict bank
   structures into central basin regions. Storm ridges (Hamelin Coquina
   unit) o grainstone and coquina were deposited in the supratidal zone, and
   gypsum precipitation commenced in marginal ponds and tidal flats. The
   increase in salinity in both basins has been due primarily to
   construction of large barrier seagrass banks at their northern
   extremities throughout Holocene-recent time. The barrier banks
   partitioned the landlocked basins from open, northern reaches of Shark
   Bay and thus acted as sills that progressively decreased tidal flushing.
   If future sea level is static, salinities will increase further in both
   basins, possibly culminating in phases of evaporite deposition.

AB Diagenetic phenomena in recent carbonate sediments from Shark Bay,
   Western Australia, are studied in terms of sedimentary units and
   diagenetic environments related to concentration gradients in embayment
   waters and groundwater brines. The Hamelin Coquina comprises beach- and
   storm-ridge deposits, pelecypod coquina, and ooid grainstone. Three
   diagenetic environments influence these sediments. In the vadose soil
   profile, solution takes place in the upper layer, and solution and
   precipitation occur in the gravitational zone. Skeletal aragonite
   undergoes neomorphic replacement by blocky calcite; sparry calcite forms
   cement. The phreatic zone contains groundwater brine (31-184^pmil Cl); no
   diagenetic alteration occurs. The intertidal zone contains hypersaline
   (31-39^pmil Cl) waters; cementation is by cryptocrystalline aragonite.
   The Intertidal Veneer includes sheet deposits in intertidal and
   supratidal zones; primary sediments of skeletal-fragment grainstone and
   ooid grainstone are altered to pellet grainstone and packstone in most
   diagenetic fields. The oceanic metahaline field (19-31^pmil Cl) is
   characterized by bioturbation structures and textures, by homogeneous to
   burrow-mottled structure and fragmented skeletal grains, and by tubular
   fenestral fabrics (root molds) in the supratidal zone. Features of the
   hypersaline field (31-39^pmil Cl) are pellets and pelletoid rinds,
   cryptocrystalline aragonite cement, cryptalgal fabrics, and intraclast
   pavements and breccia. The aragonite field (39-65^pmil Cl) is
   characterized by pellets and pelletoid rinds; cryptocrystalline aragonite
   cement; cryptalgal fabrics; and intraclast pavements, breccia, and
   grainstone. In the gypsum field (65-184^pmil Cl), diagenetic features are
   gypsum crystallization and disruption of earlier fabrics, intraclast
   breccia and grainstone, and porphyroblastic gypsum. The ephemeral
   brine-brackish field (0-184^pmil Cl) occurs in the vadose profile.
   Diagenesis results in pellets and pelletoids rinds; cryptocrystalline
   aragonite cement; intraclast pavements and breccia; dome, boxwork, and
   tent structures; tubular fenestral fabrics; and replacement of aragonite
   as a result of dolomitization. The Sublittoral Sheet comprises sheet- to
   wedge-shaped bodies of grainstone (skeletal, ooid, lithoskel, and quartz)
   and coquina. Deposition takes place from low water to 6-m depth, in the
   emergent intertidal zone. The metahaline field is characterized by
   bioturbation structures and textures; the sediment is homogeneous to
   burrow-mottled. Diagenetic features of the hypersaline field are acicular
   aragonite cement and intraclast breccia. In the intertidal zone,
   hypersaline-field conditions result in pellets and pelletoid rinds,
   cryptocrystalline aragonite cement, and cryptalgal fabrics. Features of
   the ephemeral brine-brackish field are cement of microcrystalline
   aragonite and tubular fenestral fabric (root molds). The Bank Unit
   contains sheets, wedges, and mounds of skeletal packstone, wackestone,
   and grainstone. Only in the metahaline field are bioturbation structures
   and textures present. These include homogeneous to burrow-mottled fabrics
   and fragmented skeletal elements. Pyritized grains also characterize the
   metahaline field. The Basal Sheet, a sheet deposit formed on the deep
   embayment floor, includes transgressive deposits. Features of the oceanic
   to metahaline fields are bioturbation structures and textures, angular
   skeletal elements, and pyritized grains. The hypersaline field is
   characterized by acicular aragonite cement.

   affected the inter-subunit disulfide linkages of the 18.5S antibody

AB Abstract In light of previous work showing a marked metabolic alkalosis
   (“alkaline tide”) in the bloodstream after feeding in the dogfish shark
   (Squalus acanthias), we evaluated whether there was a corresponding net
   base excretion to the water at this time. In the 48 h after a natural
   voluntary meal (teleost tissue, averaging 5.5% of body weight), dogfish
   excreted 10,470 μmol kg−1 more base (i.e. HCO3− equivalents) than the
   fasted control animals (which exhibited a negative base excretion of
   −2160 μmol kg−1). This large activation of branchial base excretion after
   feeding thereby prevented a potentially fatal alkalinization of the body
   fluids by the alkaline tide. The rate peaked at 330 μmol kg−1 h−1 at
   12.5–24 h after the meal. Despite a prolonged 1.7-fold elevation in M O 2
   after feeding (“specific dynamic action”), urea-N excretion decreased by
   39% in the same 48 h period relative to fasted controls. In contrast,
   ammonia-N excretion did not change appreciably. The N/O2 ratio declined
   from 0.51 in fasted animals to 0.19 in fed sharks, indicating a
   stimulation of N-anabolic processes at this time. These results, which
   differ greatly from those in teleost fish, are interpreted in terms of
   the fundamentally different ureotelic osmoregulatory strategy of
   elasmobranchs, and recent discoveries on base excretion and
   urea-retention mechanisms in elasmobranch gills.

AB In this paper, we examine the expenditure of whale shark tour
   participants at Ningaloo Marine Park, Western Australia; the location of
   the world's first whale shark tourism industry, established in 1989. We
   demonstrate that in 2006, participants' expenditure in the region was
   $894 per trip, total expenditure was $6.0 million (all figures are in
   Australian dollars), and between $2.4 and $4.6 million would have been
   lost to the region if whale shark tourism did not exist. Our measure of
   participants' expenditure is substantially lower than the calculation of
   $2370 per participant from a previous study of whale shark tourists using
   data collected in 1995. We argue that this is consistent with a change in
   the types of wildlife tourists that participate in an activity as the
   industry reaches the point of consolidation. Our results also suggest
   that using old data to forecast wildlife tourists' expenditure needs to
   take into account the industry's stage of development.

   data collection dives were conducted from December 2008 to January 2009.
   Grey nurse shark and diver behaviour were documented using 2-min scan
   samples and continuous observation. The proportion of time spent
   observing human–shark interactions was 9.4% of total field time and mean
   human–shark interaction time was 15.0 min. Results were used to gauge the
   effectiveness of current management practices for the grey nurse shark
   dive industry at Fish Rock in New South Wales, Australia. Grey nurse
   shark dive tourists were compliant to stipulations in the code of conduct
   and legislation (compliance ranged from 88 to 100%). The research
   detailed factors that may promote compliance in wildlife tourism
   operations such as the clarity of the stipulations, locality of the
   target species and diver perceptions of sharks. Results indicated that
   grey nurse sharks spent the majority of their time milling (85%) followed
   by active swimming (15%). Milling behaviour significantly decreased in
   the presence of more than six divers. Distance between sharks and divers,
   interaction time and number of sharks were not significantly correlated
   with grey nurse shark school behaviour. Jaw gaping, rapid withdrawal and
   stiff or jerky movement were the specific behaviours of grey nurse sharks
   that occurred most frequently and were associated with distance between
   divers and sharks and the presence of six or more divers. Revision of the
   number of divers allowed per interaction with a school of grey nurse
   sharks and further research on the potential impacts that shark-diving
   tourism may pose to grey nurse sharks is recommended.

   Results revealed a highly structured population comprised almost entirely
   of juveniles and adult females with individuals between 850 and 1050mm
   total length effectively absent. Mature males were also rarely
   encountered with adult sex ratio highly biased towards females
   (female:male=7:1). Mating scars were observed on adult females between
   December and April, and parturition was observed from December to March.
   Regression analysis showed that catch rates were significantly higher
   during the summer wet season between November and May. Recapture data
   suggested a highly resident population with a recapture rate of 21% and a
   mean recapture distance of 0 center dot 8km. In addition, 33% of
   recaptured animals were captured multiple times, indicating long-term
   residency. Most recaptures were, however, of adults with few juveniles
   recaptured. Widespread sampling at the study site and in adjacent areas
   suggested that the population was highly localized to a specific bay. The
   bimodal and sex-segregated population structure observed here differs
   from previous reports for this species, and in combination with
   reproductive observations, suggests population structuring to facilitate
   reproductive and recruitment success. These data also highlight the
   potential ecosystem functions performed by coastal habitats in sustaining

   elasmobranch species have been targeted by such operations in a variety
   of locations for over 4 decades. A recent review succinctly addressed the
   potential effects of shark diving tourism, including shark provisioning,
   on shark individual behavior and ecology, but the paucity of data on the
   ecology of elasmobranchs precluded general statements. By using a
   functional framework, we reviewed the findings of the 22 available

   response of 14 shark and 3 ray species targeted by artificial
   provisioning. Focusing on the underlying processes that rule the response
   of targeted elasmobranch species, we report further effects acting beyond
   the individual scale. We suggest that the most commonly described
   alterations of individual movement patterns have cascading effects
   through the group and community scales, ultimately resulting in altered
   health condition and individual behavior toward humans. We conclude by
   stressing the potential for provisioning activities to support the
   investigation of complex ecological and behavioral processes in

AB Abstract The blue shark has been subject to bycatch fishing mortality in
   the western North Atlantic for almost a half-century. Nevertheless, stock
   status is ambiguous and improved input data are needed for stock
   assessments. It is particularly important to obtain reliable indices of
   abundance because of the uncertainty in estimates of bycatch. An index of
   relative abundance (catch-per-unit effort, CPUE) is developed for western
   North Atlantic blue sharks, starting from the mid-1950s, when industrial
   pelagic longline tuna fisheries began. Longline catch and effort records
   from recent observer programs (1980–1990s) were linked with longline
   survey records from both historical archives and recent cruises
   (1950–1990s). Generalized linear models (GLM) were used to remove the
   effects of diverse fishing target practices, geographical and seasonal
   variability that affect blue shark catch rates. The analysis revealed a
   decline in blue shark CPUE of approximately 30% in the western North
   Atlantic from 1957 to 2000. The magnitude of this CPUE decline was less
   than other recently published estimates and seems reasonable in light of
   the high productivity of the blue shark revealed by life-history studies
   and preliminary stock assessments.

AB Abstract Vertebrates differ in their regulation of gastric acid secretion
   during periods of fasting, yet it is unknown why these differences occur.
   Elasmobranch fishes are the earliest known vertebrates to develop an acid
   secreting stomach and as such may make a good comparative model for
   determining the causative factors behind these differences. We measured
   gastric pH and temperature continuously during periods of fasting in
   captive free-swimming nurse sharks (Ginglymostoma cirratum) using
   autonomous pH/temperature data-loggers. All nurse sharks secreted strong
   gastric acids (minimum pH 0.4) after feeding; however, for most of the
   sharks, pH increased to 8.2–8.7, 2–3 days after feeding. Half of the
   sharks also exhibited periodic oscillations in pH when the stomach was
   empty that ranged from 1.1 to 8.7 (acid secretion ceased for 11.3 ± 4.3 h
   day− 1). This is in contrast to the gastric pH changes observed from
   leopard sharks (Triakis semifasciata) in a previous study, where the
   stomach remains acidic during fasting. The leopard shark is a relatively
   active, more frequently feeding predator, and continuous acid secretion
   may increase digestive efficiency. In contrast, the nurse shark is less
   active and is thought to feed less frequently. Periodic cessation of acid
   secretion may be an energy conserving mechanism used by animals that feed
   infrequently and experience extended periods of fasting.

AB The structural variability between the two known relaxin sequences from
   the pig [l-3] and rat [4] far exceed that observed for any insulin pair,
   yet their primary sequences can readily be folded into an insulin
   conformation [ 561. This raises the question of how much more variability
   in the primary sequence may be tolerated without preventing an
   insulin-like folding to occur and how much of the surface may be varied
   without loss of receptor interaction. The evolutionary diversion of
   relaxins from each other and the possible existence of a common ancestral
   gene for relaxins and insulinsled us to examine the structure of shark
   relaxin. Based on the assumption that sharks have existed in their
   present form for at least 500 million years, i.e., have lived close to
   the point at which fishes and the ancestors of mammals are assumed to
   have branched from each other and where the insulin gene might have
   undergone duplication to give rise to the relaxin gene, we expected to
   observe a closer relation between the relaxin of this quasi-prehistoric
   species and insulins.

AB Oviducal gland morphology, the microscopic organization of the terminal
   zone, and sperm storage were described in the female gummy shark
   (Mustelus antarcticus). Mustelus antarcticus is a nonplacental viviparous
   hound shark, which displays minimal histotrophy during embryonic
   development. The animals examined represented all stages of maturity and
   gestation. The oviducal gland was found to have the same fundamental
   zonation as in most chondrichthyans. Using recent terminology, the
   oviducal gland of chondrichthyans has an anterior club zone, followed by
   a papillary zone, both of which produce jelly that surrounds the egg, a
   baffle zone that elaborates the tertiary egg envelope and a terminal
   zone, where sperm storage occurs. Each zone is composed of simple tubular
   glands that connect to transverse grooves, which extend the full width of
   the gland. The exception is the terminal zone, which does not have
   transverse grooves but consists of individual tubules. The microscopic
   organization and histochemical nature of the zones display similar
   patterns to those of other chondrichthyan genera. Tubules of the terminal
   zone contain four types of cell: ciliated cells, alcian blue-positive
   secretory cells, periodic acid-Schiff and alcian blue-negative secretory
   cells, and secretory columnar cells. These tubules end in recesses, the
   sperm storage tubules, which extend beyond the periphery of the baffle
   zone. Sperm were stored in the sperm storage tubules of all maturing and
   mature animals examined. Of note is the observation of stored sperm in an
   animal 1 year prior to first ovulation. Sperm were also observed
   throughout the uterine sphincter, body of the uterus, isthmus, and
   oviduct of maturing and mature animals, and in the uterine sphincter of
   an immature animal. These sperm represent immediately postcopulation
   aggregations of sperm and sperm in the process of migrating to the site
   of storage or to the site of fertilization. J. Morphol., 2008. © 2008

   when detected. DDTs, HCB and HCHs were only detected in some tissues. The
   ΣTEQ was 5.76 pg/g in muscle. Cadmium mainly accumulated in the pancreas
   and liver (19.6 and 10.7 mg/kg dry wt, respectively); mercury in red
   muscle (4.10–6.91 mg/kg dry wt); selenium in the pancreas (3.57 mg/kg dry

AB Extensive gene duplication is thought to have occurred in the vertebrate
   lineage after it diverged from cephalochordates and before the divergence
   of lobe- and ray-finned fishes, but the exact timing remains obscure.
   This timing was investigated by analysis of the Dlx gene family of a
   representative cartilaginous fish, the leopard shark, Triakis
   semifasciata. Dlx genes encode homeodomain transcription factors and are
   arranged in mammals as three convergently transcribed bigene clusters.
   Six Dlx genes were cloned from Triakis and shown to be orthologous to
   single mammalian Dlx genes. At least four of these are arranged in bigene
   clusters. Phylogenetic analyses of Dlx genes were used to propose an
   evolutionary scenario in which two genome duplications led to four Dlx
   bigene clusters in a common ancestor of jawed vertebrates, one of which
   was lost prior to the diversification of the group. Dlx genes are known
   to be involved in jaw development, and changes in Dlx gene number are
   mapped to the same branch of the vertebrate tree as the origin of jaws.

AB Extremely halophilic archaea were cultivated from smooth and pustular
   microbial mats collected from Hamelin Pool, Shark Bay, Western Australia.
   On the basis of morphology, two phenotypes were present and 16S rRNA gene
   sequence analysis indicated that all strains were most closely related to
   members of the genus Haloferax (98.1–99.4 % similarity). One
   representative strain from each phenotype was selected for further
   taxonomic characterization. Strain SA5T, isolated from the smooth mat,
   formed small (∼1 mm diameter), red, translucent colonies on agar medium
   and strain PA12T, isolated from the pustular mat, formed large (3–5 mm
   diameter), pink, mucoid, domed colonies. Both strains grew in media with
   1.7–5.1 M NaCl, required at least 0.2 M Mg2+ for growth and had pH optima
   of 7.4. The 16S rRNA gene similarity between strains SA5T and PA12T was
   97.1 %. Physiological properties, G+C content and polar lipid composition
   supported placement of both strains in the genus Haloferax. Phenotypic
   analysis indicated that the two strains were distinct from each other and
   from all other members of the genus. This was confirmed by the low
   DNA–DNA relatedness between strains SA5T and PA12T (18–30 %) and between
   both strains and all other recognized Haloferax species. Two novel
   species of the genus Haloferax are proposed to accommodate these novel
   isolates, Haloferax elongans sp. nov. (type strain SA5T=JCM 14791T=ATCC
   BAA-1513T=UNSW 104100T) and Haloferax mucosum sp. nov. (type strain

   potential suitability of marine reserves for its conservation. Of six
   rocky reef habitats available in the study area (sponge gardens,
   artificial structures, barren boulders, sand, sea grass, macroalgae), O.
   ornatus exhibited a significant preference for sponge gardens, artificial
   structures, and barren boulders habitats. Habitat preferences of males
   and females, and individuals 1 m, did not differ. Orectolobus ornatus
   selected daytime resting positions with a high topographic complexity and
   crevice volume and did not select on the basis of prey availability.
   Habitat and microhabitat preferences may be related to the need for
   predator avoidance. Regular monitoring of 40 individually identified O.
   ornatus revealed that none was a permanent resident of the study area.
   Seven individuals exhibited short-term temporary fidelity to the study
   area; they were resighted frequently for part of an intensive 100-day
   survey. Remaining individuals were temporary visitors; they were
   resighted at most once after initial identification or returning after
   extended absences. Monthly population surveys confirmed the turnover of
   O. ornatus in the study area. The lack of long-term site fidelity
   suggests that small marine reserves will be ineffective as a conservation
   strategy for O. ornatus.

AB Gnathiid isopod praniza larvae were found to infect the epaulette shark
   Hemiscyllium ocellatum. All sharks carried larvae on their external body
   surface, with the preferred attachment site in both sexes around the
   cloaca (P<0.05). The claspers were the second site of preference in male
   sharks. Within the buccal and branchial cavities, about 16% of larvae
   were attached to the roof and floor of the mouth and 84% attached to the
   gills. A significant positive correlation existed between larval number
   and fish size. Histological examination showed that larval attachment in
   the buccal cavity elicited variable responses, the most severe being a
   loss of epithelium and compression of underlying tissue. No host cellular
   response or tissue proliferation was observed. Praniza attached
   preferentially to the efferent side of gill filaments (relative to blood
   flow), and caused loss of epithelium, compression of tissue, and a small
   amount of connective tissue proliferation. Attachment to the gill septum
   or to the afferent side of the gill filament caused lamellar disruption,
   a cellular inflammatory response, and connective tissue proliferation.
   Scanning electron microscopy showed little obvious praniza-induced gill
   damage, other than localised tissue distortion to form pockets around
   larvae attached between filaments. The results suggest that praniza
   larvae do not cause sufficient tissue damage to adversely affect the
   health of this shark species.

   shark, Heterodontus francisci, a member of the most basal clade of
   galeomorph sharks, the Heterodontiformes. The accessibility of the food
   was manipulated to determine if the horn shark modulated capture. Three
   different methods of presenting food were used to mimic the different
   positions of prey items found in the natural diet of the horn shark. Food
   was presented unattached to the substrate, securely attached, or fitted
   snugly in a tube. Using high-speed video kinematic analysis, capture
   events were examined. Heterodontus francisci uses inertial suction
   facilitated by rapid mandible depression and labial cartilage protrusion
   to capture food. The horn shark conforms to a capture kinematic profile
   characteristic of both basal and derived inertial suction feeding sharks.
   Unusual post-capture behaviors include body leveraging, use of the mouth
   to form a seal over food, and chisel-like palatoquadrate protrusion. When
   presented with food of different accessibility, Heterodontus francisci
   used one consistent kinematic pattern for capture that was not modulated.
   Only post-capture behaviors varied according to food accessibility.

AB The organisation of the testis of the dogfish shark is technically
   advantageous for stage-by-stage analysis of spermatogenesis in vivo and
   in vitro. Prior studies using this model show that total oestrogen
   receptors (ER) are concentrated in regions where spermatocysts
   (follicle-like germ cell-Sertoli cell units) are in stem cell and
   spermatogonial stages: respectively, germinal zone (GZ) and premeiotic
   (PrM) regions. By contrast, key enzymes regulating oestrogen (E)
   concentrations (aromatase. 17a-hydroxylase) are maximal in meiotic (M)
   and postmeiotic (PoM) regions, respectively, which are upstream in the
   intratesticular vascular pathway. To investigate the hypothesis that E is
   part of a signalling mechanism between stages of development, studies
   were undertaken to test direct effects of oestradiol-17β (E2) on
   processes in ER-rich regions. As measured by [ 3 H]thymidine (-Tdr)
   incorporation, DNA synthesis in GZ and PrM regions was inhibited by E2 (0
   1000 nM) in a dose-response fashion. The maximal response (30-40'Yu) was
   significant, reproducible and observed within 72 hr of treatment. Insulin
   differentially affected DNA synthesis and the response to E2 in GZ and
   PrM regions. As measured by [ 3 H]Tdr release after prelabelling
   spermatocysts of GZ regions, apoptosis progressively decreased with
   increasing concentrations of E2. At the maximal dose of E2 used, there
   was no effect on total protein synthesis or secretion in combined GZ/PrM
   cysts, indicating that effects on DNA synthesis and cell death were
   authentically physiological, not pharmacological, and consistent with a
   state of developmental arrest. These results support the hypothesis that
   E synthesised within the testis is part of a negative feedback regulatory
   mechanism whereby more mature stages regulate the developmental advance
   of less mature stages. A growth control mechanism of this type could
   explain the strict temporal, spatial and quantitative order of succeeding
   stages characteristic of normal spermatogenesis in all vertebrates.
   Further study is required to determine whether E signalling in this model
   is restricted to Sertoli cells or has a germ cell component.

   characterized with respect to their chain composition. Chromatography on
   CM-cellulose of the denatured skin collagens and agarose gel filtration,
   sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and chemical
   analysis of the chromatographic fractions revealed that the two distinct
   subunits, α1 and α2, were present in a molar ratio of about 2 : 1. Thus,
   the chain composition of both lower vertebrate collagens is designated by
   the formula (α1) 2 α2, similar to that of Type I collagen in higher
   vertebrate tissues. However, electrophoresis of the collagens in sodium
   dodecyl sulfate showed mostly a single type of α component. This seems to
   be due to the preferential crosslinking of α1 into β 11 dimers for the
   lamprey collagen and of α2 into β 12 dimers for the shark protein. These
   composite findings indicate that Type I-like collagen is widely
   distributed in the skin of vertebrates ranging from cyclostomes to

   Pair contact during copulation was maintained by the male's left clasper

   left pectoral fin. Results show that reposed sedentary modes of
   copulation are not limited to small species. In a reproductive context,
   biting behavior by male sharks functions as a premating releaser for

AB Before the middle of last century, owing very largely to the prevalence
   of injection as a method of research, the coarse anatomy of the blood
   vascular system drew to itself a considerable measure of attention.
   Amongst the peculiarities of the system that more than others aroused
   interest and speculation during this period, were certain meshworks of
   arteries and veins that formed localised plexuses or retia of fine
   anastomosing vessels. These retia are found upon vessels supplying many
   different regions of the body, and occur somewhat haphazard, in genera
   belonging to practically all the leading groups of Vertebrates. A good
   summary of their distribution will be found in Milne Edwards’ ‘Lecons sur
   la Physiologic,’ vol. 3, 1858; it is sufficient here to point out that
   their structure and composition is far from being similar in all cases
   (Muller, 17, p. 275); and that, although there is noticeable a tendency
   to their formation in aquatic air-breathing animals, both birds and
   mammals, their occurrence depends neither on blood relationship nor on a
   universal similarity of habit, for they are to be found in creatures of
   such different mode of life as fish, birds, ungulates, cetacea, edentates
   and lemurs. It is a remarkable fact that in spite of the curiosity that
   these structures originally aroused, little attention appears to have
   been bestowed upon them for the last fifty or sixty years. This lapse of
   interest may no doubt be attributed to the predominant importance assumed
   in more recent times by purely morphological anatomy, although when
   looked at from a physiological standpoint, there is no question that
   these vascular adaptations are of very considerable interest and deserve
   more study than they have hitherto received.

AB The acquisition of jaws constitutes a landmark event in vertebrate
   evolution, one that in large part potentiated their success and
   diversification. Jaw development and patterning involves an intricate
   spatiotemporal series of reciprocal inductive and responsive interactions
   between the cephalic epithelia and the cranial neural crest (CNC) and
   cephalic mesodermal mesenchyme. The coordinated regulation of these
   interactions is critical for both the ontogenetic registration of the
   jaws and the evolutionary elaboration of variable jaw morphologies and
   designs. Current models of jaw development and evolution have been built
   on molecular and cellular evidence gathered mostly in amniotes such as
   mice, chicks and humans, and augmented by a much smaller body of work on
   the zebrafish. These have been partnered by essential work attempting to
   understand the origins of jaws that has focused on the jawless lamprey.
   Chondrichthyans (cartilaginous fish) are the most distant group to
   amniotes within extant gnathostomes, and comprise the crucial clade
   uniting amniotes and agnathans; yet despite their critical phylogenetic
   position, evidence of the molecular and cellular underpinnings of jaw
   development in chondrichthyans is still lacking. Recent advances in
   genome and molecular developmental biology of the lesser spotted dogfish
   shark, Scyliorhinus canicula, make it ideal for the molecular study of
   chondrichthyan jaw development. Here, following the ‘Hinge and Caps'
   model of jaw development, we have investigated evidence of heterotopic
   (relative changes in position) and heterochronic (relative changes in
   timing) shifts in gene expression, relative to amniotes, in the jaw
   primordia of S. canicula embryos. We demonstrate the presence of clear
   proximo-distal polarity in gene expression patterns in the shark embryo,
   thus establishing a baseline molecular bauplan for branchial arch-derived
   jaw development and further validating the utility of the ‘Hinge and
   Caps’ model in comparative studies of jaw development and evolution.
   Moreover, we correlate gene expression patterns with the absence of a
   lambdoidal junction (formed where the maxillary first arch meets the
   frontonasal processes) in chondrichthyans, further highlighting the
   importance of this region for the development and evolution of jaw
   structure in advanced gnathostomes.

AB SUMMARY Bull sharks, Carcharhinus leucas , are one of only a few species
   of elasmobranchs that live in both marine and freshwater environments.
   Osmoregulation in euryhaline elasmobranchs is achieved through the
   control and integration of various organs (kidney, rectal gland and
   liver) in response to changes in environmental salinity. However, little
   is known regarding the mechanisms of ion transport in the gills of
   euryhaline elasmobranchs and how they are affected by osmoregulatory
   challenges. This study was conducted to gain insight into the branchial
   ion and acid-base regulatory mechanisms of C. leucas by identifying
   putative ion transporters and determining whether their expression is
   influenced by environmental salinity. We hypothesised that expression
   levels of the Na + /K + -ATPase (NKA) pump, Na + /H + exchanger 3 (NHE3),
   vacuolar-type H + -ATPase (VHA) and anion exchanger pendrin (PDN) would
   be upregulated in freshwater (FW) C. leucas . Immunohistochemistry was
   used to localise all four ion transporters in gills of bull sharks
   captured in both FW and estuarine/seawater (EST/SW) environments. NHE3
   immunoreactivity occurred in the apical region of cells with basolateral
   NKA expression whereas PDN was apically expressed in cells that also
   exhibited basolateral VHA immunoreactivity. In accordance with our
   hypotheses, quantitative real-time PCR showed that the mRNA expression of
   NHE3 and NKA was significantly upregulated in gills of FW-captured C.
   leucas relative to EST/SW-captured animals. These data suggest that NHE3
   and NKA together may be important in mediating branchial Na + uptake in
   freshwater environments, whereas PDN and VHA might contribute to Cl -
   /HCO 3 - transport in marine and freshwater bull shark gills.

   between mercury and selenium in blue sharks. High levels of mercury were

   are above the allowed 1.0 μg/g for human consumption. The mercury to
   selenium molar ratio was 1:0.2. We found a low correlation between
   mercury bioaccumulation and shark size. Juveniles have lower
   concentrations of mercury than adults. Regarding the analyzed prey, the
   main prey of the blue shark, pelagic red crab, Pleuroncodes planipes,
   bioaccumulated 0.04 ± 0.01 μg/g Hg wet weight, but the prey with higher
   bioaccumulation was the bullet fish Auxis spp. (0.20 ± 0.02 μg/g wet
   weight). In terms of volume, the red crab P. planipes can be the prey
   that provides high levels of mercury to the blue shark.

AB Most sharks, rays and chimaeras (chondrichthyans) taken in commercial
   fisheries are discarded (i.e. returned to the ocean either dead or
   alive). Quantifying the post-capture survival (PCS) of discarded species
   is therefore essential for the improved management and conservation of
   this group. For all chondrichthyans taken in the main shark fishery of
   Australia, we quantified the immediate PCS of individuals reaching the
   deck of commercial shark gillnet fishing vessels and applied a risk-based
   method to semi-quantitatively determine delayed and total PCS. Estimates
   of immediate, delayed and total PCS were consistent, being very high for
   the most commonly discarded species (Port Jackson shark, Australian
   swellshark, and spikey dogfish) and low for the most important commercial
   species (gummy and school sharks). Increasing gillnet soak time or water
   temperature significantly decreased PCS. Chondrichthyans with
   bottom-dwelling habits had the highest PCS whereas those with pelagic
   habits had the lowest PCS. The risk-based approach can be easily
   implemented as a standard practice of on-board observing programs,
   providing a convenient first-step assessment of the PCS of all species
   taken in commercial fisheries.

AB The elasmobranch fish are an ancient, evolutionarily successful, but
   under-researched vertebrate group, particularly in regard to their recent
   evolutionary history. Their lineage has survived four mass extinction
   events and most present day taxa are thought to be derived from Mesozoic
   forms. Here we present a molecular phylogenetic analysis of the family
   Orectolobidae that provides evidence for recent events of diversification
   in this shark group. Species interrelationships in Orectolobidae were
   reconstructed based on four mitochondrial and nuclear genes. In line with
   previous morphological work, our results do not support current taxonomic
   arrangements in Orectolobidae and indicate that a taxonomic revision of
   the family is warranted. We propose that the onset of diversification of
   orectolobid sharks is of Miocene age and occurred within the
   Indo-Australian region. Surprisingly, we also find evidence for a recent
   (∼last 2 million years) and rapid radiation of wobbegong sharks.
   Allopatric speciation followed by range expansion seems like the general
   most likely explanation to account for wobbegong relationships and
   distributions. We suggest that the evolution of this shark group was
   mostly influenced by two temporal scenarios of diversification. The
   oldest relates to major geological changes in the Indo-West Pacific
   associated with the Miocene collision of the Indo-Australian and Eurasian
   plates. The most recent scenario was influenced by changes in
   oceanography and the emergence of biogeographic barriers related to
   Pleistocene glacial cycles in Australian waters.

AB Information on the fine-scale movement of predators and their prey is
   important to interpret foraging behaviours and activity patterns. An
   understanding of these behaviours will help determine predator-prey
   relationships and their effects on community dynamics. For instance
   understanding a predator's movement behaviour may alter pre determined
   expectations of prey behaviour, as almost any aspect of the prey's
   decisions from foraging to mating can be influenced by the risk of
   predation. Acoustic telemetry was used to study the fine-scale movement
   patterns of the Broadnose Sevengill shark Notorynchus cepedianus and its
   main prey, the Gummy shark Mustelus antarcticus, in a coastal bay of
   southeast Tasmania. Notorynchus cepedianus displayed distinct diel
   differences in activity patterns. During the day they stayed close to the
   substrate (sea floor) and were frequently inactive. At night, however,
   their swimming behaviour continually oscillated through the water column
   from the substrate to near surface. In contrast, M. antarcticus remained
   close to the substrate for the entire diel cycle, and showed similar
   movement patterns for day and night. For both species, the possibility
   that movement is related to foraging behaviour is discussed. For M.
   antarcticus, movement may possibly be linked to a diet of predominantly
   slow benthic prey. On several occasions, N. cepedianus carried out a
   sequence of burst speed events (increased rates of movement) that could
   be related to chasing prey. All burst speed events during the day were
   across the substrate, while at night these occurred in the water column.
   Overall, diel differences in water column use, along with the presence of
   oscillatory behaviour and burst speed events suggest that N. cepedianus
   are nocturnal foragers, but may opportunistically attack prey they happen
   to encounter during the day.

AB : Recent average annual catches of sharks by tuna longline vessels
   fishing in the Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI) are estimated to be
   between 1583 and 2274 t. Although 22 shark species have been recorded by
   the observer programme for this fishery, 80% of the annual catch
   comprises only five species: blue shark Prionace glauca, silky shark
   Carcharhinus falciformis, bigeye thresher shark Alopias superciliosus,
   pelagic thresher shark Alopias pelagicus and oceanic whitetip shark
   Carcharhinus longimanus. Wire leaders (i.e. branch lines or traces) were
   also used by nearly all observed vessels. Generalized additive model
   (GAM)-based analyses of catch rates indicated that P. glauca and A.
   superciliosus are caught in higher numbers when vessels fish in
   relatively cooler waters, at night, close to the full moon, when the 27°
   C thermocline is close to the surface and during El Nino conditions. In
   contrast, C. falciformis, A. pelagicus and C. longimanus are caught in
   higher numbers when shark lines are used (all three species) or hooks are
   set at a shallow depth (A. pelagicus and C. longimanus and, also, P.
   glauca). These findings are generally consistent with current knowledge
   of these species' habitat preferences, movement and distribution. The
   results of these analyses were combined with information pertaining to
   shark condition and fate upon capture to compare the likely effectiveness
   of a range of potential measures for reducing shark mortality in the
   longline fishery. Of the options considered, the most effective would be
   to combine measures that reduce the catch rate (e.g. restrictions on the
   use of wire leaders, shark baits and shark lines) with measures that
   increase survival rates after post-capture release (e.g. finning bans).

   (FE). The lowest foam stability (FS) was obtained when gelatin was
   extracted at 75 °C (P < 0.05). The BBS gelatin had lower EAI, ESI, and FE
   than did BTS gelatin. Nevertheless, a higher FS was found in the former
   (P < 0.05). Antioxidative activities of both gelatins increased with
   coincidental increase in α-amino group content as the extraction
   temperature increased (P < 0.05). The BTS gelatin generally exhibited the
   higher antioxidative activities, compared with the BBS gelatin (P <
   0.05). Gelatin extracted at 60 °C showed the highest interfacial
   properties, while those extracted at higher temperature (75 °C) had
   enhanced antioxidative activities. Extraction temperature may therefore
   be regulated to maximize applications.

AB The remote sub-Arctic/Arctic environment has due to human activities
   become a sink for organohalogen contaminants (OHCs). These OHC include
   traditional contaminants such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), DDTs
   and technical mixtures of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), all
   included in the Stockholm Convention list of persistent organic
   pollutants (POPs). Other OHCs, currently under evaluation to be included
   among the POPs i.e. short chain chlorinated paraffins (SCCPs) and
   hexabromocyclododecane (HBCDD) are also found in these environments as
   well as a whole range of other OHCs. The main objective of this thesis is
   to increase the knowledge about the presence of OHCs in a high trophic
   Arctic shark species, the Greenland shark (Somniosus microcephalus). The
   Greenland shark is an opportunistic feeder, occasionally feeding at the
   top of the Arctic marine food chain. Furthermore may this species have a
   life span in excess of 100 years and is probably among the oldest of any
   fish species. These traits make the shark prone to accumulate elevated
   concentrations of OHCs. This has shown to be true for the Greenland
   sharks studied and most of the targeted OHCs were determined in the
   species. The highest concentrations were observed for the DDTs, ranging
   up to 26 μg/g fat. Other OHCs reported that are of special interest are
   SCCPs and brominated flame retardants used as replacement products to
   PBDEs; pentabromoethylbenzene (PBEB) and
   1,2-bis(2,4,6-tribromophenoxy)ethane (BTBPE). Also a range of OHCs whose
   origin is assumed to be natural, were shown to be present in Greenland
   sharks. This thesis is stressing the fact that even though the use of
   certain OHCs has been banned for decades they are still present at high
   concentrations in the deep waters of the Arctic. Therefore it is of major
   importance to continue to monitor the fate of traditional and emerging
   OHCs in the environment, and for this purpose the Greenland shark is an
   excellent species.

   (NDL) PCBs in muscle and liver from 10 female Greenland sharks collected
   between 2001 and 2003 from Icelandic waters. The mean total
   concentrations of PCDDs/Fs were 13 and 530 pg/g fat for muscle and liver,
   respectively, and show enrichment in the liver. Concentrations of DL-non-
   ortho PCBs were also higher in liver compared to muscle with mean
   concentrations of 7.8 and 0.36 ng/g fat, respectively. No enrichment in
   the liver was found for DL-mono- ortho - and NDL-PCBs. No correlation was
   found between the size range studied and total concentrations of the
   compounds analyzed. Total WHO-TEQs (PCDDs/Fs and DL-PCBs) ranged between
   7.1–70 and 54–1500 pg/g fat in muscle and liver, respectively.

AB Bite damage patterns have long been used to estimate shark species and
   body size, with somewhat limited success. The lack of fit between damage
   patterns and shark size is partially due to variation in tooth size and
   shape within an individual. The ability to accurately predict body size
   from bite patterns is important for better understanding the ecological
   and behavioral underpinnings of shark bites/attacks on marine organisms,
   humans, and submarine equipment. To this end, we measured interdental
   distance (IDD) between the most labial teeth in the first six tooth files
   on both the upper and lower jaws, as well as the circumference of the
   portion of each jaw that bears teeth, for prepared jaw sets from fourteen
   shark species and regressed these data against total length. IDD is
   allometric as well as an accurate predictor of total length in all
   species examined, except Carcharhinus acronotus. Tooth-bearing
   circumference is also allometric and predictive of total length in all
   species. Though considerable overlap exists in IDD and circumference
   ranges among species for the total length ranges examined, Carcharodon
   carcharias and Isurus sp. can be differentiated from Carcharhinus
   limbatus, Carcharhinus brevipinna, and C. acronotus based on these values
   alone. When combined with knowledge of species-specific feeding behavior,
   geographic distribution, and habitat preferences, these simple measures
   from bite damage patterns allow quick, accurate assessment of shark size
   and potential species.

AB Sandbar sharks, Carcharhinus plumbeus, collected from commercial shark
   fisheries in Western Australia were aged by examination of sectioned
   vertebrae and analysis of tag-recapture data. Growth curves were derived
   from consensus counts of growth bands from the vertebrae of 238
   individuals ranging in size between 47 and 154 cm fork length (FL). The
   annual periodicity of growth band formation was validated using vertebrae
   from tagged sharks, which were injected with oxytetracycline (n = 9) and
   calcein (n = 23) and were at liberty for up to 8.1 years. The oldest
   female was estimated to be 25 years of age and the oldest male was 19
   years. The ages at which 50% of female and male sharks were mature were
   estimated to be 16.2 and 13.8 years, respectively. Growth increment data
   from 104 tagged C. plumbeus, which were at liberty for up to 7.4 years,
   were used to construct growth curves for comparison with those derived
   from vertebral analysis. The two methods yielded noticeably different
   results. Based on a known size at birth of 42.5 cm FL, von Bertalanffy
   parameters estimated using length at age data from vertebral analysis
   were: K = 0.039 year−1 and L ∞ = 245.8 cm; K = 0.044 year−1 and L ∞ =
   226.3 cm; and K = 0.040 year− and L∞ = 239.6 cm for females, males and
   both sexes combined. The von Bertalanffy parameters derived from
   tag-recapture data were: K = 0.153 year−1 and L ∞ = 142.0 cm for combined
   sexes. However, as sharks longer than 142.0 cm were commonly encountered
   during sampling, these estimates appear to be biologically unrealistic.
   Also, given the high variability in growth rates of tagged sharks,
   compared to those derived from the larger vertebral analysis dataset,
   vertebral ageing was concluded to provide a better description of age and
   growth in this study. These results confirm that C. plumbeus is a
   slow-growing and late maturing species and thus recovery times from
   periods of overexploitation would be considerable.

AB Microbial deposits at Shark Bay constitute a diverse living microbial
   carbonate system, developed in a semi-arid, highly evaporative marine
   setting. Three tidal flats located in different embayments within the
   World Heritage area were investigated in order to compare microbial
   deposits and their Holocene evolution. The stressing conditions in the
   intertidal–subtidal environment have produced a microbial ecosystem that
   is trapping, binding and biologically inducing CaCO3 precipitation,
   producing laminated stromatolites (tufted, smooth and colloform),
   non-laminated thrombolitic forms (pustular) and cryptomicrobial
   non-laminated forms (microbial pavement). A general shallowing-upwards
   sedimentary cycle was recognized and correlated with Holocene sea-level
   variations, where microbial deposits constitute the younger (2360 years
   bp) and shallower sedimentary veneer. In addition, sediments have been
   documented with evidence of exposure during the Holocene, from 1040 to
   940 14C years bp, when sea-level was apparently lower than present.
   Filamentous bacteria constitute the dominant group in the blister, tufted
   and smooth mat types, and coccus bacteria dominate the pustular,
   colloform and microbial pavement deposit types. In the subtidal
   environment within colloform and pavement structures, microbial
   communities coexist with organisms such as bivalves, serpulids, diatoms,
   green algae (Acetabularia), crustaceans, foraminifera and
   micro-gastropods, which are responsible for exoskeleton supply and
   extensive bioturbation. The internal fabric of the microbial deposits is
   laminated, sub-laminar, scalloped, irregular or clotted, depending on the
   amount of fine-grained carbonate and the natural ability of microbial
   communities to trap and bind particles or induce carbonate precipitation.
   Nilemah tidal flat contains the thickest (1·3 m) and best-developed
   microbial sedimentary system; its deposition pre-dated the Rocky Point
   and Garden Point tidal flats, with the most positive isotope values for
   δ13C and δ18O, reflecting strong microbial activity in a highly
   evaporative environment. There is an evolutionary series preserved within
   the tidal flats reflecting relative ages and degree of salinity
   elevation.

AB White sharks are highly migratory and segregate by sex, age and size.
   Unlike marine mammals, they neither surface to breathe nor frequent
   haul-out sites, hindering generation of abundance data required to
   estimate population size. A recent tag-recapture study used photographic
   identifications of white sharks at two aggregation sites to estimate
   abundance in “central California” at 219 mature and sub-adult
   individuals. They concluded this represented approximately one-half of
   the total abundance of mature and sub-adult sharks in the entire eastern
   North Pacific Ocean (ENP). This low estimate generated great concern
   within the conservation community, prompting petitions for governmental
   endangered species designations. We critically examine that study and
   find violations of model assumptions that, when considered in total, lead
   to population underestimates. We also use a Bayesian mixture model to
   demonstrate that the inclusion of transient sharks, characteristic of
   white shark aggregation sites, would substantially increase abundance
   estimates for the adults and sub-adults in the surveyed sub-population.
   Using a dataset obtained from the same sampling locations and widely
   accepted demographic methodology, our analysis indicates a minimum
   all-life stages population size of >2000 individuals in the California
   subpopulation is required to account for the number and size range of
   individual sharks observed at the two sampled sites. Even accounting for
   methodological and conceptual biases, an extrapolation of these data to
   estimate the white shark population size throughout the ENP is
   inappropriate. The true ENP white shark population size is likely
   several-fold greater as both our study and the original published
   estimate exclude non-aggregating sharks and those that independently
   aggregate at other important ENP sites. Accurately estimating the central
   California and ENP white shark population size requires methodologies
   that account for biases introduced by sampling a limited number of sites
   and that account for all life history stages across the species' range of
   habitats.

   relatively large genomes (3.8–6.7 Gbp) contain sparse distributions of
   coding genes and regulatory elements and exhibit reduced molecular

AB The granule cell layer of the cerebellum comprises the largest population
   of neurons in the vertebrate CNS. In amniotes, its precursors undergo a
   unique phase of transit amplification, regulated by Sonic hedgehog. They
   do so within a prominent but transient secondary proliferative
   epithelium, the external germinal layer, which is formed by tangential
   migration of precursor cells from the rhombic lip. This behavior is a
   hallmark of bird and mammal cerebellum development. Despite its
   significance for both development and disease, it is unclear whether an
   external germinal layer is a requirement for granule cell production or
   an expedient of transit amplification. Evidence for its existence in more
   basal vertebrates is contradictory. We therefore examined cerebellum
   development in the zebrafish, specifically in relation to the expression
   of the basic helix–loop–helix gene Atonal 1 , which definitively
   characterizes granule cell precursors. The expression of Atoh1a–Atoh1c ,
   in combination with patterns of proliferation and fate maps, define
   precursor pools at the rhombic lip and cerebellar midline but demonstrate
   that an external germinal layer is absent. Sonic hedgehog signaling is
   correspondingly absent in the zebrafish cerebellum. Sustained
   roof-plate-derived signals suggest that, in the absence of transit
   amplification, primary granule cell precursor pools are maintained
   throughout development. To determine whether this pattern is specific to
   zebrafish or reflects a more general anamniote organization, we examined
   the expression of similar genes in the dogfish, Scylliorhinus canicula .
   We show that these anamniotes share a common ground plan of granule cell
   production that does not include an external germinal layer.

AB It is now well established that there were four Hox gene clusters in the
   genome of the last common ancestor of extant gnathostomes. To better
   understand the evolution of the organization and expression of these
   genomic regions, we have studied the Hox gene clusters of a shark
   (Scyliorhinus canicula). We sequenced 225,580 expressed sequence tags
   from several embryonic cDNA libraries. Blast searches identified
   corresponding transcripts to almost all the HoxA, HoxB, and HoxD cluster
   genes. No HoxC transcript was identified, suggesting that this cluster is
   absent or highly degenerate. Using Hox gene sequences as probes, we
   selected and sequenced seven clones from a bacterial artificial
   chromosome library covering the complete region of the three gene
   clusters. Mapping of cDNAs to these genomic sequences showed extensive
   alternative splicing and untranslated exon sharing between neighboring
   Hox genes. Homologous noncoding exons could not be identified in
   transcripts from other species using sequence similarity. However, by
   comparing conserved noncoding sequences upstream of these exons in
   different species, we were able to identify homology between some exons.
   Some alternative splicing variants are probably very ancient and were
   already coded for by the ancestral Hox gene cluster. We also identified
   several transcripts that do not code for Hox proteins, are probably not
   translated, and all but one are in the reverse orientation to the Hox
   genes. This survey of the transcriptome of the Hox gene clusters of a
   shark shows that the high complexity observed in mammals is a gnathostome
   ancestral feature.

AB Abstract Despite the importance of observers to collect data for
   effective fisheries management worldwide, their species-identification
   abilities are rarely assessed. Misidentifications could compromise
   observer data particularly in diverse, multi-species fisheries such as
   those in the tropics where visual identification is challenging. Here, we
   provide the first estimates of the ability of scientific observers to
   identify five species of morphologically similar carcharhinid sharks
   (Carcharhinus leucas, C. amboinensis, C. tilstoni, C. sorrah and C.
   brevipinna) in a fishery in northern Australia. We compared observer
   field identifications of sharks with genetic validation (814 bp mtDNA
   NADH dehydrogenase subunit 4) to quantify species identification errors.
   We used binomial generalised linear models to determine the influences of
   species, gender, total length, and the observer's experience on
   identification error. We found that identification error (∼20%) depended
   predominately on the species in question (highest error for C. tilstoni).
   Male sharks were misidentified less frequently than females, and error
   decreased marginally with increasing total length. Surprisingly, we found
   no statistical evidence that observer experience influenced
   identification error. Our results provide the first benchmark of
   identification accuracy of observers for carcharhinid sharks in northern
   Australia and show that estimates of error in species identifications
   need to be incorporated into management strategies to ensure successful
   recovery of the many recently over-fished shark populations.

AB Sharks and rays are highly sensitive to chemical stimuli in their natural
   environment but several hypotheses predict that hammerhead sharks, with
   their expanded head and enlarged olfactory epithelium, have particularly
   acute olfactory systems. We used the electro-olfactogram (EOG) technique
   to compare the relative response of the scalloped hammerhead shark
   (Sphyrna lewini) olfactory epithelium to 20 proteinogenic amino acids and
   determine the sensitivity for 6 amino acids. At micromolar
   concentrations, cysteine evoked the greatest EOG response which was
   approximately twice as large as that of alanine. The weakest response was
   obtained for proline followed by aspartic acid and isoleucine. The
   olfactory epithelium showed adaptation to sequential stimulation, and
   recovery was related to the inter-stimulus time period. Estimated EOG
   response thresholds were in the sub-nanomolar range for both alanine (9.2
   × 10−11 M) and cysteine (8.4 × 10−10 M) and in the micromolar range for
   proline and serine. These thresholds from 10−10 to 10−6 M for the
   scalloped hammerhead shark are comparable or lower than those reported
   for other teleost and elasmobranch species. Future work should focus on
   binary and more complex compounds to test for competition and
   cross-adaptation for different classes of peripheral receptors, and their
   responses to molecules found in biologically relevant stimuli.

AB The nurse shark, Ginglymostoma cirratum, inhabits shallow, tropical, and
   subtropical waters in the Atlantic and the eastern Pacific. Unlike many
   other species of sharks, nurse sharks are remarkably sedentary. We
   assayed the mitochondrial control region and eight microsatellite loci
   from individuals collected primarily in the western Atlantic to estimate
   the degree of population subdivision. Two individuals from the eastern
   Atlantic and one from the Pacific coast of Panama also were genotyped.
   Overall, the mtDNA haplotype (h = 48 ± 5%) and nucleotide (π = 0.08 ±
   0.06%) diversities were low. The microsatellite data mirror the
   mitochondrial results with the average number of alleles (\( \bar{N}_{A}
   \) = 9) and observed heterozygosity (\( \bar{H}_{O} \) = 0.58) both low.
   The low levels of diversity seen in both the mtDNA and the microsatellite
   may be due to historical sea level fluctuations and concomitant loss of
   shallow water habitat. Eight of the 10 pair-wise western Atlantic F ST
   estimates for mtDNA indicated significant genetic subdivision. Pair-wise
   F ST values for the microsatellite loci indicated a similar pattern as
   the mtDNA. The western Atlantic population of nurse sharks is genetically
   subdivided with the strongest separation seen between the offshore
   islands and mainland Brazil, likely due to deep water acting as a barrier
   to dispersal. The eastern and western Atlantic populations were closely
   related. The eastern Pacific individual is quite different from Atlantic
   individuals and may be a cryptic, sister species.

AB Sharks and other cartilaginous fish are the phylogenetically oldest
   living organisms that rely on antibodies as part of their adaptive immune
   system. They produce the immunoglobulin new antigen receptor (IgNAR), a
   homodimeric heavy chain-only antibody, as a major part of their humoral
   adaptive immune response. Here, we report the atomic resolution structure
   of the IgNAR constant domains and a structural model of this heavy
   chain-only antibody. We find that despite low sequence conservation, the
   basic Ig fold of modern antibodies is already present in the evolutionary
   ancient shark IgNAR domains, highlighting key structural determinants of
   the ubiquitous Ig fold. In contrast, structural differences between human
   and shark antibody domains explain the high stability of several IgNAR
   domains and allowed us to engineer human antibodies for increased
   stability and secretion efficiency. We identified two constant domains,
   C1 and C3, that act as dimerization modules within IgNAR. Together with
   the individual domain structures and small-angle X-ray scattering, this
   allowed us to develop a structural model of the complete IgNAR molecule.
   Its constant region exhibits an elongated shape with flexibility and a
   characteristic kink in the middle. Despite the lack of a canonical hinge
   region, the variable domains are spaced appropriately wide for binding to
   multiple antigens. Thus, the shark IgNAR domains already display the
   well-known Ig fold, but apart from that, this heavy chain-only antibody
   employs unique ways for dimerization and positioning of functional
   modules.

AB Microbialites are organosedimentary structures that are formed through
   the interaction of benthic microbial communities and sediments and
   include mineral precipitation. These lithifying microbial mat structures
   include stromatolites and thrombolites. Exuma Sound in the Bahamas, and
   Hamelin Pool in Shark Bay, Western Australia, are two locations where
   significant stands of modern microbialites exist. Although prokaryotic
   diversity in these structures is reasonably well documented, little is
   known about the eukaryotic component of these communities and their
   potential to influence sedimentary fabrics through grazing, binding and
   burrowing activities. Accordingly, comparisons of eukaryotic communities
   in modern stromatolitic and thrombolitic mats can potentially provide
   insight into the coexistence of both laminated and clotted mat structures
   in close proximity to one another. Here we examine this possibility by
   comparing eukaryotic diversity based on Sanger and high-throughput
   pyrosequencing of small subunit ribosomal RNA (18S rRNA) genes. Analyses
   were based on total RNA extracts as template to minimize input from
   inactive or deceased organisms. Results identified diverse eukaryotic
   communities particularly stramenopiles, Alveolata, Metazoa, Amoebozoa and
   Rhizaria within different mat types at both locations, as well as
   abundant and diverse signatures of eukaryotes with <80% sequence
   similarity to sequences in GenBank. This suggests the presence of
   significant novel eukaryotic diversity, particularly in hypersaline
   Hamelin Pool. There was evidence of vertical structuring of protist
   populations and foraminiferal diversity was highest in
   bioturbated/clotted thrombolite mats of Highborne Cay.

AB Abstract Studying modern microbial mats can provide insights into how
   microbial communities interact with biogeochemical cycles.
   High-resolution, two-dimensional distributions of porewater analytes were
   determined in the upper three layers of a modern microbial mat from
   Nilemah, Shark Bay, Western Australia, using colorimetric diffusive
   equilibration in thin film (DET) and diffusive gradients in thin film
   (DGT) techniques. The colorimetric DET and DGT techniques were used to
   investigate the co-distributions of sulfide, iron(II), and phosphate and
   the alkalinity. Two-dimensional distributions of sulfide, iron(II) and
   phosphate showed a high degree of spatial heterogeneity under both light
   and dark conditions. However, average concentration profiles showed a
   clear shift in overall redox conditions between light and dark
   conditions. During light deployments, iron(II) and sulfide concentrations
   were generally low throughout the entire microbial mat. In contrast,
   during dark deployments, when anoxic conditions prevailed, higher
   concentrations of iron(II) and sulfide were observed and the sulfide
   boundary migrated towards the upper layer of the mat. Similar to the
   iron(II) profile, the phosphate profile showed an increase in
   concentration at night, suggesting that phosphate was released through
   the dissolution of iron–phosphate complexes under anoxic conditions.
   However, two-dimensional distributions revealed that hot spots of
   phosphate and iron(II) did not coincide, suggesting that porewater
   phosphate was mainly regulated by diel metabolic changes in the mat.
   Alkalinity profiles also demonstrated an increase in concentration at
   night, probably related to high rates of sulfate reduction under dark
   conditions. Complimentary microelectrode measurements of oxygen and
   sulfide confirmed that light-limited microbial communities play a
   significant role in regulating porewater solute concentrations,
   especially through photosynthetic activity that supports rapid
   re-oxidation of sulfide during the day. Sulfide was not detected in the
   upper layers (ca. 4 mm) of the mat by microelectrode measurements, but
   was found at those depths by the time-integrated DGT measurements.
   Complimentary silver foil deployments also showed a 2D distribution of
   sulfate-reducing activity occurring under oxic conditions in the top
   layers. DGT, O 2 and sulfide microelectrode profiles and silver foils
   confirmed hotspots of sulfide production coinciding with cyanobacterial
   photosynthesis. Two-dimensional porewater analyte distributions showed
   significant small-scale heterogeneity, highlighting the complexity of
   such dynamic ecosystems and the advantage of two-dimensional methods.

   Samples (20– 50 individuals per location) were collected off Ireland,
   Portugal, Madeira, Mauritania, South Africa, and the Azores (Mid-Atlantic
   Ridge). High levels of genetic diversity were found at the nuclear
   microsatellite loci (mean A ¼ 17.3; overall Ho ¼ 0.77), although there
   was low diversity at the mtDNA CR (h ¼ 0.65, p ¼ 0.0018). Genetic
   diversity for the Portuguese dogfish was homogeneously distributed among
   sampling locations, resulting in low and non-significant indices of
   genetic differentiation (e.g. FST ¼ 20.0013 to 0.0096, FST ¼ 20.017 to
   0.033; p . 0.5), consistent with the absence of population structure
   within the area sampled. The results indicate that C. coelolepis has a
   high dispersal potential within the eastern Atlantic, and its apparent
   spatial segregation by size and maturity stage suggest large-scale
   migration associated with the reproductive cycle.

   different luminous zones was followed, and photophore maturation was
   marked by the appearance of green fluorescent vesicles inside the

   spinax to produce light was linked to the presence of these fluorescent
   vesicles and occured prior to birth. The size of photogenic organs, as
   well as the percentage of ventral body surface area occupied by the

AB Ocean acidification, resulting from increasing anthropogenic CO 2
   emissions, is predicted to affect the physiological perfor mance of many
   marine species. Recent studies have shown substantial reductions in
   aerobic performance in some teleost fish species, but no change or even
   enhanced performance in others. Notably lacking, however, are studies on
   the effects of nearfuture CO2 conditions on larger meso and apex
   predators, such as elasmobranchs. The epaulette shark (Hemiscyllium
   ocellatum) lives on shallow coral reef flats and in lagoons, where it may
   frequently encounter short-term periods of environmental hypoxia and
   elevated CO2, especially during nocturnal low tides. Indeed, H. ocellatum
   is remarkably tolerant to short periods (hours) of hypoxia, and possibly
   hypercapnia, but nothing is known about its response to prolonged
   exposure. We exposed H. ocellatum individuals to control (390 µatm) or
   one of two near-future CO2 treatments (600 or 880 µatm) for a minimum of
   60 days and then measured key aspects of their respiratory physiology,
   namely the resting oxygen consumption rate, which is used to estimate
   resting metabolic rate, and critical oxygen tension, a proxy for hypoxia
   sensitivity. Neither of these respiratory attributes was affected by the
   long-term exposure to elevated CO 2. Furthermore, there was no change in
   citrate synthase activity, a cellular indicator of aerobic energy
   production. Plasma bicarbonate concentrations were significantly elevated
   in sharks exposed to 600 and 880 µatm CO2 treatments, indicating that
   acidosis was probably prevented by regulatory changes in acid–base
   relevant ions. Epaulette sharks may therefore possess adaptations that
   confer tolerance to CO2 levels projected to occur in the ocean by the end
   of this century. It remains uncertain whether other elasmobranchs,
   especially pelagic species that do not experience such diurnal
   fluctuations in their environment, will be equally tolerant.

AB The nurse shark, Ginglymostoma cirratum, is an obligate suction feeder
   that preys on benthic inverte- brates and fish. Its cranial morphology
   exhibits a suite of structural and functional modifications that
   facilitate this mode of prey capture. During suction-feeding, subambient
   pressure is generated by the ventral expansion of the hyoid apparatus and
   the floor of its buccopharyngeal cavity. As in suction-feeding bony
   fishes, the nurse shark exhibits ex- pansive, compressive, and recovery
   kinematic phases that produce posterior-directed water flow through the
   bucco- pharyngeal cavity. However, there is generally neither a
   preparatory phase nor cranial elevation. Suction is gener- ated by the
   rapid depression of the buccopharyngeal floor by the coracoarcualis,
   coracohyoideus, and coracobran- chiales muscles. Because the hyoid arch
   of G. cirratum is loosely connected to the mandible, contraction of the
   rectus cervicis muscle group can greatly depress the floor of the
   buccopharyngeal cavity below the depressed mandible, resulting in large
   volumetric expansion. Suction pressures in the nurse shark vary greatly,
   but include the greatest subambient pressures reported for an
   aquatic-feeding ver- tebrate. Maximum suction pressure does not appear to
   be related to shark size, but is correlated with the rate of buc-
   copharyngeal expansion. As in suction-feeding bony fishes, suction in the
   nurse shark is only effective within approxi- mately 3 cm in front of the
   mouth. The foraging behavior of this shark is most likely constrained to
   ambushing or stalking due to the exponential decay of effective suction
   in front of the mouth. Prey capture may be facilitated by for- aging
   within reef confines and close to the substrate, which can enhance the
   effective suction distance, or by foraging at night when it can more
   closely approach prey. J. Mor-

AB There is increasing concern for the conservation of sharks among
   scientists, environmental conservation advocates, and the interested
   public, but misunderstanding among policy non-specialists about which
   conservation and management policies are available, and which might work
   best for certain situations, persists. Here we present a review of
   fisheries management and conservation literature relating to sharks.
   Policies are broadly divided into target-based policies that aim for
   sustainable fisheries exploitation (e.g. fisheries quotas) and
   limit-based policies that aim to prevent all fisheries exploitation of
   entire taxa (e.g. marine reserves). A list of the pros and cons of each
   policy is included, as is a decision tree to aid in selection of the most
   appropriate policy. Our goal is that this paper will allow policy
   non-specialists, including scientists without policy training,
   environmental activists, and concerned citizens, to make informed
   decisions when advocating for shark conservation.

AB Elucidating how mobile ocean predators utilize the pelagic environment is
   vital to understanding the dynamics of oceanic species and ecosystems.
   Pop-up archival transmitting (PAT) tags have emerged as an important tool
   to describe animal migrations in oceanic environments where direct
   observation is not feasible. Available PAT tag data, however, are for the
   most part limited to geographic position, swimming depth and
   environmental temperature, making effective behavioral observation
   challenging. However, novel analysis approaches have the potential to
   extend the interpretive power of these limited observations. Here we
   developed an approach based on clustering analysis of PAT daily
   time-at-depth histogram records to distinguish behavioral modes in white
   sharks (Carcharodon carcharias). We found four dominant and distinctive
   behavioral clusters matching previously described behavioral patterns,
   including two distinctive offshore diving modes. Once validated, we
   mapped behavior mode occurrence in space and time. Our results
   demonstrate spatial, temporal and sex-based structure in the diving
   behavior of white sharks in the northeastern Pacific previously
   unrecognized including behavioral and migratory patterns resembling those
   of species with lek mating systems. We discuss our findings, in
   combination with available life history and environmental data, and
   propose specific testable hypotheses to distinguish between mating and
   foraging in northeastern Pacific white sharks that can provide a
   framework for future work. Our methodology can be applied to similar
   datasets from other species to further define behaviors during
   unobservable phases.

AB The velvet belly lantern shark (Etmopterus spinax) emits a blue
   luminescence from thousands of tiny photophores. In this work, we
   performed a pharmacological study to determine the physiological control
   of luminescence from these luminous organs. Isolated photophore-filled
   skin patches produced light under melatonin (MT) and prolactin (PRL)
   stimulation in a dose-dependent manner but did not react to classical
   neurotransmitters. The alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH)
   had an inhibitory effect on hormonal-induced luminescence. Because
   luzindole and 4P-PDOT inhibited MT-induced luminescence, the action of
   this hormone is likely to be mediated through binding to the MT2 receptor
   subtype, which probably decreases the intracellular concentration of
   cyclic AMP (cAMP) because forskolin (a cAMP donor) strongly inhibits the
   light response to MT. However, PRL seems to achieve its effects via janus
   kinase 2 (JAK2) after binding to its receptor because a specific JAK2
   inhibitor inhibits PRL-induced luminescence. The two stimulating hormones
   showed different kinetics as well as a seasonal variation of light
   intensity, which was higher in summer (April) than in winter (December
   and February). All of these results strongly suggest that, contrary to
   self-luminescent bony fishes, which harbour a nervous control mechanism
   of their photophore luminescence, the light emission is under hormonal
   control in the cartilaginous E. spinax. This clearly highlights the
   diversity of fish luminescence and confirms its multiple independent
   apparitions during the course of evolution.

AB Pax6 is a developmental control gene essential for eye development
   throughout the animal kingdom. In addition, Pax6 plays key roles in other
   parts of the CNS, olfactory system, and pancreas. In mammals a single
   Pax6 gene encoding multiple isoforms delivers these pleiotropic
   functions. Here we provide evidence that the genomes of many other
   vertebrate species contain multiple Pax6 loci. We sequenced
   Pax6-containing BACs from the cartilaginous elephant shark (Callorhinchus
   milii) and found two distinct Pax6 loci. Pax6.1 is highly similar to
   mammalian Pax6, while Pax6.2 encodes a paired-less Pax6. Using synteny
   relationships, we identify homologs of this novel paired-less Pax6.2 gene
   in lizard and in frog, as well as in zebrafish and in other teleosts. In
   zebrafish two full-length Pax6 duplicates were known previously,
   originating from the fish-specific genome duplication (FSGD) and
   expressed in divergent patterns due to paralog-specific loss of
   cis-elements. We show that teleosts other than zebrafish also maintain
   duplicate full-length Pax6 loci, but differences in gene and regulatory
   domain structure suggest that these Pax6 paralogs originate from a more
   ancient duplication event and are hence renamed as Pax6.3. Sequence
   comparisons between mammalian and elephant shark Pax6.1 loci highlight
   the presence of short- and long-range conserved noncoding elements
   (CNEs). Functional analysis demonstrates the ancient role of long-range
   enhancers for Pax6 transcription. We show that the paired-less Pax6.2
   ortholog in zebrafish is expressed specifically in the developing retina.
   Transgenic analysis of elephant shark and zebrafish Pax6.2 CNEs with
   homology to the mouse NRE/Pα internal promoter revealed highly specific
   retinal expression. Finally, morpholino depletion of zebrafish Pax6.2
   resulted in a “small eye” phenotype, supporting a role in retinal
   development. In summary, our study reveals that the pleiotropic functions
   of Pax6 in vertebrates are served by a divergent family of Pax6 genes,
   forged by ancient duplication events and by independent, lineage-specific
   gene losses.

AB The role of archaea in microbial mats is poorly understood. Delineating
   the spatial distribution of archaea with mat depth will enable resolution
   of putative niches in these systems. In the present study, high
   throughput amplicon sequencing was undertaken in conjunction with
   analysis of key biogeochemical properties of two mats (smooth and
   pustular) from Shark Bay, Australia. One-way analysis of similarity tests
   indicated the archaeal community structures of smooth and pustular mats
   were significantly different (global R = 1, p = 0.1%). Smooth mats
   possessed higher archaeal diversity, dominated by Parvarchaeota. The
   methanogenic community in smooth mats was dominated by hydrogenotrophic
   Methanomicrobiales, as well as methylotrophic Methanosarcinales,
   Methanococcales, Methanobacteriales and Methanomassiliicoccaceae.
   Pustular mats were enriched with Halobacteria and Parvarchaeota. Key
   metabolisms (bacterial and archaeal) were measured, and the rates of
   oxygen production/consumption and sulfate reduction were up to four times
   higher in smooth than in pustular mats. Methane production peaked in the
   oxic layers and was up to seven-fold higher in smooth than pustular mats.
   The finding of an abundance of anaerobic methanogens enriched at the
   surface where oxygen levels were highest, coupled with peak methane
   production in the oxic zone, suggests putative surface anoxic niches in
   these microbial mats.

AB Abstract Type II pepsin soluble collagens (PSC) were isolated from
   skeletal and head bone of silvertip shark; and examined for their
   biochemical and structural properties. Among the raw materials, the
   protein content (8.99%) was high in skeletal bone and the ash content
   (28%) was high in head bone. After the collagen extraction, the raw
   materials contained higher amount of ash content ranging from 82 to 88%.
   The hydroxyproline content of skeletal and skeletal PSC (30 and 113 mg/g)
   was higher than those head and head PSC. Both collagens were composed of
   two different α-chains (α 1 - and α 2 -chains) and were characterized as
   type II collagen. Amino acid analysis of skeletal and head PSC indicated
   imino acid contents of 156 and 175 amino acid residues per 1000 residues,
   respectively. Similar, Fourier transform infrared spectra of SCII and
   HCII were observed, which suggested that the isolation process did not
   affect the secondary structure and molecular order of collagen,
   particularly the triple–helical structure. Denaturation temperature of
   skeletal PSC (31 °C) was higher than that of head PSC. SEM microstructure
   of the collagens depicted a porous, fibrillary and multi-layered
   structure. These results suggested that the PSC isolated from skeletal
   and head bone of silvertip shark were found to be suitable biomaterial in
   commercial applications as alternatives to mammalian collagen.

AB Many midwater animals emit ventral light to hide their silhouette in the
   water column. This phenomenon known as counterillumination typically
   requires fine control over light emission since it needs a luminescence
   that closely matches the properties of downwelling light (intensity,
   angular distribution and wavelength). Here we provide evidence that,
   although lacking complex structures of counterilluminating animals, the
   deepwater luminescent shark Etmopterus spinax could, in Norwegian fjords,
   efficiently cloak its silhouette from downwelling ambient light to remain
   hidden from predator and prey. This represents the first experimentally
   tested function of luminescence in a shark and illustrates how evolution
   can take different routes to converge on identical complex behavior. (C)

AB Suitable long term species-specific catch rate and biological data are
   seldom available for large shark species, particularly where historical
   commercial logbook reporting has been poor. However, shark control
   programs can provide suitable data from gear that consistently fishes
   nearshore waters all year round. We present an analysis of the
   distribution of 4757 . Galeocerdo cuvier caught in surface nets and on
   drumlines across 9 of the 10 locations of the Queensland Shark Control
   Program (QSCP) between 1993 and 2010. Standardised catch rates showed a
   significant decline (p<. 0.0001) in southern Queensland locations for
   both gear types, which contrasts with studies at other locations where
   increases in tiger shark catch per unit effort (CPUE) have been reported.
   Significant temporal declines in the average size of tiger sharks
   occurred at four of the nine locations analysed (p<. 0.05), which may be
   indicative of fishing reducing abundance in these areas. Given the long
   term nature of shark control programs along the Australian east coast,
   effects on local abundance should have been evident many years ago, which
   suggests that factors other than the effects of shark control programs
   have also contributed to the decline. While reductions in catch rate are
   consistent with a decline in tiger shark abundance, this interpretation
   should be made with caution, as the inter-annual CPUE varies considerably
   at most locations. Nevertheless, the overall downward trend, particularly
   in southern Queensland, indicates that current fishing pressures on the
   species may be unsustainable. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB There have been significant efforts recently aimed at improving the
   aerodynamic performance of aerofoils through the modification of their
   surfaces. Inspired by the drag-reducing properties of the tooth-like
   denticles that cover the skin of sharks, we describe here experimental
   and simulation-based investigations into the aerodynamic effects of novel
   denticle-inspired designs placed along the suction side of an aerofoil.
   Through parametric modelling to query a wide range of different designs,
   we discovered a set of denticle-inspired surface structures that achieve
   simultaneous drag reduction and lift generation on an aerofoil, resulting
   in lift-to-drag ratio improvements comparable to the best-reported for
   traditional low-profile vortex generators and even outperforming these
   existing designs at low angles of attack with improvements of up to 323%.
   Such behaviour is enabled by two concurrent mechanisms: (i) a separation
   bubble in the denticle9s wake altering the flow pressure distribution of
   the aerofoil to enhance suction and (ii) streamwise vortices that
   replenish momentum loss in the boundary layer due to skin friction. Our
   findings not only open new avenues for improved aerodynamic design, but
   also provide new perspective on the role of the complex and potentially
   multifunctional morphology of shark denticles for increased swimming
   efficiency.

AB The whale shark (Rhincodon typus) has by far the largest body size of any

   extant species of the paraphyletic assemblage commonly referred to as
   fishes. As both a phenotypic extreme and a member of the group
   Chondrichthyes – the sister group to the remaining gnathostomes, which
   includes all tetrapods and therefore also humans – its genome is of
   substantial comparative interest. Whale sharks are also listed as an
   endangered species on the International Union for Conservation of
   Nature’s Red List of threatened species and are of growing popularity as
   both a target of ecotourism and as a charismatic conservation ambassador
   for the pelagic ecosystem. A genome map for this species would aid in
   defining effective conservation units and understanding global population
   structure. We characterised the nuclear genome of the whale shark using
   next generation sequencing (454, Illumina) and de novo assembly and
   annotation methods, based on material collected from the Georgia
   Aquarium. The data set consisted of 878,654,233 reads, which yielded a
   draft assembly of 1,213,200 contigs and 997,976 scaffolds. The estimated
   genome size was 3.44Gb. As expected, the proteome of the whale shark was
   most closely related to the only other complete genome of a cartilaginous
   fish, the holocephalan elephant shark. The whale shark contained a novel
   Toll-like-receptor (TLR) protein with sequence similarity to both the
   TLR4 and TLR13 proteins of mammals and TLR21 of teleosts. The data are
   publicly available on GenBank, FigShare, and from the NCBI Short Read
   Archive under accession number SRP044374. This represents the first
   shotgun elasmobranch genome and will aid studies of molecular
   systematics, biogeography, genetic differentiation, and conservation
   genetics in this and other shark species, as well as providing

AB Shark attacks on humans have prompted the implementation of shark control
   programs aiming at reducing local populations of potentially aggressive
   species using mostly gillnets. However, shark meshing produces ecological
   disturbances by inflicting severe mortality not only to sharks but also
   to several harmless, frequently endangered taxa, including cetaceans,
   sirenians and chelonids. A different methodological approach to mitigate
   shark peril off Recife combines bottom longlining and drumlines with
   comparably better results. This region has been experiencing an
   abnormally high shark attack rate since 1992, but the protective fishing
   strategy was developed in 2004 only. Unlike traditional shark control
   programs, the Shark Monitoring Program of Recife (SMPR) aims at removing
   dangerous sharks not from their populations but from the hazardous area
   instead, which is achieved by capturing, transporting and releasing
   sharks offshore. During 8 years, the SMPR caught fish and turtles only
   and showed high selectivity for sharks compared with shark meshing.
   Target species comprised carcharhinids and sphyrnids and accounted for 7%
   of total catch. The fishing mortality of abundant taxa was generally low
   except for Carcharhinus acronotus and Gymnothorax spp., and protected
   species had ∼100% survival. The shark attack rate diminished about 97%
   while fishing operations were being conducted (W = 1108.5, P < 0.001),
   whereas no-fishing periods and the period prior to the implementation of
   the SMPR had similar shark attack rates. Overall, the SMPR seems to be
   less detrimental than shark meshing strategies while clearly contributing
   for enhancing bather safety; thus, it may provide an effective,
   ecologically balanced tool for assisting in shark attack mitigation.
