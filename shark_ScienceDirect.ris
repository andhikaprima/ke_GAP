AB  - Large-scale and small-scale natural barriers have the ability to mediate the ecological dynamics within a region. In some instances, these barriers greatly influence the presence of predators and prey on spatio-temporal scales. For this study, we aimed to assess how varying densities of sea bamboo (Ecklonia maxima), a kelp species found within South African waters, could influence the presence of C. carcharias. Using baited remote underwater video systems (BRUVS), thirty-one different C. carcharias were identified and a total of 135 h of video were collected in high, moderate, and low kelp densities to create an organismal sighting index. Generalized linear models illustrated that the best fit model included the main effect of kelp density, with a clear inverse relationship between kelp density and C. carcharias sightings. However, although zero sharks were sighted within the high kelp density regions, ten different C. carcharias were sighted within the moderate kelp density regions, illustrating that the broad notion that C. carcharias do not navigate through kelp ecosystems is false and requires more specificity (e.g. high density kelp areas may result in decrease C. carcharias presence). In contrast, kelp density had no significant influence on the presence of five other elasmobranch species detected by the BRUVS. This study demonstrated that highly dense kelp forests (i.e. ≥1 stalk of kelp per 1 m2) serve as a local natural barrier for large C. carcharias; however, the need for a more inclusive analysis (e.g. routine inclusion of current speed and multi-location assessment) is warranted.

AB  - This review represents a comprehensive analysis on pollutants in elasmobranchs including meta-analysis on the most studied pollutants: mercury, cadmium, PCBs and DDTs, in muscle and liver tissue. Elasmobranchs are particularly vulnerable to pollutant exposure which may pose a risk to the organism as well as humans that consume elasmobranch products. The highest concentrations of pollutants were found in sharks occupying top trophic levels (Carcharhiniformes and Lamniformes). A human health risk assessment identified that children and adults consuming shark once a week are exposed to over three times more mercury than is recommended by the US EPA. This poses a risk to local fishing communities and international consumers of shark-based products, as well as those subject to the widespread mislabelling of elasmobranch products. Wider screening studies are recommended to determine the risk to elasmobranchs from emerging pollutants and more robust studies are recommended to assess the risks to human health.

AB  - The latest stock assessment for the dusky shark, Carcharhinus obscurus, in the western North Atlantic Ocean indicates the population is overfished and experiencing overfishing. As part of a rebuilding plan, the commercial and recreational retention of dusky sharks has been prohibited since 2000. Despite this prohibition, dusky sharks are bycatch in multiple fisheries, including the pelagic longline fishery; however, post-release mortality (PRM) rates have not been empirically determined for this gear. Herein we estimated PRM of dusky sharks captured by the US pelagic longline fleet in the western North Atlantic Ocean utilizing pop-up satellite archival transmitting (PSAT) tags. One hundred and twenty three dusky sharks were captured on commercial pelagic longline gear and time on the hook, based on hook timer data, ranged from 0.8 to 8.1 h (4.3 ± 0.28 h). No at-vessel mortality (AVM) was observed for any dusky sharks in this study. Prior to release, 50 PSAT LIFE tags (Lotek Inc.) were attached to dusky sharks (females n = 12, 209 ± 8 cm FL; males n = 4, 198 ± 7 cm FL; unknown sex n = 34, 214 ± 7 cm FL) to assess PRM rates in the pelagic longline fishery during a 30 day attachment period. Forty-three of the 50 deployed tags reported data with deployment times ranging from 1 to 28 days (11.2 ± 9.8 days). Four dusky sharks were in poor condition at release and two individuals suffered PRM, which occurred within two hours after release. Total mortality rate (AVM + PRM) in the current study was 5.1%, far below estimates reported for bottom longline gear (˜97%), and reinforces the notion that PRM should be evaluated by species, season, and gear type.

AB  - Social learning can be a shortcut for acquiring locally adaptive information. Animals that live in social groups have better access to social information, but gregarious and nonsocial species are also frequently exposed to social cues. Thus, social learning might simply reflect an animal's general ability to learn rather than an adaptation to social living. Here, we investigated social learning and the effect of frequency of social exposure in nonsocial, juvenile Port Jackson sharks, Heterodontus portusjacksoni. We compared (1) Individual Learners, (2) Sham-Observers, paired with a naïve shark, and (3) Observers, paired with a trained demonstrator, in a novel foraging task. We found that more Observers learnt the foraging route compared to Individual Learners or Sham-Observers, and that Individual Learners took more days to learn. Training frequency did not affect learning rate, suggesting acquisition occurred mostly between training bouts. When demonstrators were absent, 30% of observers maintained their performance above the learning criterion, indicating they retained the acquired information. These results indicate that social living is not a prerequisite for social learning in elasmobranchs and suggest social learning is ubiquitous in vertebrates.

AB  - Significant variation in deepwater shark assemblages between those found in the 500 m depth band, and those of deeper waters is identified in the analysis of data from the northeast Atlantic continental slope and the northern slope of the Porcupine Bank. Deepwater shark data from four research surveys carried out between 2006 and 2009 yielded twenty-one deepwater shark species from five depth strata across three areas. It is suggested that a new grouping of sharks, “slope”, be considered to reflect those species that are not easily categorised as either Shelf or Deepwater. This may have implications for assessment and management. Depth was identified as having a major influence on the variability of shark catch per unit effort (CPUE), whilst less variability was detected across the area or between years, indicating that depth based management rather than local or regional management measures may be more appropriate.

We demonstrate that the figures used in support of this claim are inappropriately selected, misinterpreted or incorrect, and that therefore the argument cannot stand. In the face of the extreme depletion of shark numbers globally, the paper fails to give an accurate or objective assessment of the situation.

AB  - Marine spatial planning (MSP), a process aimed at negotiating the spatial allocation of human activities at sea, has to integrate new challenges arising from growing human activities and their impacts on threatened marine ecosystems. Yet, human–wildlife interactions that result in threat to humans are rarely explicitly addressed in planning and almost not at all in MSP. Rare events of unprovoked shark bites can significantly impact local economies while leading to polarized social debates that often hinder the development of evidence-based shark risk public policy. Here, we suggest an approach for integrating shark risk and its management into MSP. The method addresses simultaneously the spatial, social, and ecological components of shark risk and its inherent uncertainties. The approach is applied on Reunion Island case study where shark risk management is implemented as a response to a rapid increase in the frequency of shark bite events over the past decade. Similar to other countries where shark risk management is implemented, sharks’ removal is in the heart of social debate in Reunion Islands (3860 shark fishing operations in 5 years) and data gaps provide a fertile ground for alternative discourses and social conflicts about shark risk. Through a structured public consultation involving 200 stakeholders we demonstrate how MSP can be used to address shark risk while considering multiple sea-uses and conservation objectives. The results suggest that the approach is ideal, both for integrating shark risk as a driver to the MSP process, and for developing a transparent, sustainable and evidence-based shark risk public policy as it places shark risk management within a broader social-ecological spectrum of stakes.

KW  - Mexican shark landings trends
KW  - Shark conservation
KW  - Mexican shark regulations
AB  - Sharks have been of great cultural and socioeconomic importance in Mexico since the late 19th century, when the first fisheries were prosecuted in the Gulf of California to export fins to China. Mexican shark and ray fisheries are classified mainly by the size of the fishing vessel and include small- (7.5–10m), medium- (10–27m), and large-sized (>27m) fisheries. All are multispecies fisheries that use longline or gillnet gear, with their relative productivity varying over time. Off the Pacific coast, early shark small size vessel fisheries in the Gulf of California were driven by the need for vitamin A from livers, especially during World War II. As this fishery declined, new shark fishing opportunities arose because of government support and the development of the medium-sized fishery, which was capable of farther offshore excursions. Shark meat became an important part of the diets of poor and impoverished citizens during the 1950s and 1960s. The establishment of a Mexican Exclusive Economic Zone in 1976 pushed foreign vessels from Asia out of Mexican waters and led to the development of the large-sized vessel fishery to exploit pelagic sharks in offshore waters. By the early 1980s, Mexico shark fisheries were among the most productive in the world; however, a national economic crisis reduced effort and landings until the late 1980s, when several new fisheries emerged. Landings from Pacific states fluctuated between ~13,000 and 24,000t (dressed weight) during 1987–2012 but expanded steadily thereafter because of government support and offshore fleet expansion. Shark fisheries landings from the Mexican Pacific are currently at their highest recorded levels, exceeding 31,000t; however, a lack of species-specific landings and life history information has precluded population assessments of targeted stocks. In addition, though several recent management measures have been enacted to protect Mexican shark and ray fishery resources, the enforcement of these regulations is severely lacking. Therefore, the long-term sustainability of current fishing levels is unknown but should engender concern based on anecdotal evidence of serial depletion among historical elasmobranch targets in the Mexican Pacific.

AB  - This paper examines the unprecedented decimation of sharks. In accordance with the biological characteristics and the economic environment of sharks, we extend the Brander-Taylor model of renewable resources and trade to a resource with a continuum of species which are heterogeneous with respect to their growth rate. The model implies that heterogeneity increases the vulnerability of a resource as relatively abundant species make harvesting economically viable even though slow-growing species are driven to extinction. The empirical analysis assesses the fate of sharks in the light of the model and finds that the likelihood of extinction is, indeed, significantly greater for shark species which exhibit low intrinsic growth.

AB  - Unprovoked shark bites are one of the most recognised human-wildlife conflicts in the marine environment. Historically, management of this threat to public safety largely involved the implementation of lethal strategies. However, there is increasing environmental necessity and social pressure to adopt alternative strategies that minimise harm to sharks and other marine life. While different approaches have been developed that aim to reduce the risk of shark interactions with people, it is difficult to quantify their efficacy due to the rarity of shark bites and a lack of understanding of localised distributions of white (Carcharodon carcharias), bull (Carcharhinus leucas), and tiger (Galeocerdo cuvier) sharks, particularly close to surf breaks. Here, we used a rare opportunity to compare observations of these three ‘target’ shark species nearshore from drone-based surveillance to those caught on SMART (Shark-Management-Alert-in-Real-Time) drumlines and detected from VR4G acoustic receivers, with the latter two both located approximately 500 m offshore. Across 243 operational days, where all three methods were in use off three separate beaches on the east coast of Australia, we found no evidence for nearshore drone-based observations of target shark species to correlate with catches from SMART drumlines or detections from the VR4G acoustic receivers. The absence of correlation was still evident when 2-day, and 3-day moving averages of catches from SMART drumlines and detections from acoustic receivers were considered. While drone-based surveillance can incur sightability errors, it was evident that SMART drumlines do not prevent sharks from entering near the surf zone, and this does not coincide with the portion of sharks detected by the VR4G acoustic receivers. We contend that there is a need for a greater understanding of behavioural processes of large predatory sharks that may pose a threat to ocean users, particularly when considering non-destructive approaches to shark mitigation.

AB  - In this study we investigated the metabolic consequences of simulated gillnet capture in species with contrasting life-history characteristics, the gummy shark, Mustelus antarcticus and the Port Jackson shark, Heterdontus portusjacksoni. Pre-stress standard and routine metabolic rates (MR) of individuals of these species were measured and compared to the MR obtained after simulated gillnet capture. Standard MRs of M. antarcticus and H. portusjacksoni were 168.5 ± 61.9 mgO2 kg-0.67 h−1 and 144.1 ± 20.4 mgO2 kg-0.67 h−1, respectively. Routine MRs of M. antarcticus and H. portusjacksoni were 202.6 ± 63.5 mgO2 kg-0.67 h−1 and 166.4 ± 11.2 mgO2 kg-0.67 h−1, respectively. The simulated gillnet-capture treatment decreased the MR of M. antarcticus by 59.3% and increased that of H. portusjacksoni by 21.6%. Our results confirm that M. antarcticus is highly sensitive to gillnet capture, exhibiting significant variability in MR among individuals and also a high delayed mortality rate. We interpret the decrease in MR as a compensatory mechanism for reducing oxygen consumption to cope with the stress imposed by capture. Mortality in this species was associated with higher pre-stress MR, and lower post-stress MR. In contrast, H. portusjacksoni showed mild increases in MR. Their resilience to capture stress most likely relies on effective buccal pumping and lower basal MR. A mixed-effects model approach permitted us to identify the main sources of variation in the MR measured, which were the individual differences, treatment effects, species variations and delayed mortality. The comparative approach employed in this work allowed us to understand and provide reliable estimates of the effects of fishing on the MRs of these two species.

AB  - We used long-term observations of 55 individually identified tiger sharks (Galeocerdo cuvier) at a shark ecotourism site off Tahiti to estimate the prevalence, retention times and impacts of residual hooks and trailing line resulting from fisheries interactions. Thirty-eight percent of tiger sharks had at least one fisheries interaction resulting in retained hooks during the 8-year observation period. Both stainless-steel and corrodible hooks had a retention half-life of less than 1 year, and all corrodible hooks were shed within 2.5 years whereas firmly embedded stainless-steel hooks persisted for at least 7.6 years and are potentially retained for the lifetime of the shark. The presence of residual hooks and trailing line did not impact tiger shark growth suggesting that sharks were able to feed normally despite trailing gear. However, only a single internally-hooked sharks trailing line was observed suggesting their survival may perhaps be lower than externally-hooked individuals. Hook-retention data obtained from this study could be extrapolated to other warm water shark species that are difficult to observe in their natural habitats (e.g. oceanic whitetip shark, Carcharhinus longimanus).

AB  - Whitespotted bamboo shark (Chiloscyllium plagiosum) is a demersal cartilaginous fish with an adaptive immune system founded upon immunoglobulins. In this manuscript, we characterize the IgNAR of the whitespotted bamboo shark. A newly discovered alternative splicing form of IgNAR Sec (IgNARshort (ΔC2-C3) Sec) was identified, in which the C1 domain was spliced directly to the C4 domain, the process resulted in a molecule containing three constant domains. However, a single unpaired cysteine remains in the highly flexible hinge region, contributing in the formation of an interchain disulfide bond. Two types of C1 domain were found, and the one lacking a short α-helix showed lower proportion. This finding suggests that short α-helices might be important to the stability of IgNAR. High-throughput sequencing revealed that the percentage of VNAR types significantly vary between the diverse species of sharks. The variable region of IgNAR (the VNAR) with small size and stabilization is a potential candidate for immunotherapeutic agents. The structure and stability analysis in this manuscript may be useful in future biomedical applications.

AB  - Thresher sharks (family Alopiidae) are highly migratory pelagic predators whose populations have drastically declined due to extensive fishing for their fins. There are only three species of thresher sharks worldwide. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed pelagic (A. pelagicus) thresher sharks as endangered while bigeye (Alopias superciliosus) and common (A. vulpinus) thresher sharks as vulnerable to extinction. There is limited scientific information about thresher shark fisheries in the Philipines. In this study we described a thresher shark fishery in Tawi-Tawi, Southern Philippines which has been existing for more than 20 years now. The fishery is generally small-scale, using simple hook and line and 13-hp inboard motorized boats with a capacity of one to two fishers per boat. Fishing is year-round with peak season occurring from March to May. Fishers spend about 10 days per month fishing during neap tide when the currents are weak. All three species of thresher sharks are caught in Tawi-Tawi. They are generally hunted for their fins and meat which are sold to local buyers. About 50 boats fish per day with about half of them catching one to two sharks. Our study suggests that monthly production of thresher sharks during the peak season in 2018 was about 15.3 mt or valued at about US$19,886.39. Our study is the first to report that the Sibutu Passage is an important fishing grounds for thresher sharks which must be put under immediate protection for effective conservation of these valuable species.

AB  - Sharks and their cartilaginous relatives (Class Chondrichthyes, herein ‘sharks’) are one of the world's most threatened species groups. Their slow life history traits and vulnerability to capture make them particularly susceptible to overfishing, and they are widely caught in both target and by-catch fisheries. Fisheries management measures that can effectively reduce shark fishing mortality are urgently required to halt population declines and species extinctions. We provide an overview of typical measures for understanding and managing risks to sharks, and highlight critical gaps relating to incorporating socio-economic factors in to research and management. We argue that neglecting these factors hinders effective shark conservation, and has negative consequences for people. We emphasise the importance of a holistic approach, which explicitly considers socio-economic factors in decision-making. Based on this, we propose the first framework for assessing feasibility in a shark management context, which could be integrated with traditional fisheries risk assessments in order to bridge this gap. This framework considers key dimensions of the costs, benefits and overall enabling environment for shark management in a given fishery. Overall, managers and policy makers must consider socio-economic factors in shark conservation efforts to deliver better outcomes for sharks and people. Our simple feasibility framework can support this by enabling costs, benefits and context to be explicitly considered in planning and policy-making, alongside the typical biological and technical risks to sharks in fisheries.

AB  - The relative abundance and biological characteristics of the spadenose shark Scoliodon laticaudus, from the south eastern Arabian Sea along Karnataka, India was studied. The average annual catch of the species during the period 2012–2017 was estimated at 112 t which formed about 13% of the total shark landing in the region. The species is landed mostly by trawl nets. Monthly abundance estimates showed that highest landing of the spadenose shark was observed in January. A total of 852 specimens were studied for biological characteristics. The length range of 19–63 cm was observed and length group of 45–55 cm formed the mainstay of the fishery. The length weight relationship for male and female and sexes pooled were 0.06588 L2.2386; 0.01118 L2.7497 and 0.01396 L2.6840 respectively. Analysis of covariance showed significant differences between the male and female (p<0.05). In the present analysis, the regression co-efficient (b value) for the species differs significantly from the value 3 indicating allometric growth. Lm50 for female and male were estimated as 32 and 33 cm. Chi-square-test on monthly sex ratio for the period showed that there was significant difference in sex ratio only in the months of January, October and November. S. laticaudus was found to be predominantly piscivorous in diet. The fishery is declining and efforts have to be taken for sustainable exploitation of resources.

AB  - Conventional monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have been widely used in research and diagnostic applications due to their high affinity and specificity. However, multiple limitations, such as large size, complex structure and sensitivity to extreme ambient temperature potentially weaken the performance of mAbs in certain applications. To address this problem, the exploration of new antigen binders is extensively required in relation to improve the quality of current diagnostic platforms. In recent years, a new immunoglobulin-based protein, namely variable domain of new antigen receptor (VNAR) was discovered in sharks. Unlike conventional mAbs, several advantages of VNARs, include small size, better thermostability and peculiar paratope structure have attracted interest of researchers to further explore on it. This article aims to first present an overview of the shark VNARs and outline the characteristics as an outstanding new reagent for diagnostic and therapeutic applications.

AB  - Shark-X is a set of Perl-based tools build around the deterministic neutron transport code CASMO-5, used to perform uncertainty quantification for lattice calculations at the Paul Scherrer Institut (PSI). While perturbing an input parameter, e.g. a cross section in a given energy range, the resulting perturbation to the effective cross section, e.g. multigroup cross section, can be expressed as the sum of an explicit and implicit component. The implicit term stems from changes in the neutron flux resulting from the cross section perturbation. This effect is neglected when using the standard perturbation theory methodology, even though its importance for uncertainty quantification is reported in the literature. The objectives of the paper are, in view of further enhancing Shark-X, to review a set of existing methods and to propose novel methodologies in order to accurately take the implicit effect into account in the resonance shielding treatment of CASMO-5; as well as to assess the importance of the new tool for typical LWR applications. Amongst the methods considered, those based on an equivalence in dilution allow perturbing the group-averaged cross sections without having to solve the slowing down problem in conjunction with the perturbed point-wise cross sections. However, such methods are found to show only limited improvements as compared to the standard perturbed self-shielded cross sections determined neglecting the implicit effect. As a result, a simpler approach based on the pre-determination of perturbation factors is adopted and implemented into Shark-X and CASMO-5. The new implementation is successfully tested and verified by comparing k-inf sensitivity coefficients computed with Shark-X with those from a Monte-Carlo reference solution, and this for a range of simple homogeneous mixtures as well as for LWR pin cells and lattices. Finally, the paper demonstrates through simple considerations, that the magnitude of the implicit effect is related to the energy group structure in the resolved resonance region, which might be specific to the code used to compute the sensitivity coefficients. The finer is the energy mesh; the smaller is also the impact of the implicit effect, and as such the necessity for a specific treatment.

AB  - The diet and feeding habits of the whitespotted bamboo shark (Chiloscyllium plagiosum) were described using stomach content analysis and stable isotope analysis based on 327 and 78 specimens, respectively, that were collected in northern Taiwanese waters from October 2013 to March 2015. The index of relative importance indicated that both females and males mainly fed on Demospongiae, unidentified organisms, Annelida, and crustaceans. Juveniles (< 65 cm in total length, TL) preferred Annelida and crustaceans, while adults (> 65 cm in TL) fed more on teleost fishes. Similar standardized diet breadths (Ba) were found for sharks caught by different fishing gear and for sharks at different maturity stages; however, seasonal variation in Ba was noted. These results suggest that the whitespotted bamboo shark is a prey specialist. No significant differences in prey composition among fishing gear, sexes, maturity stages, or seasons were found by the multi-variate statistical analysis. Permutational multi-variate analysis of variance and a global test also indicated that there were no significant differences in diets between the maturity stages and sexes. The stable isotope analysis indicated that the mean values of δ15N and δ13C for the females and males were similar, suggesting the existence of high overlap in terms of feeding for both sexes. A multi-variate analysis of variance indicated that significant differences were found for the mean values of δ13C and δ15N among the different seasons, maturity stages and season–maturity stage interactions. These results suggested that an ontogenetic shift in the diet of C. plagiosum may occur when the fish approach the size of maturity.

AB  - The contamination of tiger sharks (Galeocerdo cuvier) and bull sharks (Carcharhinus leucas) by legacy persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and emerging organic contaminants was investigated in specimens from Reunion Island (Southwest Indian Ocean) in 2018 and 2019. Contamination levels were determined in the muscle of adult individuals of both sexes in relation to biological and trophic parameters. Maternal transfer was additionally investigated in one set of embryos in each species. Polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB), organochlorinated pesticide (OCP) and perfluoroalkylated substance (PFAS) concentrations were 2597 ± 2969, 785 ± 966 and 267 ± 194 pg g-1 ww, respectively, in bull sharks, and 339 ± 270, 1025 ± 946 and 144 ± 53 pg g-1 ww in tiger sharks. The results highlighted higher PCB contamination, and by the heavier congeners, in adult bull sharks versus tiger sharks. The significant differences found in PCB profiles and concentrations suggest that the two species are exposed to different contamination sources. As bull sharks rely on a more coastal habitat for feeding, their higher contamination by PCBs suggests the occurrence of local PCB sources. DDT concentrations were similar in both species, suggesting a more homogeneous contamination on the scale of the Southwest Indian Ocean. Female bull sharks showed lower OCP and PCB concentrations than males, while this trend was not observed in tiger sharks. The ratio of chlorinated contaminants in muscle between the mother and her embryos was related to molecule hydrophobicity in bull shark but not in tiger shark, suggesting that shark mode of gestation, known to be different in the two species, is a key driver of organic contaminant maternal transfer. Finally, the results show that organic contaminant levels in the studied species were lower than those of other shark species in the Southern Hemisphere, related to the limited urbanization and industrialization of Reunion Island.

AB  - Shark's buoyancy depends on two types of force: (i) the hydrostatic force which is mainly provided by their liver filled with low density lipids and (ii) the hydrodynamic force which is provided by the morphology of their body and fins. Shallow-water shark species are usually negatively buoyant, whereas deep-sea shark species have been suggested to display neutral buoyancy. It has been suggested that species that are close to the neutrality would have less red aerobic muscle fibers. Here, we investigated several liver features (the hepatosomatic index, the oil content and the lipid composition) playing a major role regarding the buoyancy of three deep-sea shark species (Etmopterus molleri, Etmopterus spinax and Isistius brasiliensis) and one shallow-water counterpart (Galeus melastomus). We used FT-Raman and FT-MIR spectroscopy to qualify/quantify the lipid composition of their liver. Our results showed that most deep-sea shark species studied have liver features providing more buoyancy than their shallow-water counterparts, appart from E. molleri which shows liver's features that resemble more shallow-water shark species (e.g. G. melastomus). Finally, data regarding liver features of several deep-sea shark species from the literature were added and the red aerobic muscle distribution/proportion of nine species was measured, to reveal how these parameters might be related. Our results showed that sharks characterized by a liver providing more hydrostatic force possess proportionally less red aerobic muscles than sharks having a liver that contributes less to their buoyancy. Therefore, our results i.e. deep-sea shark displaying less red aerobic muscle with a liver providing more buoyancy, support low metabolic rates hence slow swimming speed.

AB  - The Gulf of Tadjoura (Djibouti) is an important site where the whale shark (Rhincodon typus Smith, 1828) aggregates seasonally. Because of the proximity to the port of Djibouti that is located along one of the busiest shipping areas in the world, whale sharks are potentially exposed to relatively high levels of trace elements and organochlorines. To assess their contamination status, concentrations of 15 trace elements, DDTs and PCBs were concurrently assessed for the first time in skin biopsies of 20 whale sharks. Additionally, 12 zooplankton samples were collected and analyzed for trace elements content. Concentration of As, Cu, Zn and Se were higher than in previous studies on this species. Whale shark samples exceeded the maximum allowable limits for foodstuffs for Cr, Pb Se, Cd and Zn. Results from this study suggests that Cr, Ni and Mo may biomagnify in this species. With regard to PCBs, the predominant congener were Tetra-CB, accounting for 41% of total PCBs and Penta-CB for 23%, while for DDTs, the predominant metabolite was DDE contributing for 51% of total compounds. The maximum residue limit for DDTs and for the ind-PCBs in fish set by U.S. EPA and by the EU regulation, respectively, was exceeded in 62% of whale sharks. Moreover, the p,p′DDE/ΣDDT ratios were higher than the critical value of 0.6, indicating possible recent inputs of technical DDTs in the area. This study suggests some concerns for the contamination status of whale sharks in Djibouti and, since major threats for this species include bycatch and illegal fisheries, highlights some level of risk from the exposure to elemental- and organic-contaminant via shark consumption.

AB  - Sharks are highly vulnerable species due to their biological characteristics. Productivity and Susceptibility Analysis (PSA) is a useful method to assess the vulnerability of shark populations to prioritize management strategies. Given that molecular and genetic tools have played an important role in the conservation of vulnerable populations and species, the objective of this study was to evaluate the ecological risk of Prionace glauca, Isurus oxyrinchus, and Alopias vulpinus in the Mexican Pacific by incorporating genetic information into PSA. We hypothesized that the integration of genetic variables such as genetic structure and diversity (Fst, h, and π), in a PSA will allow us to discriminate species with the same vulnerability index. The results of PSA-1 indicated that I. oxyrinchus, and A. vulpinus were at high ecological risk with identical vulnerability values (v = 2.2). Our results suggest that PSA with the combination of genetic attributes could be a useful tool for the application of conservation strategies or management policies, making easier the interpretation of results when the productivity or susceptibility attributes do not provide enough variation to prioritize between species or populations analyzed. Nevertheless, more studies that combine fishery and genetic information of commercially important sharks are needed.

AB  - Fisherman have known and explored the association between tuna and whale sharks for centuries. Just as in the past, present day industrial fishers search for the presence of whale shark as cue to locate tuna schools. These whale shark-tuna associations have been usually assumed to result from the same ecological drivers that govern the attraction of tunas and other fishes towards floating objects or Fish Aggregation Devices (FAD). Yet, this assumption has never been explicitly investigated. As a result, the ecological (evolutionary) significance of the whale shark-tuna associations and the potential impacts of fishing these associations remain unclear. Here, we set out to test a set of predictions expected under the framework of the ‘indicator-log’ and the ‘meeting-point’ hypotheses, originally proposed in the context of the tuna-FAD associative behaviour, by contrasting inter-annual fishing patterns, over 16-years, across highly variable whale shark abundance periods and comparing whale shark associated tuna schools and free swimming schools in the Azores. In addition we also analysed the tuna fishing fleet behaviour over periods of high and low whale shark abundance across the archipelago. We found an overall south and eastward migration of fishing effort towards lower latitudes, where most whale sharks were reported, compared to the low whale shark occurrence period. Overall we found that the whale shark associated school differed from free swimming schools and fishing yields were also influenced by the presence of the whale shark. Specifically, we found that skipjack, bigeye, albacore and yellowfin tuna are caught in higher quantities when associated with whale sharks. Whale shark associated schools were more diverse and yielded smaller fish on average than free-swimming schools, as predicted under the theoretical framework of tuna-FAD associations. Our results highlight the possibility that whale shark behaviour may play an active role in the association dynamics, and that these associations may be mutually beneficial. We argue that whale sharks may represent a “meeting point” for the aggregation of small tunas and that this behaviour is more likely to be size dependent than species oriented. Finally, we discuss the potential implications of our findings for the management and conservation of both tunas and whale sharks.

AB  - The basking shark (Cetorhinus maximus) is an endangered species in the north-east Atlantic, having been historically over exploited. Whilst near-shore aggregation hotspots in the UK have been identified, robust knowledge on species distribution and abundance outside these areas remains limited. Research techniques, such as habitat modelling, could however be used to gain a greater knowledge of the species distribution to inform management plans to aid population recovery. For large mobile species gathering wide-scale distribution data can be financially and logistically challenging. In lieu of conducting an expensive UK-wide strategic survey for basking sharks, we use data from two regional-scale surveys, which were conducted in southwest England and western Scotland, in an Ensemble Ecological Niche Model (EENM) to produce a spatially-explicit map of habitat suitability. When compared against a ~20-year database of public sightings of basking sharks across UK coastal seas (to 6 nautical miles offshore), patterns of habitat suitability yielded a statistically significant agreement with areas known to support basking shark sightings. EENMs could be used to advise Marine Protected Area (MPA) selection, as well as to inform environmental impact assessments for offshore developments. The application of EENM outputs could be wide-reaching and benefit not only basking sharks but other large mobile marine species in the north-east Atlantic.

AB  - The golden cownose ray (Rhinoptera steindachneri) and the whale shark (Rhincodon typus) are two elasmobranch species commonly found in Bahía de La Paz, Baja California Sur, Mexico. There are no records of the species sharing the same sites, as their prey, ecology and migration sites normally deviate. Both are listed as endangered and vulnerable species, respectively, under Mexican and international regulations. We took images by a quad-copter near Mogote Beach and recorded whale sharks during late July, alongside a group of golden cownose rays, although earlier research suggests that the main whale shark feeding season starts in late August or September. These recordings showed for the first time, the co-occurrence of these two vulnerable elasmobranch species while feeding possibly simultaneously. This indicates that there might be a relation between the presence of the two species and the interannual variability in zooplankton abundance. The latter may have implications for possible resource overlapping, a current topic in elasmobranch research. Furthermore, these findings highlight the usefulness of drones when capturing biological data. This information is important in the understanding of the ecology and trophic interactions of threatened species and is a step forward towards their understanding and conservation.

AB  - Sharks are simultaneously a subsistence food and a luxury item. Shark fins are consumed during special occasions among primarily the East Asian elite, whereas shark meat is consumed by many globally, including by fishers and their families. Policies guiding the management of shark fisheries vary globally, with inconsistent protections for sharks across their ranges and insufficient consideration of the multifaceted demands for shark products. Banning shark fishing is a popular management strategy; however, a full ban on shark fishing has the potential to threaten both food security and food sovereignty of small-scale fishing communities. In this paper, we investigate the tension between the subsistence and commercial value of sharks, examining the history and current status of shark fishing practices in Madagascar. From this case study, we analyze how current management strategies contribute to shark conservation and food sovereignty. Ultimately, we argue in favor of a rights-based approach to shark fisheries policy in Madagascar, and in other food insecure nations in the process of evaluating and expanding their shark conservation efforts, that considers (a) the end use of the sharks (e.g. implement policies favoring fishers who land sharks for subsistence), (b) the mode of access fishers use to harvest sharks (e.g. imposing greater restrictions on industrial vessels), and (c) direct and ongoing participation of local fishers in decision-making occurring at all scales of governance. While these suggestions pertain to shark fisheries globally, they are especially pertinent to fisheries-dependent countries with high rates of food insecurity in the Global South.

AB  - There is a vital necessity to provide more biological data on rays and sharks to promote efficient conservation. In this study, we assembled a database of weekly sightings to describe temporal (seasonal) patterns in the presence of elasmobranchs within an urban, semi-enclosed, landscape (Las Canteras beach, Gran Canaria Island, eastern Atlantic). Data also provided insight into their habitat use and population structure. From October 2015 to October 2018, eight species, either endangered or “data deficient” according to the IUCN red list, were reported, including: the common eagle ray, Myliobatis aquila, the common stingray, Dasyatis pastinaca, the round stingray, Taeniurops grabatus, the spiny butterfly ray, Gymnura altavela, the bull ray, Aetomylaeus bovinus, the angel shark, Squatina squatina, the marbled electric ray, Torpedo marmorata and the hammerhead shark, Sphyrna zygaena. All species were predominantly observed at night. The species varied in their habitat use; D. pastinaca, G. altavela and S. squatina dominated in sandy and mixed bottoms, while M. aquila and T. grabatus were mostly found in rocky and mixed bottoms. Both D. pastinaca and T. grabatus did not show any seasonal pattern, with consistent records all year around. In contrast, M. aquila, G. altavela and S. squatina showed some degree of seasonality. For five species, small-sized individuals were observed. If semi-enclosed embayments at oceanic islands, under intense human presence, are used by juveniles of endangered rays and sharks, proper management, e.g. limitation of putative human interactions, need to be considered to avoid disturbances.

AB  - On the west coast of Baja California Sur, the shark species Mustelus henlei, Carcharhinus falciformis, Prionace glauca, Isurus oxyrinchus, and Sphyrna zygaena are of economic importance and coexist in the same ecosystem. However, the trophic role of each species in this ecosystem is poorly understood. Stable isotopes of nitrogen and carbon (δ15N, δ13C) have been used as an indicator of trophic habitat at different time scales, showing the foraging area and trophic position of sharks. The isotopic values in the muscle and blood of five shark species were analyzed on the southwest coast of Baja California Sur. The isotopic values of P. glauca, S. zygaena and C. falciformis indicated a trophic habitat in oceanic areas, which is a characteristic of these species considering that they feed mainly on mesopelagic cephalopods; whereas M. henlei and I. oxyrinchus showed a benthic diet in oceanic waters. The highest trophic position based on muscle and blood results was in S. zygaena, while the lowest trophic position was in the tissue of C. falciformis, probably because this species feeds on a higher proportion of the crustacean Pleuroncodes planipes. Some of these species share prey and forage in the same area.

AB  - Shark tourism is a new concept that has not yet been recognized in Israel. While the principles and regulation of shark tourism in particular and wildlife tourism in general are developing rapidly worldwide, in Israel we are only at the very beginning of this process. The aggregations of sharks near the power plant in Hadera (in the middle-northern part of the Israeli coast) are a source of interest and attraction for many people, including swimmers, divers, and kayakers. The desire of tourists, and therefore of local businesses as well, to take part in this amazing and profitable phenomenon poses certain risks, in view of the lack of regulation in the area. In this study we analyse the ecological-socioeconomic consequences of shark tourism as well as the risks of visitor pressure for the environment. Our observations suggest that human divers might disturb the sharks and influence behavioral changes. We call on decision makers to regulate the area have least ecological damage so that the sharks can live with minimum disturbance while allowing some reasonable amount of wildlife tourism.

AB  - Sharks are an important component of coastal fisheries. Accordingly, the impacts of small-scale shark fisheries are likely significant, but data, including socio-economic drivers, are often scarce. Fiji features active but largely unregulated and unmonitored artisanal fisheries. Data suggest that the country's small-scale shark fisheries have the potential to become more targeted. This study considers the socio-economic value of shark fisheries across stakeholder groups. In 2017, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 211 fishers throughout Fiji, out of which 66.8% reported catching sharks of 11 species. Of those who caught sharks, 19.9% stated to release them dead or alive, while 78.7% retained the sharks. Various reasons were cited for shark retention with the most common explanation being to meet dietary needs. Only 19.8% of the participants who retained sharks sold them, yet fishers who gain additional income from the sale of sharks had significantly higher mean maximum catch rates compared to fishers who retained sharks for consumption. Fewer fishers reported selling shark fins compared to a previous comparable survey. This study indicates a decreasing relevance of small-scale coastal shark fisheries for income generation but an increasing utilisation of shark meat as a substitute for traditional food fishes.

AB  - In response to a spate of shark attacks in Reunion Island in the southwest Indian Ocean since 2011, local authorities developed an experimental shark-control program based on those conducted for decades in Australia and South Africa. In order to greatly reduce, if not eliminate, the impact of such a shark fishing program on bycatch and undersized target shark species, the use of conventional “drumlines” was improved by the addition of an innovative “Catch-A-Live”® system, making the drumlines ‘SMART’ (Shark Management Alert in Real Time). This is a real-time strike alert system based on an adapted triggering mechanism, which links the fishing line to a GPS buoy connected to the Iridium satellite. This system alerts fishers on duty via a computer-based communication system within just a few minutes, enabling immediate intervention. Off Reunion Island, up to 20 SMART drumlines (SDLs) were deployed along the west and southwest coast in coastal waters to target bull (Carcharhinus leucas) and tiger sharks (Galeocerdo cuvier) in trials conducted between 2014 and 2017. During 58,770 h of fishing there were 269 catches of more than 14 species, of which 86.9% were retrieved alive. There were marked differences in survival among species. While the most fragile species were the giant trevally (Caranx ignobilis), scalloped hammerhead sharks (Sphyrna lewini) and small carcharhinid species, most of the other bycatch species (stingrays Dasyatis sp., giant guitarfish Rhyncobathus djiddensis, and tawny nurse sharks Nebrius ferrugineus) were generally found alive and in a condition suitable for tag and release. Of the target species, 94.8% of all individuals were found alive. These survival rates are far higher than those of other programs using conventional drumlines in KwaZulu-Natal (South Africa) and Queensland (Australia). There were strong diurnal and lunar catch patterns. This information is invaluable in planning fishing operations to maximise the catch of the target species, while reducing the chances of killing the bycatch. These results highlight the potential for use of SDLs in research programs aimed at tagging large sharks capable of tripping the trigger, especially in situations where catch rates are so low that it is impractical for the fishing vessel to remain at sea for the duration of each fishing operation.

AB  - Pelagic sharks are an important bycatch in pelagic fisheries, especially for drifting longlines targeting swordfish. In the Cabo Verde Archipelago (tropical NE Atlantic), pelagic shark catches can reach a significant proportion of the total catches. Due to the increased concern on the status of pelagic shark species, this study was developed to enhance the current knowledge of those sharks in the Cabo Verde region in comparison to the adjacent areas, especially associated with European Union (EU) pelagic longline fishing activity. Stock status indicators for the two main species, blue shark (Prionace glauca) and shortfin mako (Isurus oxyrinchus), were developed, based on fisheries data from logbooks and onboard scientific observers, including analysis of size frequency distributions and standardized catch-per-unit-of-effort (CPUE) indexes over time. The standardized CPUEs have been stable or increasing for both species in the past 10 years, indicating no signs of local depletion. In terms of sizes, the blue shark catch is composed mainly of adults, which can be a sign of a stable population. On the contrary, the catch of shortfin mako is composed mainly of juveniles, which in conjunction of a decrease of mean size might be a cause of concern, highlighting possible overfishing on the species in the region. Thirty satellite tags, 25 archival miniPATs and 5 SPOT GPS, were deployed in the Cabo Verde Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), showing that those species are highly mobile. The biomass and size distributions were modeled with spatial and seasonal models (GAMs) identifying locations where juveniles are predominantly concentrated and that should be prioritized for conservation. This work presents new information on the status of pelagic sharks in the Cabo Verde region in the context of those highly migratory species, and can now be used to promote more sustainable fisheries in the region.

AB  - Background
The Greenland shark is renowned for its great longevity, yet little is known about its reproduction.
Methods
We supplemented the sparse information on this species by extrapolation from observations on other members of the sleeper shark family and the order Squaliformes.
Results and conclusion
The Greenland shark is viviparous and a single observation suggests a litter size of about ten. The gestation period is unknown, but embryos reach a length of around 40 cm at birth. Nutrition is derived from the yolk sac with minimal histotrophy. The surface area of the uterus is increased by villi that presumably increase in length with advancing gestation. These villi are not likely to be secretory but play a key role in the oxygen supply to the embryo. We argue that the ability of the uterus to supply oxygen is a limiting factor for litter size, which is not likely to exceed the small number reported in this and other sleeper sharks.

AB  - Sharks have historically suffered from a negative image, which has been indirectly fuelling public fear and government decisions to kill sharks, as part of bather protection programmes in various countries. Scientists are arguing, however, that the public opinion of sharks is increasingly positive, and that opposition to lethal shark control and to negative shark framing is growing. Positive attitudes and behaviour towards sharks tend to be influenced by an array of factors, which ought to be considered in studies aimed at effectively steering shark conservation actions. This study used a questionnaire survey of 1138 beach visitors in South Africa, together with structural equation modelling, to investigate human perceptions of sharks, and their influence on outcome variables including attitudes and behaviour towards shark hazard mitigation and shark framing. The results show that basic knowledge and attitudes towards sharks have a significant effect on the outcome variables. Additionally, attitudes towards sharks moderate the effect of perceived risk from sharks on the outcome variables. The results support arguments of public concern for sharks, and provide guidance for strategies aimed at garnering more support for shark conservation.

AB  - Many of the world’s shark populations are in decline, indicating the need for improved conservation and management. Well managed and appropriately located marine parks and marine protected areas (MPAs) have potential to enhance shark conservation by restricting fisheries and protecting suitable habitat for threatened shark populations. Here, we used shark occurrence records collected by commercial fisheries to determine suitable habitat for pelagic sharks within the Australian continental Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), and to quantify the amount of suitable habitat contained within existing MPAs. We developed generalised linear models using proportional occurrences of pelagic sharks for three families: Alopiidae (thresher), Carcharhinidae (requiem), and Lamnidae (mackerel) sharks. We also considered aggregated species from the Lamnidae and Carcharhinidae families (‘combined sharks’ in the models). Using a set of environmental predictors known to affect shark occurrence, including chlorophyll-a concentration, salinity, sea surface temperature, and turbidity, as well as geomorphological, geophysical, and sedimentary parameters, we found that models including sea surface temperature and turbidity were ranked highest in their ability to predict shark distributions. We used these results to predict geographic regions where habitat was most suitable for pelagic sharks within the Australian EEZ, and our results revealed that suitable habitat was limited in no-take zones within MPAs. For all shark groupings, suitable habitats were found mostly at locations exposed to fishing pressure, potentially increasing the vulnerability of the pelagic shark species considered. Our predictive models provide a foundation for future spatial planning and shark management, suggesting that strong fisheries management in addition to MPAs is necessary for pelagic shark conservation.

AB  - Species-specific bans are increasingly being implemented to stem loss of vulnerable marine species, but there is a paucity of evaluative research into resulting socio-economic and ecological consequences. In 2012, a blanket ban on landing Alopiidae (thresher) sharks was introduced in Sri Lanka. We used fisher perceptions, shown to influence support and compliance with conservation policies, to examine human responses. Data, gathered over a ten-month period in 2019 from focus groups and informal engagement during site visits, suggest support for the ban was lowest amongst fishers who perceived negative social consequences to be higher. Perceptions were also undermined by feelings of poor engagement from institutions and a lack of ecological necessity. The ban appears effective in halting targeted fisheries; however, persistent bycatch was reported by fishers. Further, bycatch appears to be widely unrecorded partly owing to mistrust and confusion amongst fishers. Occasional illegal landings were reported, seemingly motivated by interlinked factors such as good economic returns for thresher meat and high vessel running costs. The potential severity and inequity in social consequences stemming from blanket bans was highlighted, particularly when bycatch and targeted fisheries co-exist. Case study lessons are translated into a checklist containing key questions, designed to aid policy-makers to assess data provision and needs prior to introducing bans. Increasing data provision could enhance the capability of policies to predict and adapt to human behavioural responses, a key requirement considering continuing global declines in sharks despite increasing conservation effort.

AB  - Following a series of shark attacks, local authorities in Reunion Island developed an experimental shark control programme using innovative fishing gear, namely Shark Management Alert in Real Time (SMART) drumlines (SDL). From January to November 2014, four SDL were deployed 24 h per day, four days per week to target bull (Carcharhinus leucas) and tiger (Galeocerdo cuvier) sharks and to test the fishing efficacy of the SDL. Presence and residence time of 19 acoustically tagged bull and 19 tiger sharks, which had been tagged up to two years before the SDL deployment, were modelled against different SDL configurations, which included bait type and presence of bait or catches on the hooks, as well as environmental parameters before, during and after SLD deployment. There was insufficient acoustic data from the tiger sharks for any analyses. Bull sharks spent less time in nearshore waters when drumlines were deployed, and their presence was influenced by sea surface temperatures (SST), rainfall and time of day. There was no difference in the number of bull sharks detected in the SDL deployment area compared with surrounding sites. As SDL catch rates were only poorly correlated with presence of tagged sharks, their efficacy in catching sharks present in the area could not be accurately determined. Overall, the results show that SDL, deployed without chum and baited with small, whole, low-fat fish cannot be considered as “shark magnets”, which could attract dangerous bull sharks inshore where they would pose a threat to the safety of surfers and other sea users. The detection of tagged bull sharks moving into and out of the SDL fishing area indicates that these fishing devices do not provide an impenetrable barrier to the passage of this potentially dangerous species.

AB  - In coastal ecosystems, top predators are exposed to a wide variety of nutrient and contaminant sources due to the diversity of trophic webs within inshore marine habitats. Mercury contamination could represent an additional threat to shark populations that are declining worldwide. Here we measured total mercury, carbon and nitrogen isotopes, as well as mercury isotopes, in two co-occurring shark species (the bull shark Carcharhinus leucas and the tiger shark Galeocerdo cuvier) and their potential prey from a coastal ecosystem of the western Indian Ocean (La Réunion Island). Our primary goals were to (i) determine the main trophic Hg sources for sharks and (ii) better characterize their diet composition and foraging habitat. Hg isotope signatures (Δ199Hg and δ202Hg) of shark prey suggested that bull sharks were exposed to methylmercury (MeHg) produced in offshore epipelagic waters, while tiger sharks were exposed to offshore mesopelagic MeHg with additional microbial transformation in slope sediments. Δ199Hg values efficiently traced the ecology of the two predators, demonstrating that bull sharks targeted coastal prey in shallow waters while tiger sharks were mainly foraging on mesopelagic species in the deeper waters of the island slope. Unexpectedly, we found a positive shift in δ202Hg (>1‰) between sharks and their prey, leading to high δ202Hg values in the two shark species (e.g. 1.91 ± 0.52‰ in bull sharks). This large shift in δ202Hg indicates that sharks may display strong MeHg demethylation abilities, possibly reflecting evolutionary pathways for mitigating their MeHg contamination.

Owing to their tunable photoluminescence properties, carbon-based luminescent nanomaterials have shown great potential in bioimaging, photocatalysis, and biosensing among other applications.
Results
Marine environments provide excellent resources for the fabrication of these nanomaterials, because many marine organisms contain interesting trigger organic compounds that can be used as precursors. Herein, we synthesize multi-color emissive carbon dots (CDs) with an intrinsic photoluminescence quantum yield of 20.46%. These nanostructures were achieved through the one-step hydrothermal treatment of marine polysaccharide chondroitin sulfate, obtained from shark cartilage, in aqueous solution.
Conclusions
We successfully demonstrate the low toxicity of our marine resource-derived CDs in zebrafish, and provide an initial assessment of their possible use as a bioimaging agent. Notably, the newly synthesized CDs localize in the intestines of zebrafish larvae, thereby indicating their biocompatibility and potential use as in vivo dyes.

AB  - Blue shark and shortfin mako are key pelagic shark species distributed throughout the temperate and tropical waters of the world’s oceans. These species are caught in the North Pacific by Japanese longline fisheries as bycatch and occasionally targeting blue shark. Japanese research and training vessels (JRTVs) have been collecting fishery-independent data on these sharks in the western and central North Pacific since 1992. However, the catch per unit of effort (CPUE) estimated from the fishery-independent data had not been used for stock assessments due to an issue concerning reporting after the 2000s. In this study, a statistical filtering method was used to remove unreliable set-by-set data collected by JRTVs. The nominal CPUE of the JRTVs was then standardized using the spatio-temporal generalized linear mixed model to provide the spatial and temporal changes in the CPUEs of these sharks in the North Pacific. The hotspots of blue shark appeared in temperate waters of the western and central North Pacific, whereas those of shortfin mako were distributed in coastal and offshore waters along the Kuroshio-Oyashio transition zone and the Mixed Water Region. The yearly changes in the CPUE of blue shark illustrated a downward trend until 2008 and an upward trend thereafter, whereas those of shortfin mako exhibited a flat trend with large fluctuations from 1994 to 2008, and a down-and-up trend thereafter. The information predicted from the fishery-independent data is very useful for improving the stock assessment and management of these sharks as it provides an understanding of spatio-temporal changes in the hotspots and temporal changes in the catch rates.

AB  - Alternative livelihood projects are criticised as having minimal effect on biodiversity conservation. Studies are rare and where success is claimed, outcomes and reasons why projects work, have not been documented. Livelihoods are an essential element of sustainable integrated coastal management, an accepted framework for conserving coral reefs and marine resources in the tropics. It is not known whether alternative livelihood projects contribute to the goal of improving biodiversity conservation through sustainable integrated coastal management. Here, we examine Oslob Whale Sharks, an alternate livelihoods project in the Philippines built on provisioning whale sharks for community based dive tourism. We investigate how Oslob Whale Sharks contributes to sustainable integrated coastal management and whether it has any effect on biodiversity conservation. Using key stakeholder interviews with artisanal fishers, their community, local politicians and government, we found that Oslob Whale Sharks contributes to all nine factors required for sustainable integrated coastal management. Fishers and local authorities report their perception that whale sharks are protected from poaching and finning and destructive fishing has decreased, while fish abundance, pelagic fish species and catch have increased. Our findings further suggest that as there is little evidence that this type of tourism has any negative impacts on the biology or behaviour of whale sharks, Oslob Whale Sharks provides sustainable livelihoods and a delivery mechanism for sustainable integrated coastal management.

AB  - In this study, the double-faced bionic functionalized polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) membranes were successfully fabricated for the wound dressing applications. Bionic (shark skin) structure was replicated on the outer layer of PDMS membranes to form the super-hydrophobic surface for inhibiting the bacteria adhesion. Furthermore, the zwitterionic polymer (2-methacryloyloxyethyl phosphorylcholine, MPC) brushes were immobilized on the internal layer of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) modified PDMS membranes by the atmospheric plasma-induce polymerization for enhancing wound repairs and absorbing the wound exudates. The characteristics of the bionic functionalized PDMS membranes were evaluated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), contact angle (CA) measurement, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The results indicate that the bionic outer layer of PDMS membrane exhibited super-hydrophobic surface (CA: >120o) by shark skin replica, whereas the internal layer displayed super-hydrophilic surface (CA: <10°), due to the immobilization of PMPC polymer brushes on the PVA-modified PDMS membrane. Therefore, the bionic outer layer of PDMS membranes could not only avoid the external bacteria adhesion to protect the wound, but also PMPC and PVA modified internal layer can improve the hydrophilicity and biocompatibility to hasten the wound repairs.

AB  - The shortfin mako, Isurus oxyrinchus is an oceanic pelagic shark found worldwide in tropical and subtropical waters. However, the understanding of its biology at molecular level is still incipient. We sequenced the messenger RNA isolated from eye and liver tissues. De novo transcriptome yielded a total of 705,940 transcripts. A total of 3774 genes were differentially expressed (DEGs), with 1612 in the eye and 2162 in the liver. Most DEGs in the eye were related to structural and signaling functions, including nonocular and ocular opsin genes, whereas nine out of ten most overexpressed genes in the liver were related to tumor suppression, wound healing, and human diseases. Furthermore, DEGs findings provide insights on the monochromatic shark vision and a repertory of cancer-related genes, which may be insightful to elucidate shark resistance to cancer. Therefore, our results provide valuable sequence resources for future functional and population studies.

AB  - The toxicity of mercury (Hg), is generally known, and around 90% of Hg exist as methylmercury (CH3Hg+) in marine organism. Mercury concentrates in sharks and whales, which are at the top of the food chain as predators to cephalopods. The concentrations of Hg in liver and muscle of blue shark, caught in Sagami Bay, and in digestive gland and mantles of Todarodes pacificus, Sepia madokai, and Uroteuthis edulis caught in East China Sea were measured and analyzed. The Hg concentrations in the sharks, squids, and cuttlefishes determined in this study were almost same as those in the other sea regions. In addition, the Hg concentration in the blue shark was higher in the muscle than in the liver. In S. madokai and U. edulis, Hg accumulated in the digestive gland but not in the mantle. Although the Hg concentration in the digestive gland of T. pacificus is lower than those of S. madkai and U edulis, Hg concentration in the mantle is critically higher. More than 90% of Hg is present as CH3Hg+ in muscle of blue shark and mantle of T. pacificus. This feature is explained due to amino acids with the thiol groups and chain genes in the muscle of blue shark as well as in the mantle of T. pacificus. Myosin in the mantle of T. pacificus and blue shark enhances the stability of CH3Hg+. The amount of Hg in the digestive gland of T. pacificus could be too large to store; thus, Hg is released to the mantle, whereas the nutrients in the digestive gland of T. pacificus are supplied to other tissues. It is considered that the muscle fiber of T. pacificus is strong; therefore, large amounts of myosin levels may be present in T. pacificus than in S. madokai and U. edulis.

AB  - Many elasmobranch (shark and ray) species are considered threatened and their identification in processed products is important for conservation and authentication purposes. However, identification of elasmobranch species in shark cartilage pills has proven difficult using existing methodologies. The objective of this study was to develop a DNA mini-barcoding protocol using a ~130 bp region of the cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) gene for species identification in shark cartilage pills. A total of 22 shark cartilage products underwent DNA extraction in duplicate using the DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit (Qiagen). The effectiveness of a clean-up step following DNA extraction was analyzed by comparing DNA purity values and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification rates. Next, five different mini-barcode primer sets were compared based on amplification rates, and the three top-performing primer sets were used in DNA sequencing. The incorporation of a clean-up step following DNA extraction showed a slight advantage over DNA extraction alone, with a higher amplification rate (52.3% vs. 47.8%) and A260/A230 value (3.3 vs. 0.6). The three primer sets selected for DNA mini-barcoding showed DNA sequencing rates of 54.5–65.9% among the 44 duplicate samples. When the results for all three primer sets were combined, 18 of the 22 shark cartilage products were identified to the species or genus level. On an individual basis, the best-performing primer set identified 16 of the 22 products to the species or genus level. Overall, the protocol developed in this study increased the identification rate for elasmobranches in cartilage products by more than 2-fold as compared to previous research.

AB  - Shortfin mako (Isurus oxyrinchus) and blue shark (Prionace glauca) are a relevant bycatch in the Spanish surface longline fisheries that operate in the Atlantic Ocean. Concern has been raised after the 2017 and 2019 shortfin mako evaluations for the Northern Atlantic stock. It stated the population being overfished and suffering from overfishing. Also blue shark is subject to high extraction rates in the Atlantic Ocean. Few data and uncertainty in assessment results suggest that further management strategies could be taken into account for both species. This study evaluated different fisheries management strategies for shortfin mako and blue shark in the Atlantic Ocean from the stakeholders' perspective. Personal interviews were conducted with Spanish fishermen and surveys were sent to scientists and non-governmental organizations (NGOs). Local Ecological Knowledge was considered to be useful as fishermen possess unique expertise based on their continued interaction with the species and environment. Interviews allowed understanding the fishermen's perception on variations of stock abundance, distribution patterns, size of capture and seasonal fluctuations for both species. SWOT (Strength, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats)-analysis was used to study the different management measures. Main management strategies proposed by all stakeholders to reduce the bycatch of both species were spatial-temporal closure, minimum size and quotas. The Sole Bank was suggested as a temporarily closed area to protect blue shark juveniles during the summer months. The participation of stakeholders enriched the knowledge available and provided a broader data set now available for decision makers in the corresponding regional fisheries management organization (RFMOs).

AB  - In this study, we investigate the microscale structure of shark skin denticles at abdomen (A) and fin (F) locations, analyze the roughness and wetting properties related to their microstructures, and evaluate the effect of the surface properties on early bacterial attachment and biofilm formation. Microstructural analysis by scanning electron microscopy and confocal laser scanning microscopy confirmed the length (A: 165–180 μm vs. F: 145–165 μm), width (A: 86–100 μm vs. F: 64–70 μm), height (A: 10.5–13.5 μm vs. F: 6.2–8.8 μm), and density (A: 110–130 denticles/mm2 vs. F: 80–130 denticles/mm2) of the denticles. The results showed that the roughness and hydrophobicity properties were affected with slight differences in the microscale architecture. The denticles with a larger width, higher ridge, and denser overlap provided a rougher and more hydrophobic surface. The microscale structure not only affected surface properties but also the biological attachment process. The microscale topography of shark skin slightly promoted bacterial attachment at an early stage, but prevented bacteria from developing biofilms. This systematic investigation provides insights into the effects of the surface topography of shark skin on its anti-fouling mechanism, which will enable the future development of various products related to human activity, such as healthcare products, underwater devices and applications, and water treatment applications.

AB  - Sharks and rays are threatened by overfishing, yet we have little idea of the conservation status of the hundreds of Data Deficient species. Here, we developed an ecological trait model to predict the categorical conservation status of 22 Northeast Atlantic and 13 Mediterranean Sea Data Deficient sharks and rays. We first developed an explanatory cumulative link mixed model based on regionally data-sufficient species on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List of Threatened Species™ using maximum body size, median depth, and reproductive mode, then predicted the statuses of Data Deficient species. Species exclusive to the Mediterranean were 3.8 times more likely to be threatened than species exclusive to the Northeast Atlantic. Over half of Northeast Atlantic (55%, n = 12 of 22), and two-thirds of Mediterranean (62%, n = 8 of 13) Data Deficient species were predicted to be threatened. When applied to all data-sufficient species, the mean predictive accuracy was 71% and 66% for the Northeast Atlantic and Mediterranean models, respectively. Overall, Northeast Atlantic Data Deficient species are predicted to be 1.4 times more threatened than data-sufficient species proportionally (39% assessed-threatened, n = 38 of 98), whereas threat levels in the Mediterranean Sea are similarly high for both (65% assessed-threatened, n = 39 of 60 data-sufficient). With the growing availability of vertebrate trait databases, trait-based, categorical prediction of conservation status is a cost-effective approach towards incorporating Data Deficient species into unbiased (i) estimates of lineage-wide extinction rates, (ii) protected species lists, and (iii) Red List Indices, thus preventing poorly-known species from reaching extinction unnoticed.

AB  - Sharks are among the oldest vertebrate lineages in which their success has been attributed to their diversity in body shape and locomotor design. In this study, we investigated the diversity of body forms in extant sharks using landmark-based geometric morphometric analyses on nearly all the known (ca. 470) extant sharks. We ran three different analyses: the ‘full body,' ‘precaudal body,’ and ‘caudal fin' analyses. Our study suggests that there are two basic body forms in sharks, a ‘shallow-bodied’ form (Group A) and ‘deep-bodied’ form (Group B), where all sharks essentially have one basic caudal fin design of a heterocercal tail despite some specializations. We found that swimming modes in sharks are highly correlated with body forms where Group A sharks are predominantly anguilliform swimmers and Group B sharks are represented by carangiform and thunniform swimmers. The majority of Group A sharks are found to be benthic whereas pelagic forms are relatively common among Group B sharks. Each of the two superorders of sharks, Squalomorphii and Galeomorphii, must have gone through complex evolutionary history where each superorder contains both Group A sharks and Group B sharks, possibly involving parallel evolution from one group to the other or at least one episode of evolutionary reversal.

AB  - We collated and synthesized information on 1,226 Elasmobranch species (i.e., sharks, rays, and skates) globally from a wide range of sources. We obtained curated and standardized data from online databases, legal documents, press releases, and websites. All data were standardized according to the taxonomic nomenclature described in the Catalogue of Life. We grouped data into five categories: 1) biological information, 2) conservation status, 3) management opportunities, 4) use, and 5) inclusion in international conventions and treaties. For species biological information, we included migration, habitat, species characteristics such as length & body weight, their threat to humans, life-history trait data availability from FishBase, whether the species was listed on the Global Register of Migratory Species, the presence of occurrence data from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF), information on genomics from GenBank, and species evolutionary distinctiveness scores. For conservation status, we recorded threat status from the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List of Threatened Species™ and inclusion in the Alliance for Zero Extinction (AZE). For management opportunities, we identified species under human care in zoos and aquariums in the Species360 network, species under management in studbooks from the European Association of Zoos and Aquaria (EAZA), the American Association for Zoos and Aquariums (AZA), and the Zoo and Aquarium Association Australasia (ZAA), as well as data on recovery, management, and action plans at the class, family, and species levels. For use, we collated species-level data on international trade levels from the CITES (the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora) Trade Database, as used in aquaculture, as bait, and as gamefish, recording the purpose of the trade according to the IUCN Red List and the global catches reported to the FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations). Finally, we collated information from seven international conventions and treaties: CITES, UNCLOS (the United Nations Convention for the Law of the Sea), CMS (the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals), Shark MoU (the Memorandum of Understanding on the Conservation of Migratory Sharks), BERN (the Convention on the Conservation of European Wildlife and Natural Habitats), OSPAR (Protecting and conserving the North-East Atlantic and its resources), and the Barcelona Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment and the Coastal Region of the Mediterranean. Our data are comparable across databases and will assist further research on in-situ and ex-situ population management for sharks and batoids. Our data can be of use to international policy makers, aquarium curators, management authorities, conservation practitioners, and scientists interested in prioritizing Elasmobranchs for conservation.

AB  - At the 18th Conference of the Parties of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) in August 2019, shortfin and longfin mako sharks were listed on Appendix II. This listing now requires CITES parties to issue import and export permits and to closely monitor international trade in mako products. In this paper, three core arguments are being revisited that were uttered against a listing of the mako shark: that it is not scientifically justifiable; that it will cause implementation problems and will have limited conservation success; and that regional fisheries management organisations (RFMOs) are better suited to manage mako sharks. It is concluded that while the mako is not yet endangered globally, the precautionary approach justifies its listing. At the same time, although there will in all likelihood be implementation problems, the overall effect of the listing will be positive. Lastly, given their limited scope and focus on utilisation of economically valuable species, RFMOs are not well-suited for the conservation of mako sharks.

AB  - Baited video systems have been widely used to assess the relative abundance and diversity of sharks in locations around the world, however they provide limited information on behaviour. We developed and pilot tested a novel experimental approach to investigate whether repeated deployments of baited video systems in the same location could generate quantitative data on shark behavioural patterns, in the context of shark depredation (where sharks consume hooked fish). Specifically, we sought to test whether repeated exposure to boats and food in the same location would lead to a change in the arrival time and first feeding time of sharks, over a short timescale. We used the Ningaloo Marine Park (NMP) in Western Australia, a location where higher shark depredation rates have been identified in consistently fished areas, as a case study. A modified Baited Remote Underwater Video (BRUV) system was repeatedly deployed at two fished sites and two sites within a no-take marine reserve in the NMP, over six consecutive days, to mimic repeated recreational fishing and the availability of hooked fish for sharks to depredate. This approach was designed to investigate and disentangle the potential role of changes in behaviour versus variation in shark abundance, as a mechanism for how and why shark depredation can occur. Here, we report preliminary results from this methodological approach, where time of arrival and time of first feeding declined markedly in the fished site over 6 days of BRUV deployments, compared to the control site in the no-take marine reserve. A greater number of individuals from four carcharhinid species were observed at the fished site, compared to only three individuals from two species in the no-take marine reserve. The preliminary results from pilot testing of this novel experimental approach suggest that, with further modifications to identify individual sharks, and a greater spatial and temporal replication of sampling, it may be possible to identify behavioural changes occurring in sharks in the context of shark depredation. Understanding this mechanism can bring important benefits for fishers and managers, as it can lead to modifications in fishing methods designed at reducing the occurrence of behavioural changes in sharks, and thus mitigating shark depredation.

AB  - Shark populations have declined worldwide. However, the lack of data for most species makes it difficult to use conventional population assessments to estimate their status. The productivity and susceptibility analysis (PSA) has been recommended for elasmobranchs as it is a data-poor assessment that uses the best available information of the species and their fisheries to determine their vulnerability. A historical characterisation was performed to define the most important periods for the shark fishery in Campeche, southern Gulf of Mexico, and a PSA was conducted to determine the vulnerability of the eleven most important commercial shark species in each three periods. The periods were defined as: local commercialisation (1940–1979), when all species had their lowest vulnerability values, and Carcharhinus leucas, Negraprion brevirostris, and Sphyrna mokarran were classified as highly vulnerable; developed industry (1980–1998) when there was an increase of the fishing pressure, and most small species changed from low to moderate vulnerability and the large coastal sharks scored their highest vulnerability values; and declining industry (1999–2018), when all species had lower vulnerability values than in the developed industry period. However, Carcharhinus brevipinna, Ginglymostoma cirratum, N. brevisrostris, C. leucas, and S. mokarran were still classified as highly vulnerable and could be suffering the accumulative effects of decades of fishing pressure. This multidisciplinary approach serves to identify the most vulnerable species throughout the history of the fishery and to understand the vulnerability values within a historical context, avoiding the shifting baseline syndrome.

AB  - Summary
No-take marine protected areas (MPAs) are a commonly applied tool to reduce human fishing impacts on marine and coastal ecosystems. However, conservation outcomes of MPAs for mobile and long-lived predators such as sharks are highly variable. Here, we use empirical animal tracking data from 459 individual sharks and baited remote underwater video surveys undertaken in 36 countries to construct an empirically supported individual-based model that estimates the conservation effectiveness of MPAs for five species of coral reef-associated sharks (Triaenodon obesus, Carcharhinus melanopterus, Carcharhinus amblyrhynchos, Carcharhinus perezi, and Ginglymostoma cirratum). We demonstrate how species-specific individual movement traits can contribute to fishing mortality of sharks found within MPAs as they move outside to adjacent fishing grounds. We discovered that the world’s officially recorded coral reef-based managed areas (with a median width of 9.4 km) would need to be enforced as strict no-take MPAs and up to 5 times larger to expect protection of the majority of individuals of the five investigated reef shark species. The magnitude of this effect depended on local abundances and fishing pressure, with MPAs required to be 1.6–2.6 times larger to protect the same number of Atlantic and Caribbean species, which occur at lower abundances than similar species in the western Pacific. Furthermore, our model was used to quantify partially substantial reductions (>50%) in fishing mortality resulting from small increases in MPA size, allowing us to bridge a critical gap between traditional conservation planning and fisheries management. Overall, our results highlight the challenge of relying on abundance data alone to ensure that estimates of shark conservation impacts of MPAs follow the precautionary approach.

AB  - The surface integrity and structural characteristics of titanium alloy blades have great influence on the aerodynamic performance of aero-engines. It has been proved that shark-skin bio-inspired riblets can improve the aerodynamic performance of parts by 10%. At present, the process of this structure is mainly formed by laser, rolling, etc., and the above processing methods have low efficiency, poor surface integrity and other problems. Belt grinding is widely used in surface polishing of titanium alloy blades, which plays an important role in improving the surface integrity. However, it is difficult to guarantee the surface’s microstructure characteristics. Therefore, combining the advantages of laser processing, the U-shaped structure produced by laser assisted belt grinding processing of shark skin is proposed. Firstly, based on the characteristics of the structure, a laser assisted belt grinding processing method is proposed and the forming process of the surface structure is analyzed. Then the experiments of titanium alloy plates with different surface roughness were carried out. Finally, the U-shaped structure is analyzed by white light interferometer. The experimental results show that the ratio of depth to width is h/s=0.4~0.6, the surface structure is mainly U-shaped structure, and the machining error is less than 10%. So this method can be used for the processing of U-shaped structure.

AB  - Heavy metals may adversely affect health in marine organisms. As top predators, sharks may be especially vulnerable to exposure over long lifespans. Here we evaluate plasma levels of 14 heavy metals and 12 trace elements in white sharks, Carcharodon carcharias, in South Africa to determine whether they are related to sex, body size, and/or body condition and other health parameters. High levels of mercury and arsenic were found in shark blood at levels considered toxic in other vertebrates. Heavy metal concentrations were not related to body size or sex. Metal concentrations were not related to body condition with exception of copper, which was positively correlated. Protective effects of elements such as selenium, zinc, and iron were not detected. No negative effects on health parameters, such as total leukocytes or granulocyte to lymphocyte ratios were observed. Results suggest that sharks may have protective mechanisms that mitigate harmful effects of heavy metal exposure, providing new opportunities for future studies.

(Lamniformes, Carchariidae). The specimen originates from Maastrichtian strata on the island of Shikotan that are assigned to the Malokurilsk Formation. It constitutes an extremely rare find from rocks of this age in the northwest Pacific region. External and internal dental structures have been reconstructed by the use of computed tomography. The vasculature of this lamniform tooth is first modelled by CT scanning and shown under different angles, which allows an assessment of the spatial arrangement of hierarchically organised vascular channels in this holaulacorhize tooth.

KW  - Communication
AB  - Sharks are high-profile taxa and often polarise communities and stakeholders. However, constructive debate around shark issues has been stymied by the many stakeholders with conflicting or unclear objectives: Government Agencies with multiple objectives (sustainable management, conservation, public safety); fishers (commercial and recreational) that target certain species of sharks, or try to avoid interactions; tourism operators; indigenous peoples with cultural links; conservation groups; other ocean-users and members of the general public who may be shark-conservationists or shark-cull advocates. The confusion appears partly due to various stakeholder groups using the collective noun ‘sharks’ when discussing issues. The use of ‘sharks’ confuses debates in a way similar to other totemic taxa (e.g. whales) where unique attributes of multiple species have been combined. In the case of ‘sharks’ the situation is exacerbated by the large number of species (globally >500), the diversity of values attributed to species and the ability of stakeholders to have multiple values (e.g. fishers who regard sharks as desirable target species and as depredators of target species). We argue that ‘sharks’ extend the super-species concept, reducing clarity and hindering the development of more broadly acceptable policies. To improve this discourse we suggest that stakeholders define ‘sharks’ in discussions and reports with species-by-area descriptors (e.g. white-sharks in Western Australia); or as a minimum, on a defined group-by-area basis (e.g. sharks that support eco-tourism in South Africa; commercially important species of sharks in southern Australia), so the species in focus is (are) clearly defined, allowing future debates to be more constructive and support the development of more widely-acceptable policies.

AB  - Indoleamine 2 3-dioxygenase (IDO) is a protein usually described in mammals, which, among other functions, participates in the maternal-fetal tolerance process. The blue-shark, Prionace glauca (Linnaeus, 1758) is a viviparous placentary species in which the yolk sac develops during the pregnancy, turning into a placenta for matrotrophic nutrition of the embryo. The purpose of this study was to investigate the expression of IDO in the P. glauca maternal-fetal interface along three gestation phases and describe its distribution and the meaning of its presence. The results showed IDO labelling during the yolk sac/placenta development in the ectoderm on the three development phases and in the endoderm at the two first phases. In the uterine epithelium, IDO was observed in the last two phases. These interface tissues are major contact areas between the mother and the semiallogeneic conceptus and this relation could induce an immunological response against the fetus. Therefore, the presence of IDO may indicate that it could have a similar role in the mechanism of maternal-fetal tolerance in the P. glauca placental interface, as described in eutherian mammals.

AB  - Shark encounters while fishing in Western Australian waters have been perceived to be increasing by some fishers in recent years. A lack of quantitative information remains a significant obstacle to determining the nature and magnitude of these encounters. A probability-based survey was implemented to assess the occurrence of and attitudes toward shark encounters by commercial fishers, charter tour operators and private boat-based recreational fishers during 2015/16. Of the 906 fishers interviewed, 52% indicated they had experienced at least one shark encounter while fishing during the previous year. The loss or damage of fish was involved in over half of these encounters while charter fishing and nearly a third while recreational fishing. The level of concern towards shark depredation was highest among charter tour operators state-wide and all sectors in the Gascoyne bioregion. Multiple logistic regression analyses indicated fishing method and bioregion were the most important predictors of encounters. Depredation through fish loss below or at the surface was highest for pelagic or demersal line fishing in the North Coast and Gascoyne bioregions. Overwhelmingly, the majority of fishers in all sectors were satisfied with their fishing experience despite the occurrence of shark encounters. Future research on shark depredation would benefit from focusing on fishing methods and bioregions where depredation events were highest, with consideration of associated behavioural and environmental characteristics likely to influence depredation rates. The approach outlined here could easily be applied to other human-wildlife interaction studies where representative views of stakeholders are required for policy development and effective management.

AB  - The global demand for shark and ray products has fuelled a lucrative international trade, driving large population declines as a consequence. This high-volume trade exceeds the capacity of nations to monitor their trade and enforce international trade regulations, leaving them susceptible to international trade sanctions. Here, a multi-criteria decision analysis was used to examine global trade levels and regulatory controls associated with the world's shark and ray trade to prioritize international genetic capacity building assistance to implement the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) Appendix II shark and ray listings. A total of 76 nations were identified as priority nations to collaborate in a genetic implementation program. Improving the capacity of nations to detect CITES Appendix II shark and rays bound for international markets using a genetic program can aid as an additional tool to enhance trade-monitoring and enforcement efforts to improve the conservation and management of commercially important and threatened shark and ray populations.

We present the case of a 42-year-old man who sustained a hand laceration after being bitten by a blacktip reef shark. He underwent complex primary wound closure in an austere environment and received prophylactic antibiotics. No infection developed and he recovered fully.
Why Should an Emergency Physician Be Aware of This?
We discuss our rationale in closing the wound aboard the dive boat, the choice of antibiotics, and review marine pathogens.

AB  - Oceanic sharks are vulnerable to overexploitation due to their life-history strategies, and efforts to protect them in the wild have been stalled by transjurisdictional conflicts of interest. The pelagic thresher shark (Alopias pelagicus) is one such species that visits a seamount in the Philippines where its dependable presence has catalysed a burgeoning dive tourism industry and the designation of a conservation area. Nothing is known of the range and turnover of this population, but the regularity with which these sharks interact with cleaner wrasse on the seamount provides important stability for regional businesses that lack empirical knowledge of their vulnerability. We fitted 14 pelagic thresher sharks with acoustic tags and monitored their fine scale movements for 66 days (June to mid-August 2014). Individuals were present at the seamount for 32% of their days at liberty, and 42% of the tagged sharks were still being detected there at the end of the study. Thresher sharks showed preferences for visiting specific locations on the seamount where they interact with cleaner fish, and estimates of their fidelity to these sites provided scalars for visual census. Pelagic thresher sharks moved away from the seamount after early morning visits to cleaning stations using swim speeds of 3.79 km h−1 (±SD 1.43). These movements demonstrated that they have access to the jurisdictional waters of five provincial territories when dispersing from and returning to the seamount on a diurnal basis. While the seamount offers cleaner-associated services and refuge provision for pelagic thresher sharks, their scale of movement leaves them vulnerable to fisheries that operate in the region. Natural history observations provide context and reveal bias for their application in the management and conservation of this rare and vulnerable shark species.

The effect of added WS2 on the microstructure and mechanical properties of ZrO2 coatings was examined and the dry sliding wear and friction behaviors against commercial AISI1045 steel balls were investigated. After adding WS2, the micro hardness of ZrO2 coating decreased by ~39% (from 23.7 GPa to 14.5 GPa), and the average steady state friction coefficient was decreased from ~0.43 to ~ 0.2. When the ZrO2/WS2 coating surface was textured biomimetic shark skin, nearly 66% decrease of the average steady state friction coefficient and 82% decrease of ball wear rate were obtained as compared with the pure ZrO2 coatings. The possible frictional mechanism of the biomimetic shark-skin structures was discussed.

In this study, stereo-Baited Remote Underwater Videos (stereo-BRUVs) were deployed to collect ecological data from New Zealand deep-sea sharks. The results showed differences in abundance between species, with Etmopterus granulosus (Etmopteridae) found in greatest numbers. Moreover, the known depth range increased for Scymnodon macracanthus (Centrophiridae). Deep-sea shark species were generally found to swim at slower cruise speeds (0.36 ± 0.04 m s−1) than their shallow-water counterparts (0.63 ± 0.05 m s−1). However, the swimming speed of deep-sea sharks was clearly not uniform, with some species displaying higher cruise swimming speeds than others. The fastest sharks (Centrophorus harrissoni, Etmopterus granulosus and Etmopterus molleri) had swimming abilities comparable to benthic shallow water sharks (0.48 ± 0.02 m s−1). The higher cruise swimming speed in the family Etmopteridae could be an advantage for these luminous sharks if they follow isolumes to match their ventral light intensity with the down-welling light of their environment. This study revealed that alternative non-destructive methods can be effective for ecological studies of deep-sea marine fauna.

AB  - In a context where the problem of plastic pollution is globally increasing, more studies are needed to assess the real impact in oceanic megafauna. Here, we reported on the incidence of plastic and also retained hooks in two species of commercially exploited pelagic sharks in two ocean basins, the North Atlantic and South Pacific. In the South Pacific, 1.18% of caught blue sharks were observed with plastic debris on their body and 4.82% and with retained hooks, while 0.00% of shortfin makos had plastic debris and 1.76% were recorded with retained hooks. In the North Atlantic, 0.21% of blue sharks had plastic debris and 0.37% of blue, and 0.78% of shortfin makos were observed with retained hooks.

AB  - Long-term trends in shark abundance offer important insights for fisheries management. Few fisheries-independent, extended time-series data exist for coastal shark species in the northwest Atlantic Ocean or Caribbean outside of the United States. A decades old dataset comprised of standardized longline surveys provided us with the opportunity to characterize diversity and evaluate changes in the relative abundance of sharks in the eastern Bahamas between 1979–1990 and 2011–2013. Caribbean reef sharks Carcharhinus perezi and tiger sharks Galeocerdo cuvier were the two most commonly captured species throughout the survey and were the only two species analyzed in detail. For both species, sex ratios favored females. Using Bayesian generalized linear models, we found that Caribbean reef shark catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) exhibited a positive relationship with year and temperature, while size exhibited no relationship with year and a negative relationship with temperature. There was no relationship between tiger shark CPUE and year but there was a positive relationship between size and year. These results are presented in the context of Bahamian shark conservation efforts and the results of other surveys in the region.

AB  - In the search for new subsea oil fields, geologists use vessels to tow streamer cables, which collects seismic data. This activity attracts bull sharks to the magnetic streamer fields causing shark attacks and hence losses and delays. This paper discusses how shark attacks on streamer cables can be modelled and simulated in cable design and optimization processes. In order to generate a representative simulation model, a large and authentic bull shark jaw was 3D-scanned. The shark jaw was converted to a CAD-model utilizing reverse engineering applications. Numerical models of the streamer cables, capturing the response with respect to friction properties and failure criteria’s, were benchmarked using quasi-static compression tests. Additionally, dynamic bite and impact simulations replicating the shark attack on streamer cables have been conducted. The physical compression tests and simulations show that the streamer cable FE-models are valid. The results indicate that a shark bite can be sufficient to critically damage the cable, but the bite resilience of the streamer cable is strongly correlated to the shark speed upon impact.

AB  - Persistent organic pollutants (POPs), including Perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs), enter into the marine ecosystem, raising questions on possible adverse effects caused to the health of marine organisms and especially of top predators. Thus, there is an urge to assess the occurrence and the tissue distribution of PFASs in apex predators. To this end, the current study examines concentrations and distribution of 15 PFASs among 85 samples of different tissues from 9 shark and ray species collected in Greece. The results showed a similar PFAS pattern among the different tissues, with long carbon chain PFASs being the most frequently detected compounds. PFTrDA was the most predominant compound in terms of concentration and frequency of detection, followed by PFUnDA and PFOS. PFTrDA concentrations ranged between < LOQ and 27.1 ng/g ww, while PFUnDA and PFOS levels ranged from <LOQ to 16.0 and < LOQ to 21.6 ng/g ww, respectively. Regarding their frequency of detection, PFTrDA and PFUnDA were detected in 98% and 91% of the samples, respectively, while PFOS was detected in 79%. ΣPFAS concentrations in each analysed tissue ranged from 0.3 to 85 ng/g ww, with the latter being detected in the liver of angular roughshark (Oxynotus centrina). On average, PFASs were found to be accumulated in tissues in the following order: gonads > heart > liver ≈ gills > muscle. Relative contribution (%) of individual compounds to ΣPFAS concentration varied among the different shark tissues, and also among the different shark species. No correlation between PFASs levels in tissues and sharks’ gender, length and geographical origin was observed.

AB  - Developing and enhancing non-lethal methods for sampling species of high conservation concern, including marine megafauna, has prompted the development of numerous biopsy methods to collect tissue for biochemical analyses. However, many of these analyses require adequately-sized muscle cores for reliable results. Here, we developed and trialed a novel modification to a biopsy probe traditionally limited to underwater use, which enables sampling of free-swimming sharks from above the surface. The modified probe used collected similar amounts of white shark, Carcharodon carcharias, muscle and sub-dermal tissue above water as the traditional underwater probe (muscle: 0.36 g vs. 0.44 g; sub-dermal tissue: 0.62 g vs. 0.44 g for surface and underwater respectively). Both methods obtained sufficient tissue for several analyses to be run on the same tissue core (e.g. stable isotopes, fatty acids, and genetics). This encourages the use of this biopsy probe, with studies assessing stock structure, trophic ecology, or physiology. The described modification adapts the probe to allow above-water deployment, providing more opportunities for effective, non-lethal sampling of free-swimming sharks.

AB  - As Earth’s temperature continues to rise, sudden warming events, designated as marine heatwaves (MHWs), are becoming more frequent and longer. This phenomenon is already shown to significantly impact marine ecosystems and respective fauna. While experimental acclimation to higher temperatures is known to affect predatory behavior, metabolism and overall fitness of sharks, the effects of short-term exposure to high temperatures on sharks’ physiology has yet to be investigated in a MHW context. Thus, the aim of our work was to study the impact of a category II MHW (Δ3 °C, 15 days) on: i) hematological parameters (total erythrocytes, leukocytes, thrombocytes, erythrocyte nuclear abnormalities (ENAs) counts, and nucleus to cytoplasmic ratio), ii) heart and spleen to body ratios, and iii) ventilation rates of juvenile catsharks (Scyliorhinus canicula). We found that MHW exposure led to significant changes in normal blood cell counts, by lowering erythrocyte counts and nucleus to cytoplasm ratio, and increasing leukocyte and thrombocyte counts. Moreover, ventilation rates increased consistently over the course of the MHW. However, there were no changes regarding the presence of ENA, as well as spleen and heart to body ratios. Our findings indicate limited capabilities for coping with sudden warming events, suggesting potential disruption in shark physiological homeostasis as the frequency, duration and intensity of MHWs are expected to be strengthened.

AB  - White Shark watching tourism at natural aggregation sites is an increasingly popular activity globally among marine wildlife enthusiasts. This wildlife tourism activity promotes conservation and economic development but information on the design of adequate and sustainable management practices is missing. Management of the White Shark Observation Activity (WSOA) at Guadalupe Island, Mexico, in an international context was explored. The actors involved in the WSOA as well as the power relationships among them were investigated. Actors helped to elucidate the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats of the WSOA. Tourist Operators, Tourists, a Fishing Cooperative, Non-Governmental Organizations, Academia, and Federal Government institutions were identified as the main groups of actors. All the actors agreed that they have an interest in the use of resources and their conservation but their needs and some perspectives of management differed. An imbalance of power among actors was found, with Federal Governmental institutions holding most power, possibly hindering collective management actions. It is necessary to adapt a management plan that promotes a vision for the future and the integration of the concerns and perspectives of the stakeholders to ensure the sustainability of the WSOA.

AB  - Summary
Sharks are a taxon of significant conservation concern and associated public interest. The scientific community largely supports management policies focusing on sustainable fisheries exploitation of sharks, but many concerned members of the public and some environmental advocates believe that sustainable shark fisheries cannot and do not exist and therefore support total bans on all shark fisheries and/or trade in shark products. The belief that sustainable shark fisheries cannot and do not exist persists despite scientific evidence showing that they can and do, and are important to livelihoods. Additionally, many concerned members of the public are only aware of one threat to sharks and are unaware of other threats—or of most available policy solutions. Here we assess whether the popular press plays a role in spreading misinformation and misunderstanding about these issues via the agenda-setting, priming, and cultivation roles of the media, with the goal of better understanding the causes and consequences of public confusion.

AB  - Management of human-wildlife conflict is often challenging and complex, particularly when the conflict involves sharks. New technologies are being trialled in New South Wales, on Australia's east coast, to accommodate the community demand for increased beach-user protection that does not harm marine wildlife. Drones (or unmanned aerial vehicles), are one of a suite of potential tools that can address both these demands. We released an online survey to assess beach-user perceptions and attitudes toward drones on NSW beaches as a shark surveillance tool. From 439 respondents, we found the use of drones on coastal beaches was accepted by the majority of people surveyed (88%) due to perceptions of reduced impact on sharks, and the relatively low cost. Drone surveillance was also the preferred approach for bather protection overall. Arguably the most vulnerable beach-user group for a shark bite incident, surfers, claimed the highest level of awareness of the use of drones for shark surveillance, but also indicated lower confidence in their utility compared to other groups. The study demonstrates an overall social licence regarding the use of drones for shark surveillance purposes, with the levels of support likely to increase with further public education efforts and improvements to the efficacy of drone-based surveillance.

AB  - Worldwide shark populations have experienced rapid declines over the last decades, mainly due to overfishing. Marine protected areas (MPAs) have thus become an indispensable tool for the protection of these marine predators. Two recently-created MPAs in the Northeast Pacific Ocean, the Revillagigedo National Park and Clipperton Atoll, are characterized by different trophic structures potentially influencing the trophic niche and contaminant exposure of resident sharks in these two sites. In this context, we used carbon (δ13C) and nitrogen (δ15N) stable isotope analyzes as well as total mercury concentrations ([THg]) to assess the effect of foraging site on the trophic niche and Hg levels of juvenile silvertip (ST) sharks Carcharhinus albimarginatus. Analyzing fin clip samples from Revillagigedo and Clipperton, we found that shark δ15N varied spatially in relation to δ15N baselines, suggesting similar trophic position in both MPAs. Moreover, δ13C values indicated that ST sharks from Revillagigedo would feed on different food webs (i.e. both benthic and pelagic) while individuals from Clipperton would only rely on benthic food webs. These differences between MPAs led to a weak overlap of isotopic niches between the two populations, highlighting the site residency of juvenile ST sharks. Within each population, [THg] was not correlated with trophic tracers (δ15N and δ13C) and was also similar between populations. This study revealed no influence of site or food web in [THg] and raises the question of the origin of Hg exposure for reef shark populations in the Northeast Pacific Ocean.

AB  - Shark fin is one of Asia's most valued dried seafood products, with over 80 shark species traded in Hong Kong [HK]. We analyzed processed shark fins from mainland China and HK markets (n = 267) for mercury, methyl‑mercury, and arsenic, to inform consumers, policy makers and public health officials on the health risks of ingesting fins from nine of the most common shark species in the fin trade. Fins from all species frequently exceed Hg limits established by HK authorities. Most of the mercury found is in the form of methyl‑mercury (69.0 ± 33.5%). Five species surpass methyl‑mercury PTWIs and blue shark fins can exceed inorganic arsenic BMDL0.5. Species-of-origin was a significant predictor of heavy metal concentrations, with higher mercury concentrations associated with coastal sharks and lower arsenic levels found with increasing shark trophic level. Species-specific labeling would help consumers avoid shark fin products that pose the highest health risk.

Average Hg concentrations in neonates and juveniles (all values in μg g−1 w.w.) were found to be 0.115 and 0.129 respectively, below the maximum permissible limit of 1 μg g−1 set by the Mexican government. However, excess Se values (all values in μg g−1 d.w.) observed in neonates (5.366) and juveniles (2.815) prove to maintain antioxidant ability by inducing Hg excretion and reducing its toxicity. Calculated Biomagnification Factor (BMFTL) denoted high values for the prey C.hippurus, signifying absolute magnification of Hg and Se along the food chain. This study provides key toxicological evidences of Hg- Se interaction and their effects in marine systems and human health.

AB  - Sharks are well known to scavenge whale carcasses, but observations are rare. Here we (1) describe new observations of whale carcass scavenging behaviour by white (Carcharodon carcharias) and tiger (Galeocerdo cuvier) sharks, and (2) review the scientific and grey literature on the topic. Our new observations are from the east coast of New South Wales, Australia and include a sperm whale (Physeter microcephalus) carcass in 2015, a humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae) carcass and fin whale (Balaenoptera physalus) carcass in 2018. Analysis of these observations revealed that feeding preferences differed among whale species for each species of shark. Feeding behaviour (including test biting, head shaking, palatoquadrate protrusion, ocular rotation and nictitating membrane use) were employed by both tiger and white sharks, with little inter or intraspecific aggression. Behaviour of sharks scavenging whale carcasses differs in the primary literature depending on whale carcass and species of shark present. Most of our results support past observations regarding feeding behaviours and little inter or intraspecific aggression. However, our results differed from past events. We observed increased palatoquadrate protrusion by white sharks and avoidance of flukes or pectoral fins feeding by tiger and white sharks. Review of the literature demonstrates that scavenging events are more commonly reported in grey literature than in scientific documents.

AB  - Shark-diving tourism is a fast-growing industry that provides socio-economic benefits to local communities. This study estimated the economic contribution of the shark-diving tourism in the Maldives by using surveys with dive tourists and dive operators. Direct business revenue from shark divers was estimated to be US$14.4 million. Revenues to local businesses associated with travel expenses of shark divers were estimated to be US$51.4 million. Further economic benefits from shark-diving occurred in form of annual business tax revenues of US$7.2 million and annual salaries to employees working in the diving industry of US$4.1 million. These values were compared with the business revenues from shark-diving in the Maldives in 1992 to assess how the shark-diving industry has changed over time. The results of this study indicate that the business revenues of this industry have almost doubled (when inflation adjusted) over the last 24 years confirming its economic growth and importance for the Maldives. Effective management of shark dive operations is crucial for maintaining the value and sustainability of this tourism industry to improve ongoing conservation efforts for shark populations.

AB  - This study aimed to locate the adults, and thus also the definitive hosts, of three species of marine mammal-parasitising larval cestodes that have molecular affinities with Clistobothrium. New collections led to the discovery of adults of two new species of Clistobothrium, one from the longfin mako shark and one from the salmon shark. New material of Clistobothrium tumidum was collected from the great white shark and new material of a previously reported undescribed species of Clistobothrium was collected from the porbeagle shark. Larvae of Clistobothrium were opportunistically collected from sockeye salmon and four species of small squaliform sharks. Sequence data for the D1–D3 region of the 28S rDNA gene were generated for all but one of these taxa. The tree resulting from maximum likelihood analysis of those data, in combination with comparable data from GenBank, indicates that squaliform sharks can serve as intermediate hosts for the species from the porbeagle shark. The larvae from salmon exhibit a unique molecular signature, and based on diet data, may be conspecific with adults from the salmon shark. Informed by sequence data for new material of Monorygma and existing data for Phyllobothrium, the larvae provisionally identified as Monorygma grimaldii and Phyllobothrium delphini were formally transferred to Clistobothrium. Especially puzzling was that the molecular signatures of none of the eight species of Clistobothrium match those of the three marine mammal-parasitising larval forms. We are at a loss as to where else to look for the three corresponding adult forms. The great white shark remains the most likely candidate given it consumes marine mammals with some regularity, but seems unlikely to host five species of Clistobothrium. Alternatively, we are left wondering if the large marine mammal predator Carcharocles megalodon may not be extinct after all…

AB  - Selective removal of problem individuals following shark bite incidents would be consistent with current management practices for terrestrial predators, and would be more effective and more environmentally responsible than current mass-culling programs. In parallel, and in addition to traditional forensics analysis, we recommend the routine collection of shark DNA from wounds or devices following shark bite incidents in order to genetically identify the individual responsible. This approach would require creating an extensive database of shark identities in high-risk areas against which to compare DNA forensically recovered from shark bite incidents. At a local and regional scale, we propose utilizing existing shark tagging programs and artificial shark aggregation sites to collect DNA, behavioural and morphological data for the database, and to facilitate removal of problem individuals. In several places around the world, selective removal of problem individuals would not be significantly more expensive and definitely less environmentally-destructive than traditional approaches and would also help reconcile people and sharks by underlining individuality in shark behaviour.

AB  - Sharks exhibit peculiar characteristics, which may lead to overfishing to cause irreversible damage to stocks and failing to restore original population sizes. Although global fin trade has decreased since 2000 meat trade has increased, with Brazil figuring as the largest shark meat importer worldwide. Still, in Brazil, elasmobranchs are traded under the label “cação” making it difficult to monitor what species are actually being traded. To overcome elasmobranch fraudulent trade, molecular techniques have been developed aiding in illegal trade monitoring. Therefore, the objective of the present study was apply DNA barcoding technique (COI analysis) as a molecular support tool for the identification of shark species commercialized in the main fish markets of southern Brazil. A total of 650 base pairs (bp) of barcode COI from 231 samples were sequenced and analyzed, identifying 16 different elasmobranch species, being 12 shark species and four batoid species. About 43.3% of the total sampled consists of species listed in some IUCN risk category (e.g. Carcharias taurus, Carcharhinus falciformis, Sphyrna lewini, S. zygaena, Squatina guggenheim). A key step for conservation would be encourage the consumer to demand the correct identification of the meat consumed. Such an attitude may influence the decision of supermarkets and fish markets to purchase only correctly identified products, which in turn would lead to the need for specialists actively and constantly working alongside fishery landings.

AB  - Understanding the human dimensions of recreational fisheries is critical to the development of effective fisheries management regulations. This study aimed to characterize Australian shortfin mako shark (Isurus oxyrinchus) anglers in terms of their gear use, perceptions on circle hooks, perceptions on sharks and shark conservation, and attitudes towards fisheries management. A targeted web survey was completed by 272 shortfin mako anglers distributed across southeastern Australia. Responses were compared across angler subgroups in relation to their state of residence, membership to an angling club, and tendency to release or keep captured sharks. Overall, anglers' perceptions about how their fishing behaviours and gear choices may affect the survival of released shortfin mako sharks were quite in line with existing scientific knowledge though anglers believed their behaviours have less of an impact on shark stocks than other threats such as commercial fisheries. Gear selection was determined largely by fishing preference (harvest or catch-and-release) of the angler, with those practicing catch-and-release more frequently using circle hooks. State of residence also influenced the perceptions of anglers towards sharks and shark survival as well as their attitudes towards fisheries management. Angler support for precautionary management suggests that a better understanding of the potential impacts of recreational fishing on shark stocks may assist in promoting greater accountability and responsible fishing practices amongst these resource users; however, improved communication between recreational fishers, management authorities, and fisheries scientists is a necessary precursor to this step.

AB  - Filling ecological and social data gaps for small-scale fisheries is crucial for global conservation of shark species. In 2016, international protection of vulnerable smooth hammerhead sharks (Sphyrna zygaena) resulted in a seasonal fishing ban to protect juvenile sharks in Peru's small-scale fisheries. Richer data on the fisheries' social-ecological dynamics are necessary to understand fishery impacts and the ban's efficacy. Semi-structured interviews with 88 Peruvian gillnetters revealed that fishers are cognizant of their impacts on the hammerhead population and further, that historical fishery impacts on the species are more severe than reflected in official records. On balance, respondents welcome conservation measures: 76% of respondents were in favor of the ban. However, most respondents also voiced objections to the ban, with unfairness emerging as a central theme including with regards to impracticality, economic severity, ecological necessity, and the burden of compliance. These objections may directly and indirectly stem from a lack of transparency and fisher participation in the ban development-and-implementation process. Fishers suggested alternative or additional options for hammerhead management, such as minimum sizes or dynamic “move-on” spatial closures. These results point to the benefits of a participatory process that engages fishers in practical and more equitable conservation solutions.

AB  - Incidental capture of sharks during commercial and recreational fishing is of major conservation concern because of the potential effects it can have on physiological stress responses and survival. Endocrine aspects of the stress response are, however, poorly understood in elasmobranchs because of difficulties in measuring the primary glucocorticoid (1α-hydroxycorticosterone). Here, we combined measures of plasma adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), the highly conserved pituitary hormone responsible for stimulating the release of adrenal/interrenal glucocorticoids, with measures of plasma lactate, osmolality, hematocrit, and behavior to gain a greater understanding of the capture stress response in Atlantic Sharpnose sharks, Rhizoprionodon terraenovae. Individuals were subject to a non-repeated measures blood sampling protocol in which blood samples were obtained following exposure to capture stress for <3 min (designated baseline), and 15, 30, 45 and 60 min, after which behavior was categorized during release. Results revealed that ACTH was significantly higher at 15, 30, 45, and 60 min than at baseline. Lactate levels were highest at 45 and 60 min whereas osmolality and hematocrit did not differ significantly among the sampling periods. Lactate was the only variable to significantly predict the shark's behavior upon release with higher lactate levels correlating with sluggish behavior. Measurements of stress indicators are important in understanding the effects of capture on shark populations, which has been implicated in population declines.

AB  - Legislation to ban the targeted fishing of sharks is frequently employed within developing coastal nations. These Shark Large Marine Protected Areas (SLMPAs) are established primarily to alleviate the direct threats that humans pose to sharks through activities such as overfishing and destructive fishing practices. However, despite the anthropogenic nature of these threats, socioeconomic factors are often given less consideration than their ecological counterparts when designating SLMPAs. In this paper, we identified and examined relevant national-level socioeconomic data to determine the challenges and opportunities associated with implementing SLMPAs, focussing on least developed and low income countries. We aimed to use these socioeconomic data to identify nations where SLMPAs are more likely to be successful in providing conservation benefits to sharks. We used principal component analysis to develop two national-level indices that represent these anticipated opportunities and challenges for implementing SLMPAs across 87 coastal nations. The Opportunity Index identifies those nations in which socioeconomic conditions such as adaptive capacity, and strong and fair governance, are favourable for SLMPAs to provide conservation benefits to sharks. The Challenge Index identifies those nations that may not yet be in a position developmentally to support communities to adapt to a loss of access to resources associated with SLMPAs, or to manage and enforce broad scale restrictive legislation. In combination with biophysical considerations, the Challenge and Opportunity indices presented here can support policy makers in deciding whether, and in what cases, SLMPAs are the most appropriate measure to provide conservation benefits to sharks.

AB  - Peptidylarginine deiminases (PADs) are phylogenetically conserved calcium-dependent enzymes which post-translationally convert arginine into citrulline in target proteins in an irreversible manner, causing functional and structural changes in target proteins. Protein deimination causes generation of neo-epitopes, affects gene regulation and also allows for protein moonlighting. Extracellular vesicles are found in most body fluids and participate in cellular communication via transfer of cargo proteins and genetic material. In this study, post-translationally deiminated proteins and extracellular vesicles (EVs) are described for the first time in shark plasma. We report a poly-dispersed population of shark plasma EVs, positive for phylogenetically conserved EV-specific markers and characterised by TEM. In plasma, 6 deiminated proteins, including complement and immunoglobulin, were identified, whereof 3 proteins were found to be exported in plasma-derived EVs. A PAD homologue was identified in shark plasma by Western blotting and detected an expected 70 kDa size. Deiminated histone H3, a marker of neutrophil extracellular trap formation, was also detected in nurse shark plasma. This is the first report of deiminated proteins in plasma and EVs, highlighting a hitherto unrecognized post-translational modification in key immune proteins of innate and adaptive immunity in shark.

AB  - Large predators exert control on lower trophic levels, often influencing long-term changes in community structure. Many large predators are highly mobile and occur in habitats along a continuum of presence and absence. In many natural systems, the movement of large predators through an area has been shown to lead to rapid changes in prey distribution through trait-mediated behavioral responses. To test whether a similar interaction also occurs for artificial habitats, we examined how reef fish community metrics (abundance, species richness, community composition) varied with the presence of a large coastal shark (sand tiger shark, Carcharias taurus). Remotely-operated vehicle surveys of large sharks and reef fishes on shipwrecks along the North Carolina, USA, continental shelf revealed that short-term shark presence correlated with changes in reef fish community metrics. Specifically, when sharks were present, fish species abundance and richness did not differ compared to when sharks were absent. Finer-scale analyses near sharks revealed similar abundance but elevated species richness proximate to sharks. We confirmed that this fine-scale pattern of similar abundance but higher richness near sharks held when the ROV was not in the water by repeating analyses using time-lapse videos from nearby shipwrecks. The detected differences in fish community metrics in the presence of sharks correlated with higher numbers of water-column associated species, such as jacks and barracuda, but lower numbers of benthic-associated species, including seabass and grouper. These findings suggest that the presence of large predators on artificial structures, as in natural systems, can drive short-term changes in community structure.

The response's premise that non-artisanal shark fisheries cannot be sustainable is false. Pending legislation in the USA Congress to prohibit imports of shark products from nations practicing unsustainable shark fishing provides a more reasonable and effective path forward for domestic and global shark conservation. Shiffman & Hueter's findings stand and are helping to inform this better path.

AB  - The visual sense of elasmobranch fishes is poorly studied compared to their bony cousins, the teleosts. Nevertheless, the elasmobranch eye features numerous specialisations that have no doubt facilitated the diversification and evolutionary success of this fascinating taxon. In this review, I highlight recent discoveries on the nature and phylogenetic distribution of visual pigments in sharks and rays. Whereas most rays appear to be cone dichromats, all sharks studied to date are cone monochromats and, as a group, have likely abandoned colour vision on multiple occasions. This situation in sharks mirrors that seen in other large marine predators, the pinnipeds and cetaceans, which leads us to reassess the costs and benefits of multiple cone pigments and wavelength discrimination in the marine environment.

In this study, a hybrid optimization technique is presented for developing a high efficiency technique for the fusion of the medical images. The presented method uses both advantages of the wavelet transform and the homomorphic filter for improving the system efficiency. For achieving the optimal values of the system, a new optimization algorithm based on two new introduced methods, shark smell optimization algorithm and world cup optimization algorithm is introduced. The new algorithm is then applied to the wavelet part of the system to get the optimal values. Simulations are applied on two classes of five clinical images including MR-CT, MR-SPECT, and MR-PET the results are compared with six popular methods. The final results showed that the proposed system has higher efficiency from the studied methods.

In the present study, effects of RB and FRB pre-treatments on the browning (Maillard reaction) and antioxidant capacity of retorted (115 °C for 15 min) shark meats. Browning of the meat was suppressed and promoted by RB and FRB, respectively. DPPH radical scavenging was clearly increased by FRB, and its induction was correlated with the increasing a* value of the retorted meat paste. The Fe-reducing power was decreased with RB pre-treatment and it was correlated with the b* value of retorted meat broth. These results suggest that RB-treatment can prevent undesirable browning, and FRB can induce radical scavenging capacity. These are both thought to be useful for improving the quality of sharks and other meats.

AB  - South African white sharks have disappeared from one of the world's aggregation ‘hot spots’. This has led to speculation that unsustainable fishing of smaller shark species may have displaced white sharks by removing their primary food source. Most of the catch from these fisheries is exported to Australia to supply the domestic ‘fish and chips’ market so a link has been made between the disappearance of South Africa's white sharks and shark consumption in Australia. As cooked seafood is not properly labelled in Australia, consumers cannot readily distinguish between sustainable and non-sustainable seafood. Hence, a highly promoted campaign was recently initiated to encourage Australians to stop eating ‘fish and chips’ and as such save South Africa's white sharks. However, most of the consumed shark in Australia is sourced from sustainable domestic fisheries and encouraging Australian consumers to stop eating ‘fish and chips’ would not help South African white sharks as it would simply displace the issue. It would not address any South African sustainability concerns and would negatively impact a legitimate and sustainable Australian industry. Instead, we encourage the South African government to establish and enforce a governance system for sustainably managing sharks and the Australian government to legislate and enforce the accurate labelling of all types of seafood.

A total of 63 whale sharks (50♂, 13♀) were sampled from the two localities (La Paz Bay n = 32, Yucatan Peninsula n = 31) in Mexico. Isotopic signatures differed greatly between both localities with mean values for δ15N in La Paz Bay (13.5 ± 0.1‰) being considerably higher than the Yucatan Peninsula (8.3 ± 0.1‰). As for δ13C both localities represented similar means (La Paz Bay − 15.4 ± 0.5‰, Yucatan Peninsula − 14.2 ± 0.1‰). A Mann-Whitney U test revealed no significant differences between sexes at localities for δ15N (La Paz Bay, p > .05, Yucatan Peninsula, P > .05) and also for δ13C (La Paz Bay, p > .05, Yucatan Peninsula, P > .05). Between size groups of individuals (<6 m - > 6 m), significant differences were observed in the δ15N for whale sharks solely from La Paz Bay (p < .05), while no differences were found for δ13C at both localities. A significant relationship was observed between animal size and δ15N values, only for La Paz Bay (r2 = 0.27, p ≤.05). Analysis focused on the isotopic niches within each locality, revealed that individuals from La Paz Bay occupied the largest isotopic niche area compared with the Yucatan Peninsula, suggesting that animals from this population are using a different isoscape outside of the Gulf of California compared to a more uniform use of the habitat in the Gulf of Mexico. Ultimately, this study provided the first isotopic assessment of whale sharks at two unique geographical sites, providing key information that reveals differences in the base of the food web can affect the overall isotopic values.
