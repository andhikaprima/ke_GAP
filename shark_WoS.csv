However, the sustainability of the grouper resources has not been managed effectively and environmentally friendly. This study aims to determine the susceptibility level of red and black groupers in the research area based on the productivity and susceptibility analysis. This study was conducted from May to November 2018, in which the data were collected from the grouper's fishermen using hand line with simple random methods as a fishing gear in Wanci and Tomia islands of Wakatobi. Based on the collected data, productivity attribute of red groupers is at 1.8, and the susceptibility level is at 2.08, while the black groupers have 1.7 for the productivity attributes and 2.0 for their susceptibility level. Based on the susceptibility index of both types of fish, it indicates that red groupers are at 1.61, and the black groupers' susceptibility level is at 1.64. This study implies that the susceptibility index of red and black groupers at Wakatobi National Park is moderate which means that the groupers as a matter of fact experience fishing pressure. Therefore, some sustainable efforts to effectively and environmentally friendly manage the fishing activity in the island need to be done in the future. (c) 2020 GJESM.

There is a lack of fisheries-independent data on the demographics of many species, particularly those inhabiting deeper waters. The common sawshark (Pristiophorus cirratus) is a benthic-associated shark endemic to southeastern Australia that has been fished for over 90 years. Despite regular landings, little is known about their lifespan. To assess the age of P. cirratus, we first assessed their vertebral morphology to determine the best method for band pair elucidation. Based on morphology, vertebrae located in the post-branchial region were identified as the largest and least variable for band pair analysis. A total of eight different age-determination methods were then applied to shark vertebrae from this region to test the viability of traditional and nontraditional techniques in elucidating band pairs. Band pairs were indeterminable across all treatments. This research calls for further work into age validation and development of novel techniques to accurately age sawsharks.","[Burke, Patrick J.; Williamson, Jane E.] Macquarie Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Sydney, NSW 2109, Australia; [Raoult, Vincent] Univ Newcastle, Sch Environm & Life Sci, Ourimbah, NSW 2258, Australia; [Natanson, Lisa J.] Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Northeast Fisheries Sci Ctr, NOAA, 28 Tarzwell Dr, Narragansett, RI 02882 USA; [Murphy, Timothy D.] Macquarie Univ, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, Sydney, NSW 2109, Australia; [Peddemors, Victor] Sydney Inst Marine Sci, New South Wales Dept Primary Ind, Fisheries, 19 Chowder Bay Rd, Mosman, NSW 2088, Australia","Burke, PJ (corresponding author), Macquarie Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Sydney, NSW 2109, Australia.",Patrick-john.burke@hdr.mq.edu.au,,"Williamson, Jane/0000-0003-3627-4508; Burke, Patrick/0000-0002-7217-0215",Save Our Seas Foundation Keystone Grant on sawsharks [2019/441],"We would like to acknowledge the efforts of many people who made this research possible including Louise Tosetto, Ryan Nevatte, Jorge Rodriguez, Adrian Gleiss, Mark Bond, members of the Marine Ecology Group at Macquarie University, Margery Pardey from Macquarie Medical Imaging and Dorrit Jacob from the Macquarie University Geoanalytical Lab.

In this study we used in vitro stomach and intestinal gut sacs to investigate the effects of consuming a urea-rich meal (700 mM within a 2% body-mass ration of food-slurry) on nitrogen movement across the gastrointestinal (GI) tract of North Pacific spiny dogfish (Squalus acanthias suckleyi). Plasma urea concentrations did not differ between fasted (359 +/- 19 mM), urea-poor fed (340 +/- 16 mM), and urea-rich fed (332 +/- 24 mM) dogfish. Interestingly, in vitro gut sacs of urea-rich fed dogfish showed no net urea absorption from the lumen over 3 h incubation, which contrasts previously published data on urea-poor fed dogfish that absorb urea from the lumen. In addition, ammonium (NH4+) concentration within the gut sac intestinal lumen significantly increased from 0.62 to 4.35 mM over 3 h. This is likely due to a combination of tissue production and microbial urease activity in the intestine. The overall results highlight the ability of S. a. suckleyi to regulate and maintain internal nitrogen concentrations despite the addition of excess dietary urea.","[Hoogenboom, J.

Mutations in MRAP are associated with familial glucocorticoid deficiency type-2 and evidence is emerging of the importance of MRAP in adrenal development and ACTH signalling. Human MRAP has two functional splice variants: MRAP-alpha and MRAP-beta, unlike MRAP-beta, MRAP-alpha has little expression in brain but is highly expressed in ovary. MRAP2, identified through whole human genome sequence analysis, has approximately 40% sequence homology to MRAP. MRAP2 facilitates MC2 localisation to the cell surface but not ACTH signalling. MRAP and MRAP2 have been found to regulate the surface expression and signalling of all melanocortin receptors (MC1-5). Additionally, MRAP2 moderates the signalling of the G-protein coupled receptors (GCPRs): orexin, prokineticin and GHSR1 alpha; the ghrelin receptor. Whilst MRAP appears to be mainly involved in glucocorticoid synthesis, an important role is emerging for MRAP2 in regulating appetite and energy homeostasis. Transgenic models indicate the importance of MRAP in adrenal gland formation. Like MC3R and MC4R knockout mice, MRAP2 knockout mice have an obese phenotype. In vitro studies indicate that MRAP2 enhances the MC3 and MC4 response to the agonist alpha MSH, which, like ACTH, is produced through precursor polypeptide proopiomelanocortin (POMC) cleavage. Analysis of cohorts of individuals with obesity have revealed several MRAP2 genetic variants with loss of function mutations which are causative of monogenic hyperphagic obesity with hyperglycaemia and hypertension. MRAP2 may also be associated with female infertility. This review summarises current knowledge of MRAP and MRAP2, their influence on GPCR signalling, and focusses on pathophysiology, particularly familial glucocorticoid deficiency type-2 and obesity.","[Berruien, Nasrin N.

The polyphyodont system is considered the ancestral condition of the gnathostome dentition. Despite this shared regenerative ability, sharks and rays exhibit dramatic interspecific variation in their tooth morphology. Ray (batoidea) teeth typically constitute crushing pads of flattened teeth, whereas shark teeth are pointed, multi-cuspid units. Although recent research has addressed the molecular development of the shark dentition, little is known about that of the ray. Furthermore, how dental diversity within the elasmobranch lineage is achieved remains unknown. Here, we examine dental development and regeneration in two Batoid species: the thornback skate (Raja clavata) and the little skate (Leucoraja erinacea). Using in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry, we examine the expression of a core gnathostome dental gene set during early development of the skate dentition and compare it to development in the shark. Elasmobranch tooth development is highly conserved, with sox2 likely playing an important role in the initiation and regeneration of teeth. Alterations to conserved genes expressed in an enamel knot-like signalling centre may explain the morphological diversity of elasmobranch teeth, thereby enabling sharks and rays to occupy diverse dietary and ecological niches.","[Rasch, Liam J.; Cooper, Rory L.] Univ Sheffield, Dept Anim & Plant Sci, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England; [Cooper, Rory L.] Univ Geneva, Dept Genet & Evolut, CH-1205 Geneva, Switzerland; [Underwood, Charlie] Birkbeck Univ London, Dept Earth & Planetary Sci, London WC1E 7HX, England; [Dillard, Wesley A.; Fraser, Gareth J.] Univ Florida, Dept Biol, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Thiery, Alexandre P.] Kings Coll London, Ctr Craniofacial & Regenerat Biol, Fac Dent Craniofacial & Oral Sci, London SE1 9RT, England","Fraser, GJ (corresponding author), Univ Florida, Dept Biol, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.",g.fraser@ufl.edu,,"Dillard, Wesley/0000-0002-0803-0509",Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)NERC Natural Environment Research Council [NE/K014595/1]; NERC Ph.D. studentshipNERC Natural Environment Research Council [NE/K014293/1]; Leverhulme Trust Research GrantLeverhulme Trust [RPG-211]; University of FloridaUniversity of Florida,"This research was supported by the following research grants: Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) standard grant, NE/K014595/1 (to GJF); NERC Ph.D. studentship (LJR); NE/K014293/1 (to CJU); the Leverhulme Trust Research Grant, RPG-211 (to GJF), and the University of Florida.",,65,0,0,1,1,ACADEMIC PRESS INC ELSEVIER SCIENCE,SAN DIEGO,"525 B ST, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA",0012-1606,1095-564X,,DEV BIOL,Dev.

New technologies are being trialled in New South Wales, on Australia's east coast, to accommodate the community demand for increased beach-user protection that does not harm marine wildlife. Drones (or unmanned aerial vehicles), are one of a suite of potential tools that can address both these demands. We released an online survey to assess beach-user perceptions and attitudes toward drones on NSW beaches as a shark surveillance tool. From 439 respondents, we found the use of drones on coastal beaches was accepted by the majority of people surveyed (88%) due to perceptions of reduced impact on sharks, and the relatively low cost. Drone surveillance was also the preferred approach for bather protection overall. Arguably the most vulnerable beach-user group for a shark bite incident, surfers, claimed the highest level of awareness of the use of drones for shark surveillance, but also indicated lower confidence in their utility compared to other groups. The study demonstrates an overall social licence regarding the use of drones for shark surveillance purposes, with the levels of support likely to increase with further public education efforts and improvements to the efficacy of drone-based surveillance.","[Stokes, Debra; Apps, Kirin; Butcher, Paul A.; Luke, Hanabeth; Colefax, Andrew P.] Southern Cross Univ, Sch Environm Sci & Engn, POB 157, Lismore, NSW 2480, Australia; [Butcher, Paul A.] Natl Marine Sci Ctr, NSW Dept Primary Ind, POB 4321, Coffs Harbour, NSW 2450, Australia; [Weiler, Betty] Southern Cross Univ, Sch Business & Tourism, POB 157, Lismore, NSW 2480, Australia","Stokes, D (corresponding author), Southern Cross Univ, Sch Environm Sci & Engn, POB 157, Lismore, NSW 2480, Australia.",Debra.Stokes@scu.edu.au,,,"Southern Cross University; Shark Management Strategy by the New South Wales Department of Primary Industries (NSW DPI), Australia","Southern Cross University provided 'Human Ethics' (ACEC Ref.

Nevertheless, the elasmobranch eye features numerous specialisations that have no doubt facilitated the diversification and evolutionary success of this fascinating taxon. In this review, I highlight recent discoveries on the nature and phylogenetic distribution of visual pigments in sharks and rays. Whereas most rays appear to be cone dichromats, all sharks studied to date are cone monochromats and, as a group, have likely abandoned colour vision on multiple occasions. This situation in sharks mirrors that seen in other large marine predators, the pinnipeds and cetaceans, which leads us to reassess the costs and benefits of multiple cone pigments and wavelength discrimination in the marine environment.","[Hart, Nathan S.] Macquarie Univ, Dept Biol Sci, N Ryde, NSW 2109, Australia","Hart, NS (corresponding author), Macquarie Univ, Dept Biol Sci, N Ryde, NSW 2109, Australia.",nathan.hart@mq.edu.au,"Hart, Nathan/B-8564-2011","Hart, Nathan/0000-0002-7289-9399","Australian Research CouncilAustralian Research Council [DP0558681, LP160100333]","The author would like to thank Prof. Tom Baden for the invitation to contribute to this issue.

Mercury contamination could represent an additional threat to shark populations that are declining worldwide. Here we measured total mercury, carbon and nitrogen isotopes, as well as mercury isotopes, in two co-occurring shark species (the bull shark Carcharhinus leucas and the tiger shark Galeocerdo cuvier) and their potential prey from a coastal ecosystem of the western Indian Ocean (La Reunion Island). Our primary goals were to (i) determine the main trophic Hg sources for sharks and (ii) better characterize their diet composition and foraging habitat. Hg isotope signatures (Delta Hg-199 and delta Hg-202) of shark prey suggested that bull sharks were exposed to methylmercury (MeHg) produced in offshore epipelagic waters, while tiger sharks were exposed to offshore mesopelagic MeHg with additional microbial transformation in slope sediments. Delta Hg-199 values efficiently traced the ecology of the two predators, demonstrating that bull sharks targeted coastal prey in shallow waters while tiger sharks were mainly foraging on mesopelagic species in the deeper waters of the island slope. Unexpectedly, we found a positive shift in delta Hg-202 (>1 parts per thousand) between sharks and their prey, leading to high delta Hg-202 values in the two shark species (e.g. 1.91 +/- 0.52 parts per thousand in bull sharks). This large shift in delta Hg-202 indicates that sharks may display strong MeHg demethylation abilities, possibly reflecting evolutionary pathways for mitigating their MeHg contamination.

This has led to speculation that unsustainable fishing of smaller shark species may have displaced white sharks by removing their primary food source. Most of the catch from these fisheries is exported to Australia to supply the domestic 'fish and chips' market so a link has been made between the disappearance of South Africa's white sharks and shark consumption in Australia. As cooked seafood is not properly labelled in Australia, consumers cannot readily distinguish between sustainable and non-sustainable seafood. Hence, a highly promoted campaign was recently initiated to encourage Australians to stop eating 'fish and chips' and as such save South Africa's white sharks. However, most of the consumed shark in Australia is sourced from sustainable domestic fisheries and encouraging Australian consumers to stop eating 'fish and chips' would not help South African white sharks as it would simply displace the issue. It would not address any South African sustainability concerns and would negatively impact a legitimate and sustainable Australian industry. Instead, we encourage the South African government to establish and enforce a governance system for sustainably managing sharks and the Australian government to legislate and enforce the accurate labelling of all types of seafood.","[Braccini, Matias; Blay, Nick; Harry, Alastair; Newman, Stephen J.] Govt Western Australia, Western Australian Fisheries & Marine Res Labs, Dept Primary Ind & Reg Dev, POB 20, North Beach, WA 6920, Australia","Newman, SJ (corresponding author), Govt Western Australia, Western Australian Fisheries & Marine Res Labs, Dept Primary Ind & Reg Dev, POB 20, North Beach, WA 6920, Australia.",Stephen.Newman@dpird.wa.gov.au,,,"Department of Primary Industries and Regional Development, Government of Western Australia","This work was funded by the Department of Primary Industries and Regional Development, Government of Western Australia.",,13,0,0,3,3,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-597X,1872-9460,,MAR POLICY,Mar.

Concern has been raised after the 2017 and 2019 shortfin mako evaluations for the Northern Atlantic stock. It stated the population being overfished and suffering from overfishing. Also blue shark is subject to high extraction rates in the Atlantic Ocean. Few data and uncertainty in assessment results suggest that further management strategies could be taken into account for both species. This study evaluated different fisheries management strategies for shortfin mako and blue shark in the Atlantic Ocean from the stakeholders' perspective. Personal interviews were conducted with Spanish fishermen and surveys were sent to scientists and non-governmental organizations (NGOs). Local Ecological Knowledge was considered to be useful as fishermen possess unique expertise based on their continued interaction with the species and environment. Interviews allowed understanding the fishermen's perception on variations of stock abundance, distribution patterns, size of capture and seasonal fluctuations for both species. SWOT (Strength, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats)-analysis was used to study the different management measures. Main management strategies proposed by all stakeholders to reduce the bycatch of both species were spatial-temporal closure, minimum size and quotas. The Sole Bank was suggested as a temporarily closed area to protect blue shark juveniles during the summer months. The participation of stakeholders enriched the knowledge available and provided a broader data set now available for decision makers in the corresponding regional fisheries management organization (RFMOs).","[Dinkel, T.

However, not every CBT operator has an environmental education component attached to its programme. In reality, CBT has the potential to negatively impact the animals it is targeting; thus management is required to mitigate any harmful effects from tourism activities. This paper analyses the attitudes and perceptions of the marine operators and tourists that partake in dolphin-swim activities in the Ponta do Ouro Partial Marine Reserve (PPMR) in Mozambique. Hand-out questionnaire surveys with closed and Likert scale type questions revealed that the tours are an effective means to promote pro-environmental behaviour and consequently increase compliance with the code of conduct. Nonetheless, in the PPMR, both tourists and operators presented only basic knowledge of the regulations of the reserve and of the dolphin, whale and whale shark code of conduct, indicating that there is a need for improvement. We provide recommendations for improving local management, which are also applicable at the national and international level.

With the decline of these animals raising concerns amongst scientists all over the world, we set out to provide an updated assessment on elasmobranch landings in Portugal between 1986 and 2017. The dataset analysed in this study consisted of 15,521 records, each with information concerning the species (or higher taxonomic level), port, month, year, and weight of fish landed. A non-parametric change points assessment statistical technique was used to evaluate important changes in landings throughout the time series. Principal components analysis was also performed to mean values of landings per year for the most captured species, and similar analysis was conducted using fishing ports instead of year, for the same sub-set of species / taxa. According to the data, more than 143 thousand metric tons of elasmobranchs were landed in Portuguese ports between 1986 and 2017, divided by 58 taxa of sharks, skates and rays. The most landed taxa were demersal rays and skates (Raja spp.), followed by spotted dogfishes (Scyliorhinus spp.), blue shark (Prionace glauca), Portuguese dogfish (Centroscymnus coelolepis), leafscale gulper shark (Centrophorus squamosus), gulper shark (Centrophorus granulosus) and shortfin mako (Isurus oxyrinchus). Together, these seven taxa accounted for more than 75% of all landings. Several cases of misreporting were identified and discussed. Overall, landings of elasmobranchs in Portugal show marked decreases and changes in composition, with deep-sea sharks being the most influential group during the studied period.","[Alves, Luis M.

We present size-frequency distributions with size at first maturity for Urobatis halleri, Urotrygon chilensis, Rhinoptera steindachneri, Hypanus dipterurus, Gymnura marmorata, and Pseudobatos glaucostigmus, which were the species most frequently present in the prawn trawls during the surveys. These distributions are presented by zone, depth stratum, and season (mainly summer, when commercial prawn trawling is prohibited, and thus information from commercial catches is not available). We found significant differences in the mean size between mature females and mature males for five of these six species. We also found that fish escape devices installed in the prawn nets early in 2016 improved the escape of mid-sized rays, demonstrating size selectivity of the fishery and suggesting the potential to improve further the escape of large-sized rays by modifying fish escape devices. Furthermore, the large number of rays caught (21 species) compared with the number of sharks caught (four species) suggests much lower catchabilities for sharks than for rays in demersal prawn trawl gear.","[Garces-Garcia, Karla C.; Walker, Terence, I; Day, Robert W.] Univ Melbourne, Sch Biosci, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia; [Garces-Garcia, Karla C.] Univ Veracruzana, Fac Biol & Agr Sci, Tuxpan 92850, Veracruz, Mexico; [Tovar-Avila, Javier] INAPESCA, CRIAP Bahia de Banderas, Tortuga 1, Bahia De Banderas 63732, Nayarit, Mexico; [Vargas-Trejo, Bibiana] Natl Technol Inst Mexico, Campus Bahia de Banderas,Carretera Punta de Mita, Bahia De Banderas 63734, Nayarit, Mexico; [Chavez-Arrenquin, Dario A.] INAPESCA, CRIAP Mazatlan, Calzada Sabalo Cerritos S-N, Mazatlan 82112, Sinaloa, Mexico","Garces-Garcia, KC (corresponding author), Univ Melbourne, Sch Biosci, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia.; Garces-Garcia, KC (corresponding author), Univ Veracruzana, Fac Biol & Agr Sci, Tuxpan 92850, Veracruz, Mexico.",kgarces@uv.mx,,,National Council of Science and Technology (CONACyT) MexicoConsejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT) [410737],"Thanks to the National Council of Science and Technology (CONACyT) Mexico for the scholarship number 410737 and to The University of Veracruz, campus Poza Rica-Tuxpan, Veracruz, Mexico for permission to undertake this investigation as part of the Ph.D. project for Karla C.

These models are commonly fit using Bayesian methods, with the prior for the intrinsic rate of growth (r) set based on the results of a demographic analysis. We used simulations based on blue shark Prionace glauca in the Indian Ocean to evaluate the performances of estimation methods that reflect different assumptions regarding the form of the production function and the basis for the prior for r. Nine age-structured operating models reflected different levels of productivity (determined by the steepness of stock-recruitment relationship [h = 0.4; h = 0.6; h = 0.79] and the pattern of historical catches (increasing, stable and declining). As expected, estimation performance was poorer for greater extents of observation error, and better when there was more 'contrast' in biomass. However, the PTPM usually performed worse than the LPM, particularly for high levels of observation error. Surprisingly, the prior for r with mean set to of the estimate of the r inferred from the demographic analysis combined with the LPM performed best for an increasing catch series (a one-way trip in biomass) and high uncertainty in the abundance index. Additional analyses revealed that the poor performance of the PTPM was due to the additional estimation variance associated with the estimation of the shape parameter, while the better performance for the 'wrong prior' occurred because the Schaefer model assumes a linear relationship between growth rate and population depletion whereas an age-structured model implies a non-linear relationship. Given poor data, r is not updated much, leading the LPM to overestimate productivity. This paper highlights the dangers of naively integrating demographic analysis into Bayesian surplus production models, and the value of including simulation analysis as a part of the standard set of diagnostics used when selecting an estimation method on which to base stock assessments. We also recommend use of JABBA-Select or a prior for r from a demographic analysis that accounts for the status of the population when the data on which the demographic parameters are based as well as the form of the production function.","[Geng, Zhe; Wang, Yang; Zhu, Jiangfeng; Dai, Xiaojie] Shanghai Ocean Univ, Coll Marine Sci, 999 Hucheng Huan Rd, Shanghai 201306, Peoples R China; [Geng, Zhe; Wang, Yang; Zhu, Jiangfeng; Dai, Xiaojie] Shanghai Ocean Univ, Key Lab Sustainable Exploitat Ocean Fisheries Res, Minist Educ, Shanghai 201306, Peoples R China; [Punt, Andre E.] Univ Washington, Sch Aquat & Fishery Sci, Seattle, WA 98105 USA","Zhu, JF (corresponding author), Shanghai Ocean Univ, Coll Marine Sci, 999 Hucheng Huan Rd, Shanghai 201306, Peoples R China.",jfzhu@shou.edu.cn,,"Punt, Andre/0000-0001-8489-2488",Shanghai Ocean University; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [41676120]; China Scholarship CouncilChina Scholarship Council,This work was conducted using data from the IOTC Working Party on Ecosystems and Bycatch (WPEB).

Few fisheries-independent, extended time-series data exist for coastal shark species in the northwest Atlantic Ocean or Caribbean outside of the United States. A decades old dataset comprised of standardized longline surveys provided us with the opportunity to characterize diversity and evaluate changes in the relative abundance of sharks in the eastern Bahamas between 1979-1990 and 2011-2013. Caribbean reef sharks Carcharhinus perezi and tiger sharks Galeocerdo cuvier were the two most commonly captured species throughout the survey and were the only two species analyzed in detail. For both species, sex ratios favored females. Using Bayesian generalized linear models, we found that Caribbean reef shark catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) exhibited a positive relationship with year and temperature, while size exhibited no relationship with year and a negative relationship with temperature. There was no relationship between tiger shark CPUE and year but there was a positive relationship between size and year. These results are presented in the context of Bahamian shark conservation efforts and the results of other surveys in the region.","[Talwar, Brendan S.; Brooks, Edward J.] Cape Eleuthera Inst, Shark Res & Conservat Program, POB EL 26029, Rock Sound, Eleuthera, Bahamas; [Talwar, Brendan S.] Florida Int Univ, Dept Biol Sci, 3000 NE 151st St, North Miami, FL 33181 USA; [Stein, Jeffrey A.] Univ Illinois, Illinois Nat Hist Survey, 1816 S Oak St, Champaign, IL 61820 USA; [Connett, Stephen M.

It belongs to Lower Tf1 Letter Stage (based on larger benthic foraminifers) of the Burdigalian, within interval 19-16 Ma, and is the only Miocene unit on the platform. The Trealla Limestone here is coeval to the deeper water lower part of the much thicker Trealla Limestone in the Exmouth Sub-basin to the northwest. A seagrass-meadow depositional environment is indicated by most of the studied microfacies based on comparisons with modern sediment composition and foraminiferal assemblages found in innermost shelf seagrass banks between 23 degrees S and 32 degrees S on the present Western Australian coast. Some levels in the Trealla Limestone on the platform (e.g. with abundant miliolid foraminifers, and absence of coral debris) probably were deposited in and around dense seagrass meadows similar to those present today in the metahaline (40-55 ppt salinity) reaches of Shark Bay; whereas other levels (e.g. coral floatstone) were deposited under normal-marine conditions. Based on comparisons with modern carbonate sediment and biota in the region, the biogenic composition of the Trealla Limestone on the platform suggests winter minimum sea-surface temperatures within the range of 17-22 degrees C. The Nullabor Limestone in the Eucla Basin, at 10 degrees further south on the southern Australian margin, is similar, at least in part, in composition and age to the Trealla Limestone on the Southern Carnarvon Platform. Both may have been deposited during a Burdigalian sea-level rise, and during part of the Miocene climate optimum recognized elsewhere. Sediment composition and foraminiferal assemblages (including epiphytic types) found in the Trealla and Nullabor limestones are similar to those in the modern seagrass banks of the region. This suggests that seagrasses similar to the extensive Posidonia and Amphibolus stands, which are dominant today between 25 degrees S and 35 degrees S along the Western Australian coast, were widespread during the Burdigalian.","[Haig, David W.] Univ Western Australia, Oceans Grad Sch, 35 Stirling Highway, Perth, WA 6009, Australia; [Smith, Margaret G.; Riera, Rosine; Parker, Justin H.] Univ Western Australia, Sch Earth Sci, 35 Stirling Highway, Perth, WA 6009, Australia","Haig, DW (corresponding author), Univ Western Australia, Oceans Grad Sch, 35 Stirling Highway, Perth, WA 6009, Australia.",david.haig@uwa.edu.au; msmi7118@bigpond.net.au; rosine.riera@gmail.com; Justin.Parker@taskfronterra.com,,,Oceans Graduate School at the University of Western Australia; School of Earth Sciences at the University of Western Australia,"We thank the Oceans Graduate School and the School of Earth Sciences at the University of Western Australia for facilitating this self-funded study.

Embryo muscle tissue had significantly higher concentrations of most trace elements when compared to mothers, with the exception of Hg. Embryo liver accumulated more nonessential elements than muscle (n = 7 vs. 0, respectively), while the Se:Hg molar ratio was >1 in liver and muscle of both mothers and embryos. Livers of embryos were moderately enriched in delta C-13 and delta N-15 when compared to that of their mother. Negative correlations were observed between embryo body length and delta C-13 and trace elements concentrations. We conclude that mothers offload a large portion of all essential elements and Al, As and Pb to their young and that the isotopic fractionation of embryos reflects maternal diet and habitat occupied, with delta C-13 diluted with embryonic growth. We also show that muscle and liver accumulate trace elements at different rates relative to the body length of embryos. The Se:Hg molar ratio suggests that Se could play a protective role against Hg toxicity during early stages of M. higmani embryonic development. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Progressive increases in testis width, epididymis head width, plasma testosterone (T) concentrations, and occurrence of mature spermatozoa were observed in maleS. tiburofrom June to September, demonstrating that spermatogenesis occurs during the summer. Nonetheless, increases in maximum follicle diameter, oviducal gland width, plasma 17 beta-estradiol and T concentrations, and occurrence of vitellogenic follicles were not observed in mature females until between October and April, demonstrating non-synchronous patterns of gametogenesis in males and females. Fresh copulatory wounds were observed in females collected during late September along with histological evidence for sperm presence in the oviducal gland between September and April, confirming a 6- to 7 month period of female sperm storage. Ovulation occurred between mid-April and early May in concert with increases in female plasma progesterone concentrations. Gestation occurred during a 4.5- to 5 month period between May and early September, and 97% of mature females collected during this period were gravid, indicating a highly synchronized, annual reproductive periodicity. Brood size was significantly correlated with maternal size and ranged from 1 to 13 pups with a mean +/- S.D.of 8.1 +/- 2.2, which was significantly lower than reported in Gulf of Mexico (GOM) populations. The occurrence of non-fertile offspring was observed in 17% of broods with a range of 1-7 non-fertile eggs present in individual females. Thus, as previously reported in GOMS. tiburo, this unusual form of infertility also appears to be prevalent in the NWA population and requires further study. This study has demonstrated meaningful differences in reproductive biology of these populations, emphasizing the need for region-specific approaches for population management.","[De Acevedo, Melissa Gonzalez; Gelsleichter, James] Univ North Florida, 1 UNF Dr, Jacksonville, FL 32224 USA; [Frazier, Bryan S.] South Carolina Dept Nat Resources, Charleston, SC USA; [Belcher, Carolyn] Georgia Dept Nat Resources, Coastal Resources Div, Brunswick, GA USA","Gelsleichter, J (corresponding author), Univ North Florida, 1 UNF Dr, Jacksonville, FL 32224 USA.",jim.gelsleichter@unf.edu,,,"National Marine Fisheries Service, National Oceanic and Atmospheric AdministrationNational Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA [NA12NMF4540080]; Cooperative Atlantic States Shark Pupping and Nursery Habitat Survey (COASTSPAN); Southeast Area Monitoring and Assessment Program (SEAMAP); National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS)","National Marine Fisheries Service, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Grant/Award Number: NA12NMF4540080; The Cooperative Atlantic States Shark Pupping and Nursery Habitat Survey (COASTSPAN), the Southeast Area Monitoring and Assessment Program (SEAMAP) and National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS)",,63,0,0,0,0,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-1112,1095-8649,,J FISH BIOL,J.

Sizes ranged from 80 to 298 cm fork length (FL) for blue sharks and from 48 to 99 cm FL for crocodile sharks. Sexual segregation was observed during different months for both sharks. The sex ratio for blue sharks was 1.38 F:1 M, and 1 F:2.79 M for crocodile sharks. The size of adult blue sharks ranged from 144 to 280 cm for males and from 174 to 298 cm for females; and that of crocodile sharks from 63 to 97 cm for males and 78-99 cm for females. The size at 50% of maturity for blue sharks was estimated at 191.7 cm FL for females and 197.5 cm FL for males, and that of crocodile sharks was assessed at 84.9 cm FL for females and 78.5 cm FL for males. Most sexually matured females were pregnant; their means were 207.2 +/- 16.4 cm FL for blue sharks and 89.4 +/- 4.3 cm FL for crocodile sharks. Mature sizes for both species were significantly different among months. Embryonic sizes also varied widely among months for crocodile sharks, but a slight change was recorded for those of blue sharks. The observed mean size at birth and litter size were 34.5 cm FL and 37 +/- 12 for the blue sharks, and that of the crocodile sharks, 39.5 cm FL and a dominant four embryos in the uterus.

We investigated the movements and growth rates of the broadnose sevengill sharkNotorynchus cepedianusin southern Africa, using data from the Oceanographic Research Institute's Cooperative Fish Tagging Project (ORI-CFTP). A total of 3 513N. cepedianuswere tagged between 1984 and 2017, with 195 (5.6%) recaptured. Distribution ranged from Cape Fria, northern Namibia, to the Great Kei River, Eastern Cape, South Africa, representing a range extension of similar to 200 km in comparison with that previously reported. Most captures occurred along the west coast of South Africa, and recaptures showed connectivity between the west and south coasts, but not between South Africa and Namibia. Site fidelity was evident, with the majority of recaptures (66.6%,n= 130) occurring <50 km from the release site, and many recaptures (32.8%,n= 64) occurring <1 km from the release site. Few sharks (22.6%,n= 44) were recaptured >100 km from the release site, while only three sharks (1.5%) were recaptured >500 km from the release site. Growth rates forN. cepedianusat reference precaudal lengths of 100 cm and 160 cm were estimated to be 4.7 cm y(-1)and 4.0 cm y(-1), respectively, which are lower than previous growth estimates. The slow growth rate and site fidelity evident inN. cepedianus, coupled with being captured in several commercial fisheries, necessitate the need for improved management of this species.","[Engelbrecht, T.

Tracing fins from internationally regulated species to their starting point in the supply chain can have important implications for the monitoring and enforcement of international laws intended to protect threatened shark species. Here we use pelagic thresher sharkAlopias pelagicusfin samples (N = 86) collected during a 4-year period (2014-2017), and phylogenetic analyses, using the cytochrome oxidase I (COI), to determine the relative contribution of this species to the two largest shark fin trade hubs in the world, Hong Kong and Guangzhou, mainland China. Our results suggest that the Eastern Pacific is a major starting point of the international supply chain of pelagic thresher shark fins, contributing 84.9% of the analyzed market-derived fin samples. We suggest that capacity building investments are needed in Eastern Pacific countries to increase the efficiency of border control inspections and improve the enforcement of international trade regulations for this threatened shark species. Our study highlights the utility of combining population genetics data and large-scale market surveys to trace wildlife products back to the starting point in the supply chain and support the assessment of emerging management and conservation measures for exploited sharks.","[Cardenosa, D.; Fields, A.

Sequential minimal optimization (SMO) is considered as an effective solution to this challenging task, and the working set selection is one of the key steps in SMO. Various strategies have been developed and implemented for working set selection in LibSVM and Shark. In this work we point out that the algorithm used in LibSVM does not maintain the box-constraints which, nevertheless, are very important for evaluating the final gain of the selection operation. Here, we propose a new algorithm to address this challenge. The proposed algorithm maintains the box-constraints within a selection procedure using a feasible optional step-size. We systematically study and compare several related algorithms, and derive new theoretical results. Experiments on benchmark data sets show that our algorithm effectively improves the training speed without loss of accuracy. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Differences in whole body shape, swimming style, and physiological parameters have previously been linked to varied habitat uses. Pectoral fin morphology has been used to taxonomically classify species and hypotheses on the functional differences in shape are noted throughout the literature; however, there are limited comparative datasets that quantify external and skeletal morphology. Further, fins were previously categorized into two discrete groups based on the amount of skeletal support present: (a) aplesodic, where less than half of the fin is supported and (b) plesodic where greater than half of the fin is supported. These discrete classifications have been used to phylogenetically place species, though the methodology of classification is infrequently described. In this study, we sampled fins from 18 species, 6 families, and 3 orders, which were also grouped into five ecomorphotype classifications. We examined the external morphology, extent of skeletal support, and cross-sectional shape of individual cartilaginous elements. Using phylogenetic comparative methods, we show that fin shape does not differ significantly between ecomorphotypes, suggesting there may be some mechanical constraint. However, we find that the internal anatomy of the fin does vary significantly between ecomorphotypes, especially the extent and distribution of calcification of skeletal support, suggesting that the superficial similarity of fin shapes across ecomorphotypes may belie differences in function. Finally, we find that a number of morphological variables such as number of radials, radial calcification and shape, and fin taper all correlate with the extent of skeletal support. Within these morphospaces, we also describe that some orders/families tend to occupy certain areas with limited overlap. While we demonstrate that there is some mechanical constraint limiting external variations in shark pectoral fin morphology, there are compounding differences in skeletal anatomy that occur within ecomorphotypes which we propose may affect function.","[Hoffmann, Sarah L.] Biomark Inc, Appl Biol Serv, Boise, ID 83702 USA; [Buser, Thaddaeus J.] Oregon State Univ, Dept Fisheries & Wildlife, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Porter, Marianne E.] Florida Atlantic Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Boca Raton, FL 33431 USA","Hoffmann, SL (corresponding author), Biomark Inc, Appl Biol Serv, Boise, ID 83702 USA.",slhoffmann2014@gmail.com,,"Porter, Marianne/0000-0002-3622-7114",Florida Atlantic University; Florida Atlantic University Newell Doctoral Fellowship; Delores.

The teeth of the Bolca specimens differ from the type speciesA. arambourgiin some characters (i.e., labial face with concave profile just below the crest, convex lower down; lingual face slightly more developed than the labial, with convex profile in its upper part and a concave profile in its mid-lower region) that justify the recognition of a second species within the genus, i.e.,A. crassicaudata. This taxon also shows a unique combination of features (e.g., pectoral disc large and rhomboid; tail short, 44-52% of total length; ca. 238 vertebral centra; distal segment of propterygia located between mouth and antorbital cartilage; mesopterygium single, not fused to radials; 100-117 pectoral radials; 15-17 pelvic-fin radials; elongated caudal fin of aplesodic type) that supports its sister-group relationship with the living urolophidsUrolophusandTrygonoptera.Arechiawas a typical inhabitant of the near coastal and warm habitats that characterize the Monte Postale paleoenvironment.","[Marrama, Giuseppe; Carnevale, Giorgio] Univ Torino, Dipartimento Sci Terra, Via Valperga Caluso 35, I-10125 Turin, Italy; [Naylor, Gavin J.

Wetland hydroperiod increased by 87 days, following restoration actions and rainfall events that increased median stage in the upstream source canal. Concentrations of TP were highest and most variable at sites closest (<1 km) to canal inputs and upstream wetland sources of legacy P. Surface water TOC:TP and TN:TP ratios were highest in wetlands >1 km downstream of the canal in wet season 2015 with spatial variability reflecting disturbances including droughts, fires, and freeze events. The TP concentrations of flocculent soil surface particles, periphyton, sawgrass, and consolidated soil declined, and TC:TP and TN:TP ratios increased (except soil) logarithmically with downstream distance from the canal. We measured abrupt increases in periphyton (wet season 2018) and sawgrass TP (wet season 2015 and 2018) at sites <1 km from the canal, likely reflecting legacy TP loading. Our results suggest restoration efforts that increase freshwater inflow and hydroperiod will likely change patterns of nutrient concentrations among water and organic matter compartments of wetlands as a function of nutrient legacies.","[Sarker, Shishir K.; Kominoski, John S.; Gaiser, Evelyn E.] Florida Int Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Inst Environm, Miami, FL 33199 USA; [Sarker, Shishir K.; Scinto, Leonard J.] Florida Int Univ, Inst Environm, Dept Earth & Environm, Miami, FL 33199 USA; [Rudnick, David T.] South Florida Nat Resources Ctr, Everglades Natl Pk, Homestead, FL 33030 USA","Kominoski, JS (corresponding author), Florida Int Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Inst Environm, Miami, FL 33199 USA.",jkominos@fiu.edu,,"Kominoski, John/0000-0002-0978-3326","Florida International University [CA H5297-05-0099, P11A50510, P14AC01639, P16AC00032, P16AC01704]; Everglades National Park [CA H5297-05-0099, P11A50510, P14AC01639, P16AC00032, P16AC01704]; Florida Coastal Everglades Long-Term Ecological Research programunder National Science Foundation [DEB-9910514, DBI-0620409, DEB-1237517, DEB-1832229]","This research was supported by multiple cooperative and task agreements between Florida International University and Everglades National Park (CA H5297-05-0099, P11A50510, P14AC01639, P16AC00032, P16AC01704).

Among these conflicts, large marine predators feeding on fisheries catches, a behaviour termed depredation, has emerged concomitantly with the expansion of the world's fisheries. Depredation poses threats to both the socio-economic viability of fisheries and species conservation, stressing the need for mitigation. This review synthesizes the extent and socio-ecological impacts of depredation by sharks and marine mammals across the world, and the various approaches used to minimize it. Depredation was reported in 214 fisheries between 1979 and 2019 (70% post-2000) and affected fleets from 44 countries, in all sectors (commercial, artisanal and recreational), and in all major fishing techniques (nets, traps and hook-and-lines). A total of 68 predator species were involved in depredation (20 odontocetes, 21 pinnipeds and 27 sharks), and most (73%) were subject to either by-catch and/or retaliatory killing from fishers when interacting with gear. Impacts on fishers were primarily associated with catch losses and gear damage but often lacked assessments. Deterrence was a major mitigation approach but also the least effective. Gear modifications or behavioural adaptation by fishers were more promising. This review highlights the need for improved monitoring, and interdisciplinary and integrated research to quantify the determinants and impacts of depredation in the socio-ecological dimension. More importantly, as the conflict is likely to escalate, efforts directed towards changing perceptions and integrating knowledge through adaptive co-management are raised as key directions towards coexistence between fisheries and large marine predators.","[Tixier, Paul; Arnould, John P.

Transmitter-tagged sharks were monitored from November 2012 to July 2019. Residency comparisons were based on the percentage of days that an individual was present in the study area for each month. Sandbar Sharks had greater residencies in fall than spring and winter, Bull Sharks had greater residencies in summer, and Nurse Sharks had greater residencies in the fall. No seasonal patterns were detected for Atlantic Sharpnose Sharks, but one individual returned to the study area in all 5 years that the transmitter was active. One Sandbar Shark and one Nurse Shark had long-term preferences (>3 years) for specific sites. Long-distance migrations (n = 7) away from the artificial reef area in the northern Gulf of Mexico were observed for three Sandbar Sharks (588, 589, and 1,894 km), two Bull Sharks (927 and 968 km), and two Nurse Sharks (903 and 943 km), with six of these migrating sharks returning to their tagging areas. Specifically, two Bull Sharks and two Nurse Sharks made winter migrations to the southern end of Florida (Florida Keys), and two Sandbar Sharks migrated to the middle of the west coast of Florida. A third Sandbar Shark made the longest distance migration and moved out of the Gulf of Mexico, into the Atlantic Ocean, and up to the South Carolina coast. Importantly, this Sandbar Shark returned to the same artificial reef where it was tagged and released in the northern Gulf of Mexico after its 3,788-km round trip migration. These long-distance migrations and subsequent homing behaviors, coupled with local residencies, indicate that the artificial reefs in the northern Gulf of Mexico may have significance extending well beyond the localized areas of reef deployment.","[Altobelli, Ashley N.; Szedlmayer, Stephen T.] Auburn Univ, Sch Fisheries Aquaculture & Aquat Sci, 8300 State Highway 104, Fairhope, AL 36532 USA","Szedlmayer, ST (corresponding author), Auburn Univ, Sch Fisheries Aquaculture & Aquat Sci, 8300 State Highway 104, Fairhope, AL 36532 USA.",szedlst@auburn.edu,,,Marine Resources Division of the Alabama Department of Conservation and Natural Resources; Sportfish Restoration Fund,"We thank R.

We aimed to determine if San Andres, Providencia and Santa Catalina Archipelago could be considered as a hotspot of elasmobranch diversity within the Greater Caribbean. For that, we updated the elasmobranch species richness and analyze its distribution pattern, evaluated the assembly structure and composition and estimated the occurrence probability of the more abundant species of the Archipelago. A total of 46 species, 33 of sharks and 13 of batoids were recorded, with 8 categorized as threatened by IUCN. Quadrants of San Andres and Providencia islands presented the highest richness with 16 species. Oceanic environments differed significantly in composition and abundance from the other four large areas evaluated. Northern banks were the most favorable environments for large-sized pelagic sharks while San Andres and Providencia Islands were for batoids; this difference could be due to the pelagic and benthic habits, respectively, and their relation with availability of substrate, food and sheltered areas. Our study confirmed that the Archipelago has at least 21% of the total richness of the northwestern Atlantic region, 43% of that of the Greater Caribbean and 49% of that registered in the Colombian Caribbean Coast, suggesting that the Archipelago is a potential richness hotspot in the Caribbean region. This high elasmobranch diversity could be due, among others, to its status as a Biosphere Reserve, to its high diversity of habitats and more recently to the establishment of the shark fishing ban.","[Mejia-Falla, Paola A.; Navia, Andres F.] Fdn Colombiana Invest & Conservac Tiburones & Ray, Cali, Colombia; [Mejia-Falla, Paola A.] Wildlife Conservat Soc, Cali, Colombia; [Castro, Erick; Bolanos, Nacor] Corp Reg Desarrollo Sostenible Archipielago San A, San Andres Isla, Colombia; [Caldas, Juan P.] Conservac Int Colombia, Bogota, Colombia; [Ballesteros, Carlos] Minist Relac Exteriores, Bogota, Colombia; [Bent-Hooker, Heins] Minist Ambiente & Desarrollo Sostenible, Direcc Asuntos Marinos Costeros & Recursos Acuat, Bogota, Colombia; [Rojas, Anthony] Secretaria Agr & Pesca, Gobernac Dept Archipielago San Andres Providencia, San Andres Isla, Colombia","Navia, AF (corresponding author), Fdn Colombiana Invest & Conservac Tiburones & Ray, Cali, Colombia.",anavia@squalus.org,,"Navia, Andres Felipe/0000-0002-6758-7729",,,,71,0,0,0,0,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0378-1909,1573-5133,,ENVIRON BIOL FISH,Environ.

A baseline study conducted in 2011-2012 revealed that at least two species of sawfish were still present in Bangladeshi waters and highlighted several important steps that could be taken to prevent populations from further decline. Regular visits to landing sites in the south-eastern coastal region of Bangladesh were conducted to collect data on sawfish landings. A telephone reporting system was developed amongst shark traders and fishers, to facilitate immediate reporting of sawfish landings. Between 15 October 2016 and 26 December 2017, landings of 25 sawfishes were documented, of which at least 17 were largetooth sawfishPristis pristis. No evidence of narrow sawfishAnoxypristis cuspidatawas observed, which may suggest that this species has become rare. These data were collected 5 years after the baseline study was conducted and after several years of broader efforts to highlight the precarious status of sawfish populations globally. The findings illustrate that largetooth sawfish continue to be landed and that none of the management or community engagement activities previously recommended, in order to reduce catch rates, have been implemented. This is an example of the research-practitioner divide, where published scientific research on a group of highly endangered elasmobranchs has not led to their protection. A strategy for communicating the findings of this study and the critical need for local conservation action for sawfishes to key national and local stakeholders is presented, alongside a suite of actions that can be feasibly implemented in the next 12 months.","[Haque, Alifa Bintha; Biswas, Aparna Riti] Univ Dhaka, Dept Zool, Dhaka 1000, Bangladesh; [Haque, Alifa Bintha] Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, Oxford, England; [Leeney, Ruth H.] Protect Africas Sawfishes, Inhambane, Mozambique","Haque, AB (corresponding author), Univ Dhaka, Dept Zool, Dhaka 1000, Bangladesh.",alifa.haque@du.ac.bd,,"Haque, Alifa Bintha/0000-0001-8250-0030",,,,48,0,0,0,0,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1052-7613,1099-0755,,AQUAT CONSERV,Aquat.

Their unusual characteristics should attract attention; however, very few studies have been dedicated to sawsharks. As a result, our understanding of their biology and ecology is limited. However, information on aspects of their biology and ecology can be found in studies not directly focussing on sawsharks. This review provides a synthesis of information pertaining to the 10 recognized sawshark species following a comprehensive search of the scientific literature. We cover their distributions, habitat utilization, life histories, reproduction, trophic dynamics and sensory biology. Current knowledge on their unique rostral structures, the evolutionary history of pristiophorids, taxonomy, behaviour and threats to sawshark populations are also reviewed.

One of the three Sphyrnidae species, the scalloped hammerhead (Sphyrna lewini) are the most common, but their biology and mode of reproduction are not extensively studied in terms of their reproductive biology. The aim of this study was to describe the germ cell development in the testes of sexually mature male scalloped hammerheads. Three individual maleS. lewiniwere caught at Zinkwazi, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. The sharks and their reproductive organs were weighed and measured to collect the biometric data for the condition factor and the gonado-somatic index. Following standard necropsy, the testes were fixed in Bouin's solution and processed for histological assessment. The histological assessment revealed that the testes ofS. lewiniconsist of seminiferous tubules which form part of a larger lobular structure with germ cells in different stages of development, from spermatogonia to mature spermatozoa. Seven stages of development were identified during the process of spermatogenesis, similar to what has been described for elasmobranchs. In conclusion, this study provides evidence that the testes ofS. lewiniare diametrical and polyspermatocystic and conforms to the testes structure of elasmobranch males.","[Coetzee, Helene J.; Wagenaar, Ina] Univ Johannesburg, Dept Zool, POB 524, ZA-2006 Johannesburg, South Africa; [Naidoo, Kristina] KwaZulu Natal Sharks Board, Res andMonitoring Div, Private Bag 2,Umhlanga Rocks, ZA-4320 Durban, South Africa","Wagenaar, I (corresponding author), Univ Johannesburg, Dept Zool, POB 524, ZA-2006 Johannesburg, South Africa.",inaw@uj.ac.za,"Wagenaar, Ina/S-8256-2019","Wagenaar, Ina/0000-0001-5852-1907",KwaZulu-Natal Sharks Board; National Research Foundation of South AfricaNational Research Foundation - South Africa [119318]; Global Excellence Scholarship,"The authors received financial and logistic support from these following institutions: (i) Dr. Geremy Cliff, KwaZulu-Natal Sharks Board, (ii) the National Research Foundation of South Africa for the Incentive Funding for Rated Researchers, Unique Grant No. 119318 and (iii) Global Excellence Scholarship for the 4th Industrial Revolution Grant awarded to Helene J Coetzee for this PhD study.",,39,0,0,0,0,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0920-1742,1573-5168,,FISH PHYSIOL BIOCHEM,Fish Physiol.

Cyclostomes, or modern jawless vertebrates, possess a rudimentary and superficial HBM lateral to the pharynx, whereas the HBM in jawed vertebrates is internalized and anteroposteriorly specified. Precursor cells of the HBM, marked by expression ofLbx1, originate from somites and undergo extensive migration before becoming innervated by the hypoglossal nerve. How the complex form of HBM arose in evolution is relevant to the establishment of the vertebrate body plan, but despite having long been assumed to be similar to that of limb muscles, modification of developmental mechanisms of HBM remains enigmatic. Results Here we characterize the expression ofLbxgenes in lamprey and hagfish (cyclostomes) and catshark (gnathostome; jawed vertebrates). We show that the expression patterns of the single cyclostomeLbxhomologue,Lbx-A, do not resemble the somitic expression of mammalianLbx1. Disruption ofLbx-Arevealed thatLjLbx-Ais required for the formation of both HBM and body wall muscles, likely due to the insufficient extension of precursor cells rather than to hindered muscle differentiation. Both homologues ofLbxin the catshark were expressed in the somitic muscle primordia, unlike in amniotes. During catshark embryogenesis,Lbx2is expressed in the caudal HBM as well as in the abdominal rectus muscle, similar to lampreyLbx-A, whereasLbx1marks the rostral HBM and pectoral fin muscle. Conclusions We conclude that the vertebrate HBM primarily emerged as a specialized somatic muscle to cover the pharynx, and the anterior internalized HBM of the gnathostomes is likely a novelty added rostral to the cyclostome-like HBM, for which duplication and functionalization ofLbxgenes would have been a prerequisite.","[Kusakabe, Rie; Higuchi, Shinnosuke; Tanaka, Masako; Kuratani, Shigeru] RIKEN Ctr Biosyst Dynam Res BDR, Lab Evolutionary Morphol, Chuo Ku, 2-2-3 Minatojima Minami, Kobe, Hyogo 6500047, Japan; [Higuchi, Shinnosuke] Kobe Univ, Grad Sch Sci, Dept Biol, Kobe, Hyogo 6578501, Japan; [Higuchi, Shinnosuke] Hiroshima Univ, Grad Sch Biomed & Hlth Sci, Dept Mol Biol & Biochem, Hiroshima 7348553, Japan; [Kadota, Mitsutaka; Nishimura, Osamu] RIKEN Ctr Biosyst Dynam Res BDR, Lab Phyloinformat, Kobe, Hyogo 6500047, Japan; [Kuratani, Shigeru] RIKEN Cluster Pioneering Res CPR, Evolutionary Morphol Lab, Kobe, Hyogo 6500047, Japan","Kusakabe, R (corresponding author), RIKEN Ctr Biosyst Dynam Res BDR, Lab Evolutionary Morphol, Chuo Ku, 2-2-3 Minatojima Minami, Kobe, Hyogo 6500047, Japan.",rie.kusakabe@riken.jp,,,Takeda Science FoundationTakeda Science Foundation (TSF) [19K06683];  [17H06385],This work has been funded by Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (C) (19K06683) and Takeda Science Foundation to R.K. and Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research on Innovative Areas (Research in a Proposed Research Area) (17H06385) to S.K.,,56,0,0,0,0,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",,1741-7007,,BMC BIOL,BMC Biol.,Sep-09,2020,18,1,,,,,,,120,10.1186/s12915-020-00851-y,,,11,Biology,Life Sciences & Biomedicine - Other Topics,NR6NB,WOS:000571678400002,32907560,"DOAJ Gold, Green Published",,,9/10/20

The obtained data, along with a comparison to the composition of conodont apatite, show the presence of a few generations of diagenetic phosphate phases. A thin, outer layer of the spines is composed of very early diagenetic phosphate, which incrusted the original cuticle layer contributing to the preservation of an original shape and structural details of the fossils. This process can be linked to the 'Orsten'-type phosphatization mainly known from Lower Palaeozoic strata. Successive phosphate generations are observed within the middle and inner layers as well as internal cavities of the spines. Plastic deformations and diagenetic features of the spines show that they were originally composed of slightly flexible chitinous organic matter similar to that of modern chaetognaths. This conclusion is substantiated by rare findings of purely organic remnants of Cambrian chaetognath grasping spines.","[Wierzbowski, Hubert] Polish Geol Inst, Natl Res Inst, Ul Rakowiecka 4, PL-00975 Warsaw, Poland; [Szaniawski, Hubert; Blazejowski, Blazej] Polish Acad Sci, Inst Paleobiol, Ul Twarda 51-55, PL-00818 Warsaw, Poland","Wierzbowski, H (corresponding author), Polish Geol Inst, Natl Res Inst, Ul Rakowiecka 4, PL-00975 Warsaw, Poland.",hubert.wierzbowski@pgsi.gov.pl; szaniaw@twarda.pan.pl; bblazej@twarda.pan.pl,,,"National Science Centre, PolandNational Science Centre, Poland [2016/21/B/ST10/02334]; Polish Geological Institute-National Research Institute [62.9012.1907.00.0]","This study has been supported by the grant no. 2016/21/B/ST10/02334 (supervisor H.

Chondrichthyans (sharks and their kin) are the living sister group of osteichthyans and have primarily cartilaginous endoskeletons, long considered the ancestral condition for all jawed vertebrates (gnathostomes). The absence of bone in modern jawless fishes and the absence of endochondral ossification in early fossil gnathostomes appear to lend support to this conclusion. Here we report the discovery of extensive endochondral bone inMinjinia turgenensis, a new genus and species of 'placoderm'-like fish from the Early Devonian (Pragian) of western Mongolia described using X-ray computed microtomography. The fossil consists of a partial skull roof and braincase with anatomical details providing strong evidence of placement in the gnathostome stem group. However, its endochondral space is filled with an extensive network of fine trabeculae resembling the endochondral bone of osteichthyans. Phylogenetic analyses place this new taxon as a proximate sister group of the gnathostome crown. These results provide direct support for theories of generalized bone loss in chondrichthyans. Furthermore, they revive theories of a phylogenetically deeper origin of endochondral bone and its absence in chondrichthyans as a secondary condition. Minjinia turgenensis, an Early Devonian fish, preserves anatomical details consistent with it being a stem gnathostome, but also endochondral bone similar to that of osteichthyans. These findings suggest that endochondral bone is an ancestral condition subsequently lost in chondrichthyans.","[Brazeau, Martin D.; Dearden, Richard P.; Jerve, Anna; Castiello, Marco] Imperial Coll London, Dept Life Sci, Ascot, Berks, England; [Brazeau, Martin D.; Giles, Sam] Nat Hist Museum, Dept Earth Sci, London, England; [Giles, Sam] Univ Birmingham, Sch Geog Earth & Environm Sci, Birmingham, W Midlands, England; [Giles, Sam] Univ Oxford, Dept Earth Sci, Oxford, England; [Dearden, Richard P.] Sorbonne Univ, CNRS, Museum Natl Hist Nat, CR2P Ctr Rech Paleontol Paris, Paris, France; [Jerve, Anna] Uppsala Univ, Subdept Evolut & Dev, Dept Organismal Biol, Uppsala, Sweden; [Ariunchimeg, Ya] Nat Hist Museum, Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia; [Zorig, E.] Mongolian Acad Sci, Inst Paleontol, Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia; [Sansom, Robert] Univ Manchester, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Guillerme, Thomas] Univ Sheffield, Dept Anim & Plant Sci, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England","Brazeau, MD (corresponding author), Imperial Coll London, Dept Life Sci, Ascot, Berks, England.; Brazeau, MD (corresponding author), Nat Hist Museum, Dept Earth Sci, London, England.",m.brazeau@imperial.ac.uk,"Guillerme, Thomas/G-9833-2014","Guillerme, Thomas/0000-0003-4325-1275; Brazeau, Martin/0000-0002-0650-1282; Giles, Sam/0000-0001-9267-4392","National Geographic SocietyNational Geographic Society [CRE 8769-10, GEFNE35-12]; Smalands Nation, Uppsala University; Royal Society Research GrantRoyal Society of London; University of Manchester; European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme (FP/2007-2013)/ERC GrantEuropean Research Council (ERC) [311092]; ile-de-France DIM (Domaine d'Interet Majeur) Materiaux Anciens et Patrimoniaux grant PHARE; Royal Society Dorothy Hodgkin Research FellowshipRoyal Society of London; Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences; College of Literature, Science, and the Arts; Willi Hennig Society","M.

This study aims to provide the first detailed descriptions of intertidal pools, along with their hosted thrombolite and stromatolite structures, from Abu Dhabi, and to propose a model for their formation and evolution. It is proposed that the development of pools within the upper intertidal zone was initiated by localized erosion of the laminated microbial mats during high energy events. The removal of the protective mats permitted erosion of the underlying unconsolidated sediment to produce erosional scours that continued to develop to create the pools observed today. The margins of the newly-created submerged environment were colonized by a cyanobacteria dominated microbial community. The precipitation of aragonite cement, associated with the cyanobacteria, stabilized the pool walls and cemented the microbial communities to form stromatolitic and thrombolitic fabrics. Syndepositional cementation was further enhanced by the precipitation of marine cements as a result of evaporation-driven Ca(2+)and Mg(2+)supersaturation. Erosion behind and below the cemented pool wall eventually resulted in rim-collapse and the formation of the observed pool margin parallel thrombolite bands. Successive generations of lithification and erosion increased the area of the pool with the earliest thrombolites eroding and becoming increasingly isolated. In summary, the resultant microbialites developed through the complex interplay of erosion, abiotic early lithification and microbially-mediated processes, and represent a continuum between unlithified laminated microbial mats and domal microbialites. These features are most likely produced during a sea-level scenario of stillstand or transgression and, as such, may be useful as a diagnostic tool to elucidate the onset of transgression. The newly proposed model for stromatolite formation has significant implications for the recognition and interpretation of similar structures observed in the fossil record.","[Paul, Andreas; Lokier, Stephen W.; Court, Wesley M.] Khalifa Univ Sci & Technol, Petr Inst, Dept Geosci, POB 2533, Abu Dhabi, U Arab Emirates; [Lokier, Stephen W.] Bangor Univ, Sch Ocean Sci, Bangor LL57 2DG, Gwynedd, Wales; [Sherry, Angela; Andrade, Luiza Lessa; van der Land, Cees; Dutton, Kirsten E.; Head, Ian M.] Newcastle Univ, Sch Nat & Environm Sci, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England; [Sherry, Angela] Northumbria Univ, Dept Appl Sci, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 8ST, Tyne & Wear, England","Lokier, SW (corresponding author), Khalifa Univ Sci & Technol, Petr Inst, Dept Geosci, POB 2533, Abu Dhabi, U Arab Emirates.; Lokier, SW (corresponding author), Bangor Univ, Sch Ocean Sci, Bangor LL57 2DG, Gwynedd, Wales.",s.lokier@bangor.ac.uk,,,Petroleum Institute Research Centre (PIRC/ADRIC) [LTR15003],"This study was funded by the Petroleum Institute Research Centre (PIRC/ADRIC) through project LTR15003 titled `Understanding ancient petroleum carbonate systems; carbonate precipitation in Abu Dhabi microbial mats as a modern analogue'.

SPSPA has low species richness and high endemism; nonetheless, the diversity of fishes from deep habitats (>30 m depth) had not been previously studied in detail. Several expeditions conducted between 2009 and 2018 explored the shallow and deep reefs of SPSPA using scuba, closed-circuit rebreathers, manned submersibles, baited remote underwater stereo-videos (stereo-BRUV) and fishing between 0 and 1050 m depth. These expeditions yielded 41 new records of fishes for SPSPA: 9 in open waters, 9 in shallow waters (0-30 m), 8 in mesophotic ecosystems (30-150 m) and 15 in deeper reefs (>150 m). Combined with literature records of adult pelagic, shallow and deep-reef species, as well as larvae, the database of the fish biodiversity for SPSPA currently comprises 225 species (169 recorded as adult fishes and 79 as larvae, with 23 species found in both stages). Most of them (112) are pelagic, 86 are reef-associated species and 27 are deep-water specialists. Species accumulation curves show that the number of fish species has not yet reached an asymptote. Whereas the number of species recorded in SPSPA is similar to that in other oceanic islands in the Atlantic Ocean, the proportion of shorefishes is relatively lower, and the endemism level is the third highest in the Atlantic. Twenty-nine species are listed as threatened with extinction. Observations confirm the paucity of top predators on shallow rocky reefs of the island, despite the presence of several pelagic shark species around SPSPA. Because all of the endemic species are reef associated, it is argued that the new marine-protected areas created by the Brazilian government do not ensure the protection and recovery of SPSPA's biodiversity because they allow exploitation of the most vulnerable species around the archipelago itself. This study suggests a ban on reef fish exploitation inside an area delimited by the 1000 m isobath around the islands (where all known endemics are concentrated) as the main conservation strategy to be included in the SPSPA management plan being prepared by the Brazilian government.","[Pinheiro, Hudson T.; Rocha, Luiz A.] Calif Acad Sci, Dept Ichthyol, San Francisco, CA 94118 USA; [Macena, Bruno C.

Oceanic whitetip sharks are large pelagic sharks distributed circumglobally and recent IUCN assessments classified them as critically endangered. Considering their vulnerability, we investigated the intraspecific diversity and genetic stock structure of oceanic whitetip shark,Carcharhinus longimanus, along the Indian coast using mitochondrial control region sequences so that viable management guidelines can be formulated in the Indian Ocean region. Population genetic analyses revealed a lack of significant genetic differentiation along the Indian coast indicating substantial gene flow and connectivity among populations. Comparisons of data of the present study with that of Atlantic Ocean regions indicated significant connectivity and gene flow between Indian and East Atlantic regions and a lack of connectivity between Indian and West Atlantic Ocean regions. Oceanic whitetip sharks have substantial capacity for oceanic migration resulting in the mixing of gene pools. Despite these capabilities, overfishing is one of the major drivers of population decline worldwide, resulting in severe fragmentation of populations. Based on the results of the present study, this species can be managed as a single stock along the Indian coast. Further co-management measures along with countries bordering East Atlantic coast can also be devised.

Such extrapolations are particularly risky when allometry is present. The extinct giant shark dagger Otodus megalodon is known almost exclusively from fossilised teeth. Estimates of dagger O. megalodon body size have been made from its teeth, using the great white shark (Carcharodon carcharias) as the only modern analogue. This can be problematic as the two species likely belong to different families, and the position of the dagger Otodus lineage within Lamniformes is unclear. Here, we infer dagger O. megalodon body dimensions based on anatomical measurements of five ecologically and physiologically similar extant lamniforms: Carcharodon carcharias, Isurus oxyrinchus, Isurus paucus, Lamna ditropis and Lamna nasus. We first assessed for allometry in all analogues using linear regressions and geometric morphometric analyses. Finding no evidence of allometry, we made morphological extrapolations to infer body dimensions of dagger O. megalodon at different sizes. Our results suggest that a 16 m dagger O. megalodon likely had a head similar to 4.65 m long, a dorsal fin similar to 1.62 m tall and a tail similar to 3.85 m high. Morphometric analyses further suggest that its dorsal and caudal fins were adapted for swift predatory locomotion and long-swimming periods.","[Cooper, Jack A.; Ferron, Humberto G.; Benton, Michael J.] Univ Bristol, Sch Earth Sci, Bristol BS8 1RJ, Avon, England; [Pimiento, Catalina] Swansea Univ, Dept Biosci, Swansea SA2 8PP, W Glam, Wales; [Pimiento, Catalina] Smithsonian Trop Res Inst, Balboa, Panama; [Pimiento, Catalina] Univ Zurich, Paleontol Inst & Museum, CH-8006 Zurich, Switzerland","Pimiento, C (corresponding author), Swansea Univ, Dept Biosci, Swansea SA2 8PP, W Glam, Wales.; Pimiento, C (corresponding author), Smithsonian Trop Res Inst, Balboa, Panama.; Pimiento, C (corresponding author), Univ Zurich, Paleontol Inst & Museum, CH-8006 Zurich, Switzerland.",c.pimiento@swansea.ac.uk,"; Benton, Michael/A-5639-2008","Ferron, Humberto/0000-0003-2254-8424; Benton, Michael/0000-0002-4323-1824",European Union's Horizon 2020 Research and innovation programme under the Marie Skodowska-Curie Grant [663830]; Marie Skodowska-Curie Individual FellowshipEuropean Union (EU) [H2020-MSCA-IF-2018-839636]; NERCNERC Natural Environment Research Council [NE/I027630/1],"We thank M.

The gene encoding this protein has a paralog which was first identified to be expressed exclusively in the testis in mammals and designated as CTCFL (also called BORIS). CTCFL orthologs were reported only among amniotes, and thus CTCFL was once thought to have arisen in the amniote lineage. In this study, we identified elasmobranch CTCFL orthologs, and investigated its origin with the aid of a shark genome assembly improved by proximity-guided scaffolding. Our analysis employing evolutionary interpretation of syntenic gene location suggested an earlier timing of the gene duplication between CTCF and CTCFL than previously thought, that is, around the common ancestor of extant vertebrates. Also, our transcriptomic sequencing revealed a biased expression of the catshark CTCFL in the testis, suggesting the origin of the tissue-specific localization in mammals more than 400 million years ago. To understand the historical process of the functional consolidation of the long-standing chromatin regulator CTCF, its additional paralogs remaining in some of the descendant lineages for spatially restricted transcript distribution should be taken into consideration.","[Kadota, Mitsutaka; Yamaguchi, Kazuaki; Hara, Yuichiro; Kuraku, Shigehiro] RIKEN Ctr Biosyst Dynam Res BDR, Lab Phyloinformat, Kobe, Hyogo, Japan; [Hara, Yuichiro] Tokyo Metropolitan Inst Med Sci, Res Ctr Genome & Med Sci, Setagaya Ku, 2-1-6 Kamikitazawa, Tokyo 1568506, Japan","Kuraku, S (corresponding author), RIKEN Ctr Biosyst Dynam Res BDR, Lab Phyloinformat, Kobe, Hyogo, Japan.",shigehiro.kuraku@riken.jp,,,,,,40,0,0,0,0,NATURE RESEARCH,BERLIN,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, BERLIN, 14197, GERMANY",2045-2322,,,SCI REP-UK,Sci Rep,Sep-03,2020,10,1,,,,,,,14629,10.1038/s41598-020-71602-w,,,11,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,NR0BM,WOS:000571229700121,32884037,"DOAJ Gold, Green Published",,,9/10/20

In this work, the influence of the scales of fish on the laminar-to-turbulent transition in the boundary layer is investigated. Arrays of biomimetic fish scales in typical overlapping arrangements are placed on a flat plate in a low-turbulence laminar water channel. Transition to turbulence is triggered by controlled excitation of a Tollmien-Schlichting (TS) wave. It was found that the TS wave can be attenuated with scales on the plate which generate streamwise streaks. As a consequence, the transition location was substantially delayed in the downstream direction by 55% with respect to the uncontrolled reference case. This corresponds to a theoretical drag reduction of about 27%. We thus hypothesize that fish scales can stabilize the laminar boundary layer and prevent it from early transition, reducing friction drag. This technique can possibly be used for bio-inspired surfaces as a laminar flow control means.","[Muthuramalingam, Muthukumar; Bruecker, Christoph] City Univ London, Sch Math Comp Sci & Engn, London EC1V 0HB, England; [Puckert, Dominik K.; Rist, Ulrich] Univ Stuttgart, Inst Aerodynam & Gasdynam, Pfaffenwaldring 21, D-70569 Stuttgart, Germany","Muthuramalingam, M (corresponding author), City Univ London, Sch Math Comp Sci & Engn, London EC1V 0HB, England.",muthukumar.muthuramalingam@city.ac.uk,,"Muthuramalingam, Muthukumar/0000-0003-0018-3890",BAE SYSTEMS; Royal Academy of EngineeringRoyal Academy of Engineering - UK [RCSRF1617\4\11]; Deutsche ForschungsgemeinschaftGerman Research Foundation (DFG) [BR 1494/32-1]; DFGGerman Research Foundation (DFG) [RI 680/39-1],"The position of Professor Christoph Bruecker is co-funded by BAE SYSTEMS and the Royal Academy of Engineering (Research Chair No. RCSRF1617\4\11, which is gratefully acknowledged.

In marine systems, artificial reefs are often deployed to restore degraded reefs or supplement existing reefs, but it remains unknown whether these interventions benefit large predators. Comparative field surveys of thirty artificial and natural reefs across similar to 200 km of the North Carolina, USA coast revealed large reef-associated predators were more dense on artificial than natural reefs. This pattern was associated with higher densities of transient predators (e.g. jacks, mackerel, barracuda, sharks) on artificial reefs, but not of resident predators (e.g., grouper, snapper). Further analyses revealed that this pattern of higher transient predator densities on artificial reefs related to reef morphology, as artificial reefs composed of ships hosted higher transient predator densities than concrete reefs. The strength of the positive association between artificial reefs and transient predators increased with a fundamental habitat trait-vertical extent. Taller artificial reefs had higher densities of transient predators, even when accounting for habitat area. A global literature review of high trophic level fishes on artificial and natural habitats suggests that the overall pattern of more predators on artificial habitats is generalizable. Together, these findings provide evidence that artificial habitats, especially those like sunken ships that provide high vertical structure, may support large predators.","[Paxton, Avery B.] CSS Inc, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA; [Paxton, Avery B.; Silliman, Brian R.] Duke Univ, Marine Lab, Nicholas Sch Environm, Beaufort, NC 28516 USA; [Newton, Emily A.; Adler, Alyssa M.; Van Hoeck, Rebecca V.; Peterson, Charles H.] Univ N Carolina, Inst Marine Sci, Morehead City, NC USA; [Iversen, Edwin S.] Duke Univ, Dept Stat Sci, Durham, NC USA; [Taylor, J.

Concretely, the Mediterranean Sea is facing a huge demand of resources and marine activities while hosting abundant and unique biodiversity. It is considered an important elasmobranch hotspot where seventy-two elasmobranch species are present in the basin. Despite the recognised importance of elasmobranchs as umbrella species, to date only a small number of marine protected areas have been designated towards their protection. The paucity of spatially-explicit abundance data on elasmobranchs often precludes the designation of these areas to protect these marine predators. Here, we aimed to identify marine areas to protect elasmobranch species by means of a systematic spatial planning approach. We first estimated the spatial distribution of five elasmobranch species (three sharks and two rays) in the western Mediterranean Sea and then applied Marxan decision support tools to find priority marine conservation areas. We found that the five elasmobranchs are distributed in coastal and slope areas of the southern waters of the study area while in the northern region they are abundant in the continental slope and towards offshore waters. Conservation priority areas were identified in the southern part of the western Mediterranean. Adding more complex cost layers and zoning to the analysis did not alter conservation priority areas, confirming such areas are highly consistent and highly important for elasmobranch protection. The marine conservation priority areas identified here can contribute to designate a proactive area-based protection strategy towards elasmobranch conservation, related species and the habitats that they depend in the western Mediterranean Sea.","[Gimenez, Joan; Coll, Marta; Navarro, Joan] Inst Ciencies Mar CSIC, Passeig Maritim de la Barceloneta 37-49, Barcelona 08003, Spain; [Gimenez, Joan] Univ Coll Cork, MaREI Ctr, Environm Res Inst, Cork, Ireland; [Gimenez, Joan] Univ Coll Cork, Sch Biol Earth & Environm Sci BEES, Cork, Ireland; [Cardador, Laura] Ctr Recerca Ecol & Aplicac Forestals CREAF, Cerdanyola Del Valles 08193, Spain; [Mazor, Tessa] Univ Queensland, Sch Biol Sci, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Kark, Salit] Univ Queensland, Ctr Biodivers & Conservat Sci, Sch Biol Sci, Biodivers Res Grp, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Maria Bellido, Jose] Ctr Oceanog Murcia, Inst Espanol Oceanog IEO, Calle Varadero 1,Apdo 22, Murcia 30740, Spain","Gimenez, J (corresponding author), Inst Ciencies Mar CSIC, Passeig Maritim de la Barceloneta 37-49, Barcelona 08003, Spain.",gimenez.verdugo@gmail.com,"Gimenez, Joan/C-6107-2015; Navarro, Joan/C-2119-2009","Gimenez, Joan/0000-0001-9207-4792; Navarro, Joan/0000-0002-5756-9543","Spanish Ministry of Economy, Industry, and Competitiveness of the Spanish Government through the predoctoral mobility grant for research internships in foreign R + D centers [EEBB-I-2017-12238]; Spanish National Program Ramon y CajalGerman Research Foundation (DFG) [RYC-2015-17809]; Beatriu de Pinos fellowship program (Catalan Government); Beatriu de Pinos fellowship program (EU COFUND program) [801370]; Horizon 2020 Framework Programme for research and innovation [15121]; project SafeNET [15121, EU-DGMARE MARE/2014/41]; RESNEP (Spanish Government) [15121, CTM2017-82991-C2-1-R]; European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF) of the EU, within the Spanish programme","The authors also express their gratitude to all the people incolved in the MEDITS surveys.

The three tidal inlet systems, Coos Bay, Oregon, Shark River Inlet, New Jersey, and John's Pass, Florida, represented high-, medium-, and low-wave energy regimes for U.S. inlets (Pacific, Atlantic, and Gulf of Mexico Coasts, respectively). Three methods employed to define sediment pathways from the results of a numerical morphology model were evaluated: (1) morphodynamic interpretation, (2) mean transport vectors across the modeled inlet, and (3) sediment tracer migration. The sediment tracing methodology employed in this study allowed for an evaluation of the sediment transport pathways between the various morphologic features of a tidal inlet, as well as their respective processes that drive the exchange of sediments. Characterizing and correlating the dominant and subdominant, or seasonal, sediment pathways between tidal inlet morphologic features (sediment reservoirs) can improve long-term models of an inlet sediment system. Divergences in pathways to subfeature shoals of a complex tidal inlet shoal, such as the updrift and downdrift shoals of an ebb-tidal delta, can be resolved through tracking sediment migration. The results of this study illustrate the value of including sediment-tracking techniques in simulating sediment bypassing and the potential of this application to inform coastal engineering and design modifications to the sediment reservoirs of tidal inlet systems.","[Beck, Tanya M.; Li, Honghai] US Army, Coastal & Hydraul Lab, Engineer Res & Dev Ctr, Vicksburg, MS 39180 USA; [Beck, Tanya M.; Wang, Ping] Univ S Florida, Coastal Res Lab, Sch Geosci, Tampa, FL 33620 USA; [Wu, Weiming] Clarkson Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Potsdam, NY 13699 USA","Beck, TM (corresponding author), US Army, Coastal & Hydraul Lab, Engineer Res & Dev Ctr, Vicksburg, MS 39180 USA.; Beck, TM (corresponding author), Univ S Florida, Coastal Res Lab, Sch Geosci, Tampa, FL 33620 USA.",Tanya.M.Beck@usace.army.mil,,,U.S. Army Engineer Research and Development Center's (ERDC) Coastal Inlets Research Program (CIRP),"This study benefited from the helpful suggestions of Drs.

However, detailed functional analysis such as their interaction with glycan binding proteins (GBPs) has been lagging, presumably due to the unavailability of well-defined, diverse structures. Besides challenging chemical and enzymatic synthesis, this is also due to the challenges in their purification at the isomer level and structural analysis owing to their instability, structural complexity, and low mass spectrometry detection sensitivity. Herein, we first used recycling preparative HPLC to separate and purify shark CS tetrasaccharide component labeled by a bifunctional fluorescent linker 2-amino-N- 2-aminoethyObenzamide (AEAB) at the isomer level. Then, each isomer was derivatized through a multistage procedure including N-acetylation, carboxyl amidation, permethylation, and desulfation with silylating reagent. Structural analysis of each derivatized isomer was performed with ESI- MSn in positive ion mode. A total of 16 isomers of CSO-AEAB were isolated, with a minimum mass component of 0.007 mg and a maximum mass component of 17.53 mg, of which 10 isomers (>90 mu g) were structurally analyzed. This preparation and structure analysis of CSOs lay the foundation for further study of the structure-activity relationship of CSOs.","[Wei, Ming; Huang, Linjuan; Jin, Wanjun; Wang, Zhongfu] Northwest Univ, Coll Life Sci, Xian 710069, Peoples R China; [Huang, Linjuan; Liu, Yuxia; Yao, Xinbo; Rong, Jinqiao; Wang, Zhongfu] Northwest Univ, Shaanxi Nat Carbohydrate Resource Engn Res Ctr, Coll Food Sci & Technol, Xian 710069, Peoples R China; [Bai, Fan; Song, Xuezheng] Emory Univ, Dept Biochem, Sch Med, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA","Wang, ZF (corresponding author), Northwest Univ, Coll Life Sci, Xian 710069, Peoples R China.; Wang, ZF (corresponding author), Northwest Univ, Shaanxi Nat Carbohydrate Resource Engn Res Ctr, Coll Food Sci & Technol, Xian 710069, Peoples R China.; Song, XZ (corresponding author), Emory Univ, Dept Biochem, Sch Med, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA.",xsong2@emory.edu; wangzhf@nwu.edu.cn,,"song, xuezheng/0000-0003-1751-2785","National Key Research and Development Program of China [2018YFD0901101]; National Natural Science Fundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [31972024, 31670808, 31870798]; NIH Common Fund Glycoscience [U01GM116254]","This work was supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (Grant No. 2018YFD0901101) and the National Natural Science Fundation of China (Grant Nos. 31972024, 31670808, and 31870798).

Owing to their tunable photoluminescence properties, carbon-based luminescent nanomaterials have shown great potential in bioimaging, photocatalysis, and biosensing among other applications. Results: Marine environments provide excellent resources for the fabrication of these nanomaterials, because many marine organisms contain interesting trigger organic compounds that can be used as precursors. Herein, we synthesize multi-color emissive carbon dots (CDs) with an intrinsic photoluminescence quantum yield of 20.46%. These nanostructures were achieved through the one-step hydrothermal treatment of marine polysaccharide chondroitin sulfate, obtained from shark cartilage, in aqueous solution. Conclusions: We successfully demonstrate the low toxicity of our marine resource-derived CDs in zebrafish, and provide an initial assessment of their possible use as a bioimaging agent. Notably, the newly synthesized CDs localize in the intestines of zebrafish larvae, thereby indicating their biocompatibility and potential use as in vivo dyes.

Implementing spatial management for conservation of hammerhead populations requires knowledge of temporal distribution patterns and habitat use, identification of essential habitat for protection, and quantification of interactions with human activities. There is little such information for the smooth hammerhead shark, Sphyrna zygaena. We used fin-mounted satellite tags to examine the movements and habitat use of juvenile smooth hammerheads, a demographic segment particularly threatened by exploitation. Six sharks were tagged off the US mid-Atlantic and tracked for 49-441 days (mean 187 +/- 136 days). Sharks consistently showed area-restricted movements within a summer core area in waters of the New York Bight and a winter core area off Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, with directed movements between them in autumn. There was high overlap of shark winter core area use and the Mid-Atlantic Shark Area (MASA) - a 7 month per year, bottom-longline fishery closure - indicating that this area closure offers seasonal reduction in fishing pressure for this species. Based on timing of shark movements and the MASA closure, protection for juvenile smooth hammerheads may be increased by beginning the closure period 1 month earlier than currently scheduled. Generalized additive mixed models revealed that area-restricted movements of sharks in their summer and winter core areas coincided with high primary productivity, and elevated sea surface temperature. Consistency in use of summer and winter core areas suggests that the coastal waters of the New York Bight and Cape Hatteras, North Carolina could be considered for Essential Fish Habitat designation for this species. This study reveals the first high resolution movements and habitat use for smooth hammerheads in the western North Atlantic to inform management planning for this population.","[Logan, Ryan K.; Vaudo, Jeremy J.; Wetherbee, Bradley M.; Shivji, Mahmood S.] Nova Southeastern Univ, Guy Harvey Res Inst, Dania, FL 33004 USA; [Logan, Ryan K.; Vaudo, Jeremy J.; Shivji, Mahmood S.] Nova Southeastern Univ, Save Our Seas Fdn, Shark Res Ctr, Dania, FL 33004 USA; [Sousa, Lara L.] Univ Oxford, Recanati Kaplan Ctr, Dept Zool, Wildlife Conservat Res Unit, Tubney, England; [Sampson, Mark] Fish Finder Adventures, Ocean City, MD USA; [Wetherbee, Bradley M.] Univ Rhode Isl, Dept Biol Sci, Kingston, RI 02881 USA","Logan, RK; Shivji, MS (corresponding author), Nova Southeastern Univ, Guy Harvey Res Inst, Dania, FL 33004 USA.; Logan, RK; Shivji, MS (corresponding author), Nova Southeastern Univ, Save Our Seas Fdn, Shark Res Ctr, Dania, FL 33004 USA.",rlogan@nova.edu; mahmood@nova.edu,,"Logan, Ryan/0000-0002-4714-5632",Guy Harvey Ocean Foundation [GHOF18-1]; Save Our Seas Foundation [SOSF157]; Shark Foundation/Hai-Stiftung [HF-192]; Levitetz Family Foundation [LFF-19]; Fish Florida,"This work was supported by grants to MSS from the Guy Harvey Ocean Foundation (GHOF18-1), Save Our Seas Foundation (SOSF157), Shark Foundation/Hai-Stiftung (HF-192), the Levitetz Family Foundation (LFF-19), and a scholarship to RL from Fish Florida.",,76,0,0,0,0,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,2296-7745,,FRONT MAR SCI,Front.

This high marine biodiversity makes the Isla del Coco National Park (PNIC) a very attractive place for illegal fishers. We analyzed a dataset covering 8 years (2003-2010) of patrol records from PNIC with the aim of determining, a) the spatial-temporal distribution of illegal fishing, b) other areas that could be prone to illegal fishing but are currently undetected, c) the most profitable areas for this activity and d) the economic trade-offs of this illegal activity in relation to potential gains and the costs. Residuals Autocovariate Generalized Additive Models (RAC-GAMs) were used to model the illegal fishing activity's spatial distribution in relation to topographic, biological and temporal (quarter of the year) variables. The final RAC-GAM showed that bathymetry, distance from the coast, slope of the seabed, and yellowfin tuna and silky shark abundance were the most important predictors of this activity. Predictive maps suggest a major trend in the abundance of illegal fishing between the second and third quarters of the year in waters surrounding a seamount within the Park. Maps of the most profitable areas highlighted a specific risk location that should be intensively monitored. Overall, the potential gains from this activity outweigh the potential costs of being caught. Our findings provide useful information that can be used to optimize enforcement, deter illegal fishing and, consequently, increasing the conservation of the protected species.","[Gonzalez-Andres, Cristina; Luis Sanchez-Lizaso, Jose] Univ Alicante, Dept Ciencias Marinas & Biol Aplicada, Carretera San Vicente del Raspeig S-N, Alicante 03690, Spain; [Gonzalez-Andres, Cristina; Grazia Pennino, Maria] Univ Valencia, Dept Estadist & Invest Operat, Stat Modeling Ecol Grp SMEG, Av Blasco Ibanez 13, Valencia 46010, Spain; [Cortes, Jorge] Univ Costa Rica, Ctr Invest Ciencias Mar & Limnol CIMAR, San Jose 115012060, Costa Rica; [Grazia Pennino, Maria] Inst Espanol Oceanog Ctr Oceanog Vigo, Subida Radio Faro 50-52, Vigo 36390, Pontevedra, Spain","Gonzalez-Andres, C (corresponding author), Univ Alicante, Dept Ciencias Marinas & Biol Aplicada, Carretera San Vicente del Raspeig S-N, Alicante 03690, Spain.",cristinacap80@hotmail.com,,,,,,79,0,0,0,0,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-597X,1872-9460,,MAR POLICY,Mar.

The actors involved in the WSOA as well as the power relationships among them were investigated. Actors helped to elucidate the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats of the WSOA. Tourist Operators, Tourists, a Fishing Cooperative, Non-Governmental Organizations, Academia, and Federal Government institutions were identified as the main groups of actors. All the actors agreed that they have an interest in the use of resources and their conservation but their needs and some perspectives of management differed. An imbalance of power among actors was found, with Federal Governmental institutions holding most power, possibly hindering collective management actions. It is necessary to adapt a management plan that promotes a vision for the future and the integration of the concerns and perspectives of the stakeholders to ensure the sustainability of the WSOA.","[Meza-Arce, Mercedes, I; Malpica-Cruz, Luis] Univ Autonoma Baja California, Inst Invest Oceanol, Carretera Ensenada Tijuana 3917, Ensenada 22860, Baja California, Mexico; [Meza-Arce, Mercedes, I; Malpica-Cruz, Luis; Zertuche-Chanes, Rebeca; Santana-Morales, Omar] ECOCIMATI AC, Av Puerto 2270 Colonia Hidalgo, Ensenada 22880, Baja California, Mexico; [Hoyos-Padilla, Mauricio E.] Pelagios Kajunja AC, Cuauhtemoc 155, La Paz Baja 23060, California Sur, Mexico; [Mojica, Francisco J.] Univ Externado Colombia, Ctr Pensamiento Estrateg & Prospect, Calle 12 1-17 Este, Bogota 111711, Colombia; [Concepcion Arredondo-Garcia, Maria; Santana-Morales, Omar] Univ Autonoma Baja California, Fac Ciencias Marinas, Carretera Ensenada Tijuana 3917, Ensenada 22860, Baja California, Mexico; [Leyva, Claudia] Univ Autonoma Baja California, Fac Ciencias, Carretera Ensenada Tijuana 3917, Ensenada 22860, Baja California, Mexico","Arredondo-Garcia, MC (corresponding author), Carretera Ensenada Tijuana 3917, Ensenada 22860, Baja California, Mexico.",conchita@uabc.edu.mx,,"Hoyos, Edgar/0000-0002-4318-2655",CONACyT-UABCDoctorado en Medio Ambiente y Desarrollo scholarship,"This study would not have been possible without the interest and collaboration to participate during workshops by all the key actors involved in the activity.

In the absence of long-term monitoring data or tracking programs, available information is based on occasional catch or sighting records from a variety of sources, usually constrained in space and time. This study demonstrates the utility of developing temporally explicit habitat suitability (HS) models to infer the migratory pattern of large mobile sharks. Bimonthly presence-only HS models (MaxEnt algorithm) were developed for the broadnose sevengill shark (Notorynchus cepedianus) in the southwest Atlantic based on an exhaustive collection of data records and ecologically relevant predictors. The six final models showed good predictive power and were evaluated with independent data. A migratory pattern characterized by two main displacements was inferred from the models. We show that HS models can be applied as a no-cost, desk-based alternative to infer broadscale movements of large mobile sharks. This methodology is relevant as an important first step toward informing management plans in data-poor and financially limited regions or regions under urgent conservation need.","[Maria De Wysiecki, Agustin; Sanchez-Carnero, Noela; Joaquin Irigoyen, Alejo] Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn CONICET, Ctr Estudio Sistemas Marinos, Puerto Madryn, Argentina; [Conrado Milessi, Andres; Javier Jaureguizar, Andres] Comis Invest Cient Prov Buenos Aires, La Plata, Argentina; [Horacio Colonello, Jorge; Cortes, Federico] Inst Nacl Invest & Desarrollo Pesqucro, Mar Del Plata, Argentina; [Dario Bovcon, Nelson] Univ Nacl Patagonia San Juan Bosco, Inst Hidrobiol, Trelew, Argentina; [Dario Bovcon, Nelson] Secretaria Pesca Prov Chubut, Rawson, Argentina; [Aldo Barbini, Santiago] Univ Nacl Mar del Plata, CONICET, Inst Invest Marinas & Costeras, Mar Del Plata, Argentina; [Victoria Cedrola, Paula] Org Naciones Unidas Alimentac & Agr Argentina, Buenos Aires, Argentina; [Marina Coller, Nidia] Ctr Invest Aplicada & Transferencia Tecnol Recurs, San Antonio Oeste, Argentina; [Javier Jaureguizar, Andres] Inst Argentino Oceanog, Bahia Blanca, Buenos Aires, Argentina; [Javier Jaureguizar, Andres] Univ Prov Sudoeste, Coronel Pringles, Argentina","De Wysiecki, AM (corresponding author), Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn CONICET, Ctr Estudio Sistemas Marinos, Puerto Madryn, Argentina.",adewysiecki@cenpat-conicet.gob.ar,,"De Wysiecki, Agustin Maria/0000-0002-0506-3495","National Scientific and Technical Research Council (CONICET, Argentina)Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET)","The authors give special thanks to professional anglers Luis Solimeno, Matias Llebaria, Juan Ignacio Chiessa, German Hunt, Pablo Panigutto, Antonella Vezzi, and others for their assistance in shark records collection.

These records were used for the creation of a species distribution model using MaxEnt for each of the three aggregation sites. The concentration of chlorophyllaexplained 71% of the habitat suitability, followed by bathymetry and slope with a combined 17%, and sea surface temperature constituting 10% of the model. Habitat suitability was related to areas where nontargeted fisheries may impact whale sharks through bycatch, entanglement and ship strikes.

We developed and pilot tested a novel experimental approach to investigate whether repeated deployments of baited video systems in the same location could generate quantitative data on shark behavioural patterns, in the context of shark depredation (where sharks consume hooked fish). Specifically, we sought to WA whether repeated exposure to boats and food in the same location would lead to a change in the arrival time and first feeding time of sharks, over a short timescale. We used the Ningaloo Marine Park (NMP) in Western Australia, a location where higher shark depredation rates have been identified in consistently fished areas, as a case study. A modified Baited Remote Underwater Video (BRUV) system was repeatedly deployed at two fished sites and two sites within a no-take marine reserve in the NMP, over six consecutive days, to mimic repeated recreational fishing and the availability of hooked fish for sharks to depredate. This approach was designed to investigate and disentangle the potential role of changes in behaviour versus variation in shark abundance, as a mechanism for how and why shark depredation can occur. Here, we report preliminary results from this methodological approach, where time of arrival and time of first feeding declined markedly in the fished site over 6 days of BRUV deployments, compared to the control site in the no-take marine reserve. A greater number of individuals from four carcharhinid species were observed at the fished site, compared to only three individuals from two species in the no-take marine reserve. The preliminary results from pilot testing of this novel experimental approach suggest that, with further modifications to identify individual sharks, and a greater spatial and temporal replication of sampling, it may be possible to identify behavioural changes occurring in sharks in the context of shark depredation. Understanding this mechanism can bring important benefits for fishers and managers, as it can lead to modifications in fishing methods designed at reducing the occurrence of behavioural changes in sharks, and thus mitigating shark depredation.","[Mitchell, J.

The vast majority of NRs are triggered by binding to either endogenous (e.g. retinoic acid) or exogenous (e.g. xenobiotics) ligands, and their evolution and expansion is tightly linked to the function of endocrine systems. Importantly, they represent classic targets of physiological exploitation by endocrine disrupting chemicals. The NR gene repertoire in different lineages has been shaped by gene loss, duplication and mutation, denoting a dynamic evolutionary route. As the earliest diverging class of gnathostomes (jawed vertebrates), cartilaginous fishes offer an exceptional opportunity to address the early diversification of NR gene families and the evolution of the endocrine system in jawed vertebrates. Here we provide an exhaustive analysis into the NR gene composition in five elasmobranch (sharks and rays) and two holocephalan (chimaeras) species. For this purpose, we generated also a low coverage draft genome assembly of the chimaera small-eyed rabbitfish, Hydrolagus affinis. We show that cartilaginous fish retain an archetypal NR gene repertoire, similar to that of mammals and coincident with the two rounds of whole genome duplication that occurred in the gnathostome ancestor. Furthermore, novel gene members of the non-canonical NR0B receptors were found in the genomes of this lineage. Our findings provide an essential view into the early diversification of NRs in gnathostomes, paving the way for functional studies.","[Fonseca, Elza; Machado, Andre M.; Gomes-dos-Santos, Andre; Themudo, Goncalo; Ruivo, Raquel; Santos, Miguel M.; Froufe, Elsa; Castro, L.

Here, we quantitatively analyze euselachian diversity during the last ca. 2 Ma of the Cretaceous using 1518 teeth from 40 vertebrate microfossil localities within the nonmarine facies of the Hell Creek Formation, northeastern Montana, USA. We identify 10 euselachians including one hybodont, five orectolobiforms, one lamniform, one sclerorhynchiform, and two rajiforms. Among these, two are novel and described herein. Diversity metrics reveal an increase in species richness and heterogeneity from the lower to middle portions of the Hell Creek Formation. Thereafter, diversity remained elevated and stable with no turnover until similar to 5 m below the K-Pg boundary. Above this horizon, including the last similar to 50 kyr of the Cretaceous, raw species richnesses dropped precipitously, and all euselachians (except possibly Myledaphus) went locally extinct across the boundary. Preceding this drop in richness, changes in euselachian community structure occurred, including steady declines in the relative abundances of M. pustulosus. These patterns do not support regression of the Western Interior Seaway as the single proximal cause of euselachian extinctions across the K-Pg boundary. Rather, euselachian local extinctions likely were the result of the multiple environmental perturbations occurring just before (volcanism, climate change) and at the K-Pg boundary (bolide impact). This high-resolution temporal pattern of euselachian diversity adds to those from other local taxa (e.g., mammals, lissamphibians) to present a more complex view of the K-Pg mass extinction of the continental biota.

Yet, human-wildlife interactions that result in threat to humans are rarely explicitly addressed in planning and almost not at all in MSP. Rare events of unprovoked shark bites can significantly impact local economies while leading to polarized social debates that often hinder the development of evidence-based shark risk public policy. Here, we suggest an approach for integrating shark risk and its management into MSP. The method addresses simultaneously the spatial, social, and ecological components of shark risk and its inherent uncertainties. The approach is applied on Reunion Island case study where shark risk management is implemented as a response to a rapid increase in the frequency of shark bite events over the past decade. Similar to other countries where shark risk management is implemented, sharks' removal is in the heart of social debate in Reunion Islands (3860 shark fishing operations in 5 years) and data gaps provide a fertile ground for alternative discourses and social conflicts about shark risk. Through a structured public consultation involving 200 stakeholders we demonstrate how MSP can be used to address shark risk while considering multiple sea-uses and conservation objectives. The results suggest that the approach is ideal, both for integrating shark risk as a driver to the MSP process, and for developing a transparent, sustainable and evidence-based shark risk public policy as it places shark risk management within a broader social-ecological spectrum of stakes.","[Shabtay, Ateret; Lagabrielle, Erwann] Univ La Reunion, UMR ESPACE DEV, St Denis, La Reunion, France; [Plot, Virginie; Potin, Gael] Univ La Reunion, CNRS, IRD, UMR ENTROPIE, St Denis, La Reunion, France; [Guyomard, David] Ctr Securite Requin, St Leu, La Reunion, France","Shabtay, A (corresponding author), Univ La Reunion, UMR ESPACE DEV, St Denis, La Reunion, France.",ateret.shabtay-yanai@univ-reunion.fr,,,Reunion Island regional council; European CommissionEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre; European Maritime and Fisheries Fund [EASME/EMFF/2016/1.2.1.6/04/SI2.766484],"This work was supported by the Reunion Island regional council, the European Commission, and the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (grant EASME/EMFF/2016/1.2.1.6/04/SI2.766484).

Just as in the past, present day industrial fishers search for the presence of whale shark as cue to locate tuna schools. These whale shark-tuna associations have been usually assumed to result from the same ecological drivers that govern the attraction of tunas and other fishes towards floating objects or Fish Aggregation Devices (FAD). Yet, this assumption has never been explicitly investigated. As a result, the ecological (evolutionary) significance of the whale shark-tuna associations and the potential impacts of fishing these associations remain unclear. Here, we set out to test a set of predictions expected under the framework of the 'indicator-log' and the 'meeting-point' hypotheses, originally proposed in the context of the tuna-FAD associative behaviour, by contrasting interannual fishing patterns, over 16-years, across highly variable whale shark abundance periods and comparing whale shark associated tuna schools and free swimming schools in the Azores. In addition we also analysed the tuna fishing fleet behaviour over periods of high and low whale shark abundance across the archipelago. We found an overall south and eastward migration of fishing effort towards lower latitudes, where most whale sharks were reported, compared to the low whale shark occurrence period. Overall we found that the whale shark associated school differed from free swimming schools and fishing yields were also influenced by the presence of the whale shark. Specifically, we found that skipjack, bigeye, albacore and yellowfin tuna are caught in higher quantities when associated with whale sharks. Whale shark associated schools were more diverse and yielded smaller fish on average than free-swimming schools, as predicted under the theoretical framework of tuna-FAD associations. Our results highlight the possibility that whale shark behaviour may play an active role in the association dynamics, and that these associations may be mutually beneficial. We argue that whale sharks may represent a meeting point for the aggregation of small tunas and that this behaviour is more likely to be size dependent than species oriented. Finally, we discuss the potential implications of our findings for the management and conservation of both tunas and whale sharks.","[Fontes, Jorge; Machete, Miguel; Afonso, Pedro] OKEANOS UAc Univ Azores, Dept Oceanog & Fisheries, P-9900862 Azores, Horta, Portugal; [Fontes, Jorge; Machete, Miguel; Afonso, Pedro] Univ Azores, Dept Oceanog & Fisheries, Inst Marine Res, IMAR Azores, P-9900862 Horta, Portugal; [McGinty, Niall] Dalhousie Univ, Sch Oceanog, Halifax, NS, Canada","Fontes, J (corresponding author), OKEANOS UAc Univ Azores, Dept Oceanog & Fisheries, P-9900862 Azores, Horta, Portugal.",jorge.mr.fontes@uac.pt,,,"Fundacao para a Ciencia e Tecnologia (FCT)Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology [UID/MAR/04292/2013, UIDB/05634/2020, PTDC/BIA-BMA/32204/2017]; Fundo Regional para a Ciencia e Tecnologia (DRCT) grant [M3.1.a/F/062/2016]; FCTPortuguese Foundation for Science and Technology [IF/01640/2015]","This study was supported by Fundacao para a Ciencia e Tecnologia (FCT), through the strategic projects UID/MAR/04292/2013 granted to MARE, UIDB/05634/2020 granted to Okeanos-UAc and the research project PTDC/BIA-BMA/32204/2017 IslandShark.

The approach is based on three concepts: 1) composition data that are used to determine the component of the population represented by the index should be weighted by CPUE (abundance) while the composition data used to represent the fish removed from the stock should be weighted by catch; 2) due to spatial non-randomness in fishing effort and fish distribution, the index, index composition, and catch composition, should be calculated at a fine spatial scale (e.g., 1 degrees x1 degrees) and summed using area weighting; and 3) fine-scale spatial stratification will likely result in under-sampled and unsampled cells and some form of smoothing method needs to be applied to inform these cells. We illustrate the concepts by applying them to yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares) in the eastern Pacific Ocean.","[Maunder, Mark N.; Xu, Haikun; Oliveros-Ramos, Ricardo; Minte-Vera, Carolina V.; Lennert-Cody, Cleridy E.; Aires-da-Silva, Alexandre M.] Interamer Trop Tuna Commiss, 8901 La Jolla Shores Dr, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Maunder, Mark N.] Ctr Adv Populat Assessment, Methodol, La Jolla, CA USA; [Thorson, James T.] NOAA, Habitat & Ecol Proc Res Program, Alaska Fisheries Sci Ctr, NMFS, Seattle, WA USA; [Hoyle, Simon D.] Natl Inst Water & Atmospher Res Ltd NIWA, 217 Akersten St, Port Nelson 7011, New Zealand; [Tremblay-Boyer, Laura] Dragonfly Data Sci, 158 Victoria 54, Wellington 6011, New Zealand; [Lee, Hui Hua; Piner, Kevin R.] NOAA, Southwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv NMFS, La Jolla, CA USA; [Kai, Mikihiko] Japan Fisheries Res & Educ Agcy, Natl Res Inst Far Seas Fisheries NRIFSF, Shimizu Ku, 5-7-1 Orido, Shizuoka 4248633, Japan; [Chang, Shui-Kai] Natl Sun Yat Sen Univ, Inst Marine Affairs, Kaohsiung, Taiwan; [Kitakado, Toshihide] Tokyo Univ Marine Sci & Technol, Minato Ku, 5-7,Konan 4, Tokyo 1088477, Japan; [Albertsen, Christoffer M.] Tech Univ Denmark, Natl Inst Aquat Resources, Kemitorvet 201, DK-2800 Lyngby, Denmark","Maunder, MN (corresponding author), Interamer Trop Tuna Commiss, 8901 La Jolla Shores Dr, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA.",mmaunder@iattc.org,"Albertsen, Christoffer Moesgaard/P-1108-2014; Thorson, James/O-7937-2014; Chang, Shui-Kai/B-5038-2010","Albertsen, Christoffer Moesgaard/0000-0003-0088-4363; Thorson, James/0000-0001-7415-1010; Chang, Shui-Kai/0000-0003-2929-1510",,,,92,3,3,4,4,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0165-7836,1872-6763,,FISH RES,Fish Res.,SEP,2020,229,,,,,,,,105594,10.1016/j.fishres.2020.105594,,,19,Fisheries,Fisheries,LW4FF,WOS:000539099200008,,,,,9/10/20

Pelagic sharks are increasingly retained by mixed-species fisheries, or are discarded and not reported by selective fisheries for tunas (Thunnusspp.) or swordfish (Xiphias gladius). We estimated the fishing mortality of sharks (landings plus discard mortalities) in a South African-flagged pelagic longline fishery with diverse targeting and discard behaviour. A hierarchical cluster analysis was used to stratify the fleet according to the relative proportions of tunas, swordfish, blue sharks (Prionace glauca) and shortfin mako sharks (Isurus oxyrinchus) landed by individual vessels between 2013 and 2015. A spatial analysis of logbook data indicated that subfleets operated in distinct fishing areas, with overlap. Approximately 5% of all commercial longlines set during 2015 were sampled by a fisheries-independent observer, and the species, discard ratios and physical condition at discard of 6 019 captured sharks were recorded. Blue sharks and shortfin makos dominated observed shark catches, which were comprised of nine species and two species groups. Some 47% of observed sharks were retained and 20% were discarded in good physical condition. Only 4% of shortfin makos were discarded, compared to 68% of blue sharks. Blue shark discard mortality rates were twice as high as published at-vessel mortality rates, suggesting that onboard handling, among other factors, contributed to discard mortalities. Extrapolation to total fishing effort indicated a near 10-fold increase in blue shark and shortfin mako fishing mortality compared to an earlier study (1998-2005). Escalating shortfin mako fishing mortality was attributed to increased targeting to supply higher market demand. Discarding of blue sharks by selective fishing for tunas and swordfish had a greater impact on their fishing mortality than retention by shark-directed fleets. Higher levels of observer sampling are required to increase confidence in discard ratio estimates.","[Jordaan, Gareth L.; Groeneveld, Johan C.] Oceanog Res Inst, Durban, South Africa; [Santos, Jorge] UiT Arctic Univ Norway, Fac Biosci Fisheries & Econ, Tromso, Norway; [Groeneveld, Johan C.] Univ KwaZulu Natal, Sch Life Sci, Pietermaritzburg, Kwazulu Natal, South Africa","Jordaan, GL (corresponding author), Oceanog Res Inst, Durban, South Africa.",jordaan.gareth@gmail.com,,,National Research Foundation (NRF) [96309]; University of KwaZulu-Natal (UKZN),"This work was funded by National Research Foundation (NRF) incentive fund (grant number 96309) to Johan Groeneveld, as well as through a college bursary provided by the University of KwaZulu-Natal (UKZN).

Metals pose health risks to marine organisms and have been associated with oxidative stress, which can lead to protein denaturation, DNA mutations, and cellular apoptosis. Sharks are important species ecologically, recreationally, and commercially. Because they occupy a high trophic level, assessing muscle tissue metal concentrations in sharks may reflect metal transfer in marine food webs. In this study, concentrations of cadmium, copper, lead, nickel, selenium, silver, and zinc were measured in the muscle ofRhizoprionodon terraenovae(Atlantic sharpnose shark) from 12 sites along the coast of the southeastern United States. Activities of antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, and glutathione reductase) also were examined in the muscle tissue ofR. terraenovae. A total of 165 samples were analyzed, and differences in trace element bioaccumulation and enzyme activity were observed across sites.R. terraenovaesamples collected from South Florida and South Carolina had the highest cumulative trace element concentrations whereas those collected from North Carolina and Alabama had the lowest cumulative concentrations. Trace element concentrations in shark muscle tissue were significantly correlated to antioxidant enzyme activity, particularly with glutathione peroxidase, suggesting that this enzyme may serve as a non-lethal, biomarker of metal exposure inR. terraenovae. This is one of the most extensive studies providing reference levels of trace elements and oxidative stress enzymes in a single elasmobranch species within the U.S.","[Somerville, Rachel; Fisher, Maya; Persson, Louise; Bielmyer-Fraser, Gretchen] Jacksonville Univ, 2800 Univ Blvd N, Jacksonville, FL 32211 USA; [Ehnert-Russo, Samantha; Gelsleichter, James] Univ North Florida, 1 UNF Dr, Jacksonville, FL 32224 USA","Somerville, R (corresponding author), Jacksonville Univ, 2800 Univ Blvd N, Jacksonville, FL 32211 USA.",rsomerv@jacksonville.edu; mfisher9@jacksonville.edu; lpersso1@jacksonville.edu; samantha.russo@myfwc.com; jim.gelsleichter@unf.edu; gbielmy@ju.edu,,,"Jacksonville University, via an EPIC grant; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association, National Marine Fisheries Service (NOAA-NMFS), Cooperative Atlantic States Shark Pupping and Nursery Survey Program; Marine Science Research Institute Advisory Board grant","Funding for this project was provided by Jacksonville University, via an EPIC grant to G.K.

In the Ningaloo Reef World Heritage Area located on Australia's mid-west coast, M. alfredi is sighted year-round and is a focal species for ecotourism in the region. Despite value to local tourism and demographic vulnerability to exploitation, basic information regarding M. alfredi movements and area use in this region is lacking. Here we used satellite tags and a long-term photographic-identification database collected by researchers and citizen scientists to examine the species' visitation patterns and regional space use. Tagged M. alfredi remained in coastal shelf waters, preferentially occupying shallow depths < 20 m (76% of depth observations). Comparison of real tracks against those produced by correlated random walk simulations revealed directional dispersal and connectivity between the Ningaloo and Shark Bay World Heritage Areas. The greatest linear distance an individual moved after tagging was similar to 700 km. This movement range is comparable to seasonal M. alfredi migration observed at similar latitudes on Australia's east coast. Photographic-identification of 1121 individual M. alfredi, from 5146 sighting events, revealed that some individuals exhibited long-term site affinity to locations within Ningaloo Marine Park, with the longest spanning 15.16 years (9.8% individuals > 10 years). Lagged Identification Rate analysis suggested site visitation was best described by a pattern of emigration and reimmigration. While our observations of movement and residency establishes basic information previously unknown for the species in this region, the overlap of core area use with existing UNESCO World Heritage Areas demonstrates the potential for well-positioned marine parks to provide protection of critical habitat for M. alfredi.","[Armstrong, Amelia J.; Armstrong, Asia O.; Bennett, Michael B.; Dudgeon, Christine L.] Univ Queensland, Sch Biomed Sci, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Armstrong, Amelia J.; Armstrong, Asia O.; McGregor, Frazer; Richardson, Anthony J.; Bennett, Michael B.; Townsend, Kathy A.; van Keulen, Mike; Smith, Jessica; Dudgeon, Christine L.] Univ Queensland, Project Manta, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [McGregor, Frazer] Murdoch Univ, Coral Bay Field Stn, Coral Bay, WA, Australia; [Richardson, Anthony J.] Univ Queensland, Ctr Appl Resource Math, Brisbane, WA, Australia; [Richardson, Anthony J.] CSIRO Oceans & Atmosphere, Queensland Biosci Precinct, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Townsend, Kathy A.] Univ Sunshine Coast, Sch Sci & Engn, Fraser Coast Campus, Hervey Bay, Qld, Australia; [Hays, Graeme C.] Deakin Univ, Sch Life & Environm Sci, Geelong, Vic, Australia; [van Keulen, Mike] Murdoch Univ, Environm & Conservat Sci, Melville, WA, Australia","Armstrong, AJ (corresponding author), Univ Queensland, Sch Biomed Sci, Brisbane, Qld, Australia.; Armstrong, AJ (corresponding author), Univ Queensland, Project Manta, Brisbane, Qld, Australia.",amelia.armstrong@uqconnect.edu.au,,"Armstrong, Amelia/0000-0001-8103-4314",Australian Research CouncilAustralian Research Council [LP110100712]; Austral Fisheries; TG Kailis Marine Conservation Fund; Murdoch University Coral Bay Research Station; Ningaloo Marine Interactions; Lady Elliot Island Eco Resort; University of Queensland Scholarships,"This research was funded by the Australian Research Council Linkage Grant LP110100712 in partnership with Austral Fisheries, TG Kailis Marine Conservation Fund, Murdoch University Coral Bay Research Station, Ningaloo Marine Interactions, Lady Elliot Island Eco Resort, and University of Queensland Scholarships to AOA and AJA.

Two approaches were used: tip-dating, which allows the extinct taxa to be included as terminals, assessing the phylogenetic relations and their divergence time simultaneously; and basic and minimum branch length ('a posteriori' methods) that date a pre-existing unscaled topology, given a set of stratigraphic data for the taxa involved. We used stratigraphic indexes to compare the divergence ages recovered by both methods. The tip-dating approach obtained a more resolved topology and slightly better stratigraphic index scores than the other methods. Overall the tip-dating analysis recovered slightly earlier divergence ages than the rest of the time dating analyses and the known fossil record of the groups. However, these divergence ages were not as old as those estimated by molecular analysis. Our results suggest the diversity increase through the Late Jurassic-Early Cretaceous might not be gradual, and that Early Cretaceous diversity could be significantly higher. As several divergence events are placed in the Early Cretaceous, there is a suggestion that an active period of cladogenesis leads to the Late Cretaceous high diversity. The last divergence events recovered by the present analysis occurred in the Paleogene and led to the extant groups of batoids.","[Villalobos-Segura, Eduardo; Underwood, Charlie J.] Birkbeck Coll, Sch Earth Sci, Malet St, London WC1E 7HX, England","Villalobos-Segura, E (corresponding author), Birkbeck Coll, Sch Earth Sci, Malet St, London WC1E 7HX, England.",elasmo177@gmail.com; c.underwood@bbk.ac.uk,"Segura, Eduardo/AAQ-9278-2020","Segura, Eduardo/0000-0001-5475-6143",CONACYTConsejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT),"We thank the NHMUK for the use of their facilities and equipment for the preparation of the specimens and M.

Here, we develop species-specific microsatellite markers to better understand the mating system ofE. granulosus. Eighteen litters were opportunistically collected as bycatch along the Madagascar Ridge, Walter's Shoal, and Southern Indian Ocean Ridge. Novel microsatellite loci were used to test for the presence and frequency of multiple paternity and morphological data were obtained from mothers to examine whether litter size or polyandry correlated with female size. Multiple paternity was found in 33% of litters, but no significant relationship between either litter size or the occurrence of polyandry and female size was found, although some adult individuals were found to have high internal relatedness. The frequency of multiple paternity in conjunction with these other factors could be indicators of mating between relatives or a reduction in population size due to fishing pressure.","[Nehmens, Melissa C.; Ebert, David A.] Pacific Shark Res Ctr, Moss Landing Marine Labs, 8272 Moss Landing Rd, Moss Landing, CA 95039 USA; [Feldheim, Kevin A.] Field Museum, Pritzker Lab Mol Systemat & Evolut, 1400 S Lake Shore Dr, Chicago, IL USA; [Ebert, David A.] Calif Acad Sci, Dept Ichthyol, 55 Mus Concourse Dr, San Francisco, CA 94118 USA; [Ebert, David A.] South African Inst Aquat Biodivers, Private Bag 1015, ZA-6140 Grahamstown, South Africa","Nehmens, MC (corresponding author), Pacific Shark Res Ctr, Moss Landing Marine Labs, 8272 Moss Landing Rd, Moss Landing, CA 95039 USA.",mnehmens@gmail.com,,,Prtizker Foundation; Dr. Earl H.

Five sexual maturity stages were recognized based on macroscopic and microscopic evaluation: Immature I (August-October), Immature II (November-January), Mature (February-March), Pregnant (April-May) and Spent (June-July). The structural changes in the oviducts, oviducal glands and uterus throughout the annual reproductive cycle were consistent with their roles in the egg movement, the egg capsule production and sperm storage. The plasma levels of the gonadal steroids were associated with morphological changes in the reproductive tract.

Here, we report a widespread change in the functional diversity of fisheries catches from the large marine ecosystems (LMEs) of the world over the past 65 years (1950 to 2014). The spatial and temporal trends of functional diversity exploited from the LMEs were calculated using global reconstructed marine fisheries catch data provided by the Sea Around Us initiative (including subsistence, artisanal, recreational, industrial fisheries, and discards) and functional trait data available in FishBase. Our analyses uncovered a substantial increase in the functional richness of both ray-finned fishes (80% of LMEs) and cartilaginous species (sharks and rays) (75% of LMESs), in line with an increase in the taxonomic richness, extracted from these ecosystems. The functional evenness and functional divergence of these catches have also altered substantially over the time span of this study, with considerable geographic variation in the patterns detected. These trends show that global fisheries are increasingly targeting species that play diverse roles within the marine ecosystem and underline the importance of incorporating functional diversity in ecosystem management.","[Trindade-Santos, Isaac; Moyes, Faye; Magurran, Anne E.] Univ St Andrews, Sch Biol, Ctr Biol Divers, St Andrews KY16 9TH, Fife, Scotland","Trindade-Santos, I (corresponding author), Univ St Andrews, Sch Biol, Ctr Biol Divers, St Andrews KY16 9TH, Fife, Scotland.",its5@st-andrews.ac.uk,,"Moyes, Faye/0000-0001-9687-0593; Magurran, Anne/0000-0002-0036-2795; Trindade-Santos, Isaac/0000-0003-4478-8103","CAPES (Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel)CAPES [88881.129579/201601, 001]; ERCEuropean Research Council (ERC) [ERCAdGBioTIME 250189, ERCPoCBioCHANGE 727440]; Leverhulme TrustLeverhulme Trust [RPG-2019-402]","I.T.S. thanks CAPES (Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel), process number: #88881.129579/201601 (Finance Code 001) for their support and funding.

As with many elasmobranch species, very little is known about its general biology. The aim of this study was to provide baseline information to enhance the knowledge on various aspects of the biology of this species. During the years 2003-2009, a total of 59 individuals ofP. kamoharaiwere landed by commercial fishing in Ecuadorian waters. The total length (TL) ranged 50-113 cm. On average, the females were larger than males (91.8 +/- 2.2 and 84.1 +/- 4.1, respectively) and the number of females captured was higher (sex ratio = 1.9F:1M). Based on the morphology of the claspers, males were considered mature at 80 cm TL and at a clasper length of 6 cm, and 70% of the males caught were mature. The squidAncistrocheirus lesueuriwas the only prey observed in two shark stomachs with food from 59 shark stomachs analyzed. This study provides biological information ofP. kamoharaiin Ecuador and will help as a baseline to generate data and increase our knowledge of the biology of this shark species in the eastern Pacific Ocean.","[Estupinan-Montano, Colombo] Fdn Alium Pacific, Carrera 26 5C-13, Santiago De Cali, Colombia; [Galvan-Magana, Felipe] Inst Politecn Nacl, Ctr Interdisciplinario Ciencias Marinas, Av IPN S-N, La Paz 23096, Baja California, Mexico","Estupinan-Montano, C (corresponding author), Fdn Alium Pacific, Carrera 26 5C-13, Santiago De Cali, Colombia.",goliathcem@gmail.com,,"Estupinan-Montano, Colombo/0000-0002-2355-3439",Fundacion Alium Pacific,Fundacion Alium Pacific.,,22,0,0,0,0,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",0212-5919,2366-1674,,THALASSAS,Thalassas,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1007/s41208-020-00251-7,,Aug-20,5,Marine & Freshwater Biology; Oceanography,Marine & Freshwater Biology; Oceanography,NE9SH,WOS:000562943700001,,,,,9/10/20

To characterize the relationship between genome features and biological traits, we sequenced and assembled the genome of the whale shark and compared its genomic and physiological features to those of 83 animals and yeast. We examined the scaling relationships between body size, temperature, metabolic rates, and genomic features and found both general correlations across the animal kingdom and features specific to the whale shark genome. Among animals, increased lifespan is positively correlated to body size and metabolic rate. Several genomic traits also significantly correlated with body size, including intron and gene length. Our large-scale comparative genomic analysis uncovered general features of metazoan genome architecture: Guanine and cytosine (GC) content and codon adaptation index are negatively correlated, and neural connectivity genes are longer than average genes in most genomes. Focusing on the whale shark genome, we identified multiple features that significantly correlate with life-span. Among these were very long gene length, due to introns being highly enriched in repetitive elements such as CR1-like long interspersed nuclear elements, and considerably longer neural genes of several types, including connectivity, activity, and neuro-degeneration genes. The whale shark genome also has the second slowest evolutionary rate observed in vertebrates to date. Our comparative genomics approach uncovered multiple genetic features associated with body size, metabolic rate, and lifespan and showed that the whale shark is a promising model for studies of neural architecture and lifespan.","[Weber, Jessica A.; Church, George M.] Harvard Med Sch, Dept Genet, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Park, Seung Gu; Jeon, Sungwon; Kim, Hak-Min; Jeon, Yeonsu; Bhak, Youngjune; Lee, Semin; Bhak, Jong] Ulsan Natl Inst Sci & Technol, Korean Genom Ctr, Ulsan 44919, South Korea; [Park, Seung Gu; Jeon, Sungwon; Kim, Hak-Min; Jeon, Yeonsu; Bhak, Youngjune; Lee, Semin; Bhak, Jong] Ulsan Natl Inst Sci & Technol, Sch Life Sci, Dept Biomed Engn, Ulsan 44919, South Korea; [Luria, Victor] Harvard Med Sch, Dept Syst Biol, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Jun, Je Hun; Cho, Yun Sung; Bhak, Jong] Clinomics Inc, Ulsan 44919, South Korea; [Kim, Sang Wha] Seoul Natl Univ, Coll Vet Med, Lab Aquat Biomed, Seoul 08826, South Korea; [Kim, Sang Wha] Seoul Natl Univ, Coll Vet Med, Res Inst Vet Sci, Seoul 08826, South Korea; [Hong, Won Hee] Hanwha Marine Biol Res Ctr, Jeju 63642, South Korea; [Karger, Amir] Harvard Med Sch, IT Res Comp, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Cain, John W.] Harvard Univ, Dept Math, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Manica, Andrea] Univ Cambridge, Dept Zool, Cambridge CB2 3EJ, England; [Kim, Soonok] Natl Inst Biol Resources, Incheon 37242, South Korea; [Kim, Jae-Hoon] Jeju Natl Univ, Coll Vet Med, Jeju 63243, South Korea; [Kim, Jae-Hoon] Jeju Natl Univ, Vet Med Res Inst, Jeju 63243, South Korea; [Edwards, Jeremy S.] Univ New Mexico, UNM Comprehens Canc Ctr, Dept Chem & Chem Biol, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA","Church, GM (corresponding author), Harvard Med Sch, Dept Genet, Boston, MA 02115 USA.; Bhak, J (corresponding author), Ulsan Natl Inst Sci & Technol, Korean Genom Ctr, Ulsan 44919, South Korea.; Bhak, J (corresponding author), Ulsan Natl Inst Sci & Technol, Sch Life Sci, Dept Biomed Engn, Ulsan 44919, South Korea.; Bhak, J (corresponding author), Clinomics Inc, Ulsan 44919, South Korea.; Edwards, JS (corresponding author), Univ New Mexico, UNM Comprehens Canc Ctr, Dept Chem & Chem Biol, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA.",jsedwards@salud.unm.edu; jongbhak@genomics.org; gchurch@genetics.med.harvard.edu,,"Bhak, Youngjune/0000-0002-9273-6984; Luria, Victor/0000-0003-0558-0983","Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology (UNIST) [1.180017.01]; UNIST [1.180024.01]; NIHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [R01 HD073104, R01 HD091846]; William Randolph Hearst Fund; Boston Children's Hospital Career Development Fellowship",We thank Dr. Mark Erdmann for generously providing the whale shark photograph used in Fig. 1.

Survey responses of 16,515 Australian metropolitan residents were demarcated to perform analysis across 43 territories, with four football codes analyzed (Australian rules, rugby union, rugby league and soccer). Preferences were evaluated utilizing chi-square tests, with football interest in Sydney found to vary significantly across territorial boundaries. Territories associated with a highly localized team typically exhibited higher interest toward their respective sport, with the inverse found in deterritorialized regions. Although most sport teams have a city based identity, consumer interest can vary widely within such cities. Given that teams typically retain one venue, they must therefore be conscious of maximising their physical availability across a desired population catchment. The findings support the theorized positive relationship between physical product availability and product popularity in a sport setting.","[Fujak, Hunter] Deakin Univ, Sport Management, Burwood, Australia; [Joachim, Greg] Univ Technol, Management, Sydney, NSW, Australia","Fujak, H (corresponding author), Deakin Univ, Sport Management, Burwood, Australia.",h.fujak@deakin.edu.au,,,,,,69,0,0,0,0,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1743-0437,1743-0445,,SPORT SOC,Sport Soc.,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1080/17430437.2020.1807953,,Aug-20,21,"Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism; Sociology",Social Sciences - Other Topics; Sociology,NI5VC,WOS:000565418000001,,,,,9/10/20

Where these artefacts have been found in the Papuan Gulf, only a few have been reported in detail. Here we contribute detailed analyses of eight osseous artefacts from the past village site of Popo which date to within the period 770-220 cal BP. We describe a modified shark tooth, a drilled or pierced dog tooth ornament, several bone points, and a trapezoidal section of modified bone. An ochred bone point shows that people applied pigment to material culture in the period 540-285 cal BP; the item is the only known archaeological evidence for pigment use on bone in the Papuan Gulf.

Understanding the genetic population structure of sharks is key to effective management, maximizing their evolutionary potential in a rapidly changing environment and preventing population declines. Limited dispersal is an important factor promoting population divergence for several coastal shark species. The genetic variation in 14 microsatellite loci and 21,006 single nucleotide polymorphisms genotyped using restriction-site-associated DNA sequencing was analysed to assess the genetic structure of the bonnethead shark,Sphyrna tiburo, in the western North Atlantic. Genetic differences were identified among three well-defined regions: the western Florida coast, the south-eastern US Atlantic coast, and the southern Gulf of Mexico. Results support previous studies based on mitochondrial DNA sequences in defining differences among these regions and suggest limitations of bonnethead sharks in routinely performing long-distance migrations. The limited connectivity among regions explains the pattern of genetic divergence but also reported divergence at the species/subspecies level. These genetically discrete bonnethead populations have independent evolutionary histories that may include local adaptations to specific areas. Bonnethead sharks are currently managed as two stocks in the USA owing to recent genetic, tagging, and life history studies; however, no stock assessments or management plans exist for Mexico. These results not only serve to reinforce US management strategies and provide critical data about the extent of gene flow and sex dispersal among populations, but also begin the process of effective management in the waters of Mexico to ensure the long-term productivity and resilience of this species. With an absence of gene flow between populations from US waters and the southern Gulf of Mexico, there is a need for management plans based upon independent biological and population dynamics data since limited or no opportunities for populations to interchange individuals may occur to re-establish population viability.","[Diaz-Jaimes, Pindaro; Uribe-Alcocer, Manuel] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Ciencias Mar & Limnol, Unidad Acad Ecol & Biodiversidad Acuat, Mexico City, DF, Mexico; [Bayona-Vasquez, Natalia J.; Glenn, Travis C.] Univ Georgia, Dept Environm Hlth Sci, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Bayona-Vasquez, Natalia J.; Glenn, Travis C.] Univ Georgia, Inst Bioinformat, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Escatel-Luna, Elena] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Posgrad Ciencias Mar & Limnol, Mexico City, DF, Mexico; [Pecoraro, Carlo] Physalia Courses, Berlin, Germany; [Adams, Douglas H.] Fish & Wildlife Res Inst, Florida Fish & Wildlife Conservat Commiss, Melbourne, FL USA; [Frazier, Bryan S.] South Carolina Dept Nat Resources, Marine Resources Res Inst, Charleston, SC USA; [Babbucci, Massimiliano] Univ Padua, Dept Comparat Biomed & Food Sci, Legnaro, Italy","Diaz-Jaimes, P (corresponding author), Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Ciencias Mar & Limnol, Apdo Postal 70-305, Mexico City 04510, DF, Mexico.",pindaro@cmarl.unam.mx,,"Adams, Douglas/0000-0002-3539-6629; Glenn, Travis/0000-0001-7725-3637",LANCAD-UNAM-DGTIC [341]; Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia SEP-CONACYT [253381],"LANCAD-UNAM-DGTIC, Grant/Award Number: 341; Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia SEP-CONACYT, Grant/Award Number: 253381",,74,0,0,4,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1052-7613,1099-0755,,AQUAT CONSERV,Aquat.

The bionic ribbed surface of drag reduction inspired from shark skin has been widely used in various parts and achieved good drag reduction effect. However, in the actual processing process, there are situations where the ribbed surface cannot be processed due to the large stepover, while the ribbed surface processed can be damaged due to the small stepover, which ultimately affects the surface quality and surface integrity. Combining the particularity of the structure of the aero-engine blade and the micro-characteristics of the bionic ribbed surface, the relationship between the stepover and the micro-characteristics of belt grinding is established. Experimental detection found that the optimization effectively avoids the situation where the ribbed surface is largely damaged and the ribbed surface will not be processed in some locations. The surface roughness after the optimization is also relatively reduced. The morphology of the optimized surface is consistent, the surface roughness is improved by more than 3%, and the length of the overlapped part of the section is reduced from 0.32 to about 0.12 mm.","[Xiao, Guijian; Zhang, Youdong; He, Yi; He, Shui] Chongqing Univ, State Key Lab Mech Transmiss, 174 Shazhengjie, Chongqing 400044, Peoples R China","Xiao, GJ (corresponding author), Chongqing Univ, State Key Lab Mech Transmiss, 174 Shazhengjie, Chongqing 400044, Peoples R China.",xiaoguijian@cqu.edu.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [51705047, 2017-VII-0002-0095]; Technological Innovation and Application Demonstration of Chongqing [cstc2018jszx-cyzdX0061]","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant no. 51705047), the major projects of aero-engines and gas turbines (2017-VII-0002-0095), and the Technological Innovation and Application Demonstration of Chongqing (cstc2018jszx-cyzdX0061).",,22,0,0,4,4,SPRINGER LONDON LTD,LONDON,"236 GRAYS INN RD, 6TH FLOOR, LONDON WC1X 8HL, ENGLAND",0268-3768,1433-3015,,INT J ADV MANUF TECH,Int.

Public aquaria globally display numerous threatened fish species captured from wild populations. Potential impacts of harvests are rarely evaluated despite the need for improved management and conservation practices. 2. Sawfishes (Family Pristiidae) are one of the world's most at-risk fish families. Most commonly displayed (30+ wild caught individuals) is the Critically Endangered largetooth sawfish,Pristis pristis. 3. Two Australian aquaria release captiveP. prististo the wild as they outgrow displays, intending to offset impacts of the original harvests. The fate of released sawfish is unknown. 4. Using acoustic telemetry, the behaviour (rates of movement, patterns of habitat use) and survival of aquarium released sawfish (n= 5) were compared to a control group of wild sawfish (n= 5). 5. Aquarium sawfish had reduced rates of movement, were more sedentary, and occupied smaller activity spaces than wild sawfish; but diel activity and habitat use patterns were similar. 6. Collectively, mortality was high. Two aquarium sawfish survived to the end of the monitoring period (391 days and 117 days, respectively), and no wild sawfish survived. The mean duration of survival for aquarium and wild sawfish was 157 and 58 days, respectively. 7. Whilst captivity affected behaviours, the lower mortality rates of aquarium sawfish indicates that releases may partially offset the impact of the original harvest. Further data are required to investigate potential long-term ecological impacts. 8. If P. pristis are to be used for aquarium displays, the best conservation outcomes could be achieved by harvesting in the first year of life when natural mortality is highest, followed by release into the freshwater reaches of the natal river where predation risk may be minimized. Size on release should be less than similar to 2,800 mm total length to allow for migration from the river system as part of their natural life cycle.","[Buckley, Kathryn A.; Crook, David A.; Einoder, Luke D.; Kyne, Peter M.] Charles Darwin Univ, Res Inst Environm & Livelihoods, Darwin, NT, Australia; [Pillans, Richard D.] CSIRO Oceans & Atmosphere, St Lucia, Qld, Australia; [Smith, Liam D.

Shark Bay, Australia has some of the best examples of modern microbial mats thriving under harsh conditions of high temperatures, salinity, desiccation, and ultraviolet (UV) radiation. Microorganisms living in extreme ecosystems are thought to potentially encode for secondary metabolites as a survival strategy. Many secondary metabolites are natural products encoded by a grouping of genes known as biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs). Natural products have diverse chemical structures and functions which provide competitive advantages for microorganisms and can also have biotechnology applications. In the present study, the diversity of BGC were described in detail for the first time from Shark Bay microbial mats. A total of 1477 BGCs were detected in metagenomic data over a 20 mm mat depth horizon, with the surface layer possessing over 200 BGCs and containing the highest relative abundance of BGCs of all mat layers. Terpene and bacteriocin BGCs were highly represented and their natural products are proposed to have important roles in ecosystem function in these mat systems. Interestingly, potentially novel BGCs were detected from Heimdallarchaeota and Lokiarchaeota, two evolutionarily significant archaeal phyla not previously known to possess BGCs. This study provides new insights into how secondary metabolites from BGCs may enable diverse microbial mat communities to adapt to extreme environments.","[Chen, Ray; Wong, Hon Lun; Kindler, Gareth S.; MacLeod, Fraser Iain; Benaud, Nicole; Ferrari, Belinda C.; Burns, Brendan P.] Univ New South Wales, Sch Biotechnol & Biomol Sci, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Chen, Ray; Wong, Hon Lun; Kindler, Gareth S.; MacLeod, Fraser Iain; Ferrari, Belinda C.; Burns, Brendan P.] Univ New South Wales, Australian Ctr Astrobiol, Sydney, NSW, Australia","Burns, BP (corresponding author), Univ New South Wales, Sch Biotechnol & Biomol Sci, Sydney, NSW, Australia.; Burns, BP (corresponding author), Univ New South Wales, Australian Ctr Astrobiol, Sydney, NSW, Australia.",brendan.burns@unsw.edu.au,,"Wong, Alan Hon Lun/0000-0002-3801-0410",,,,82,0,0,0,0,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",1664-302X,,,FRONT MICROBIOL,Front.

These deposits are considered part of the Middle Eastern to North African phosphogenic province of the Late Cretaceous-Paleogene age. Petrographic, X-ray diffraction, and scanning electron microscopy with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy analyses were conducted to examine phosphorite samples from Hazm Al-Jalamid. Phosphatic grains were primarily present in the forms of pellets and/or peloids, ooids, coprolites, fish bone fragments (BFs), and shark teeth. Phosphatic minerals were collophane, carbonate fluorapatite, and hydroxylapatite accompanied by non-phosphatic particles of quartz, shell fragments, and clay materials. Phosphatic and non-phosphatic particles were bound together by calcite cement. A systematic microscopic study on phosphorite sediments revealed that the pelletal grains were formed via several diagenetic processes. Most grains were formed through growth around a foreign particle (e.g., fish BFs), phosphomicritization of BFs, fragmentation and abrasion of bone and intraclasts, pelletization of aggregates, and phosphatization and fragmentation of fecal pellets. The depositional environment of Hazm Al-Jalamid phosphorite is characterized by paleo-highs and restricted areas created by local tectonics and low topographic swells and basins within the huge syncline of the Sirhan-Turayf sub-basin. Upwelling marine currents would have provided phosphorus, nutrients, and other elements to this restricted/semi-restricted inner shelf. Notably, the phosphorite beds experienced superficial karstic weathering, and leaching of calcareous cements produced calcite nodules and/or geodes.","[Galmed, Mahmoud Ahmed] King Saud Univ, Coll Sci, Geol & Geophys Dept, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia; [Galmed, Mahmoud Ahmed] Cairo Univ, Geol Dept, Fac Sci, Giza, Egypt; [Nasr, Mahmoud Moselhi] Nucl Mat Author, Cairo, Egypt; [Khater, Ashraf El-Sayed Mohamady] Nucl & Radiol Regulatory Author, Cairo, Egypt","Galmed, MA (corresponding author), King Saud Univ, Coll Sci, Geol & Geophys Dept, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.; Galmed, MA (corresponding author), Cairo Univ, Geol Dept, Fac Sci, Giza, Egypt.",mgalmed@ksu.edu.sa,,,Deanship of Scientific Research at King Saud UniversityKing Saud University [RG-040-1434]; King Saud UniversityKing Saud University,The Deanship of Scientific Research at King Saud University funded this work through research group No. RG-040-1434 and RSSU at King Saud University for their technical support.,,43,0,0,0,0,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1866-7511,1866-7538,,ARAB J GEOSCI,Arab.

To investigate the extent to which oscillatory diving by tiger sharks conform to these patterns, we used a biologging approach to model their cost of transport. High-resolution biologging tags with tri-axial sensors were deployed on 21 tiger sharks at Ningaloo Reef for durations of 5-48 h. Using overall dynamic body acceleration as a proxy for energy expenditure, we modelled the cost of transport of oscillatory movements of varying geometries in both horizontal and vertical planes for tiger sharks. The cost of horizontal transport was minimized by descending at the smallest possible angle and ascending at an angle of 5-14 degrees, meaning that vertical oscillations conserved energy compared to swimming at a level depth. The reduction of vertical travel costs occurred at steeper angles. The absolute dive angles of tiger sharks increased between inshore and offshore zones, presumably to reduce the cost of transport while continuously hunting for prey in both benthic and surface habitats. Oscillatory movements of tiger sharks conform to strategies of cost-efficient foraging, and shallow inshore habitats appear to be an important habitat for both hunting prey and conserving energy while travelling.","[Andrzejaczek, Samantha; Pattiaratchi, Charitha] Univ Western Australia, Oceans Grad Sch, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia; [Andrzejaczek, Samantha; Pattiaratchi, Charitha] Univ Western Australia, UWA Oceans Inst, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia; [Andrzejaczek, Samantha; Meekan, Mark G.] Australian Inst Marine Sci, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia; [Gleiss, Adrian C.; Lear, Karissa O.] Murdoch Univ, Harry Butler Inst, Ctr Sustainable Aquat Ecosyst, Murdoch, WA 6150, Australia; [Chapple, Taylor K.] Oregon State Univ, Coastal Oregon Marine Expt Stn, Newport, OR 97365 USA; [Chapple, Taylor K.] Stanford Univ, Hopkins Marine Stn, Pacific Grove, CA 93950 USA","Andrzejaczek, S (corresponding author), Univ Western Australia, Oceans Grad Sch, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia.; Andrzejaczek, S (corresponding author), Univ Western Australia, UWA Oceans Inst, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia.; Andrzejaczek, S (corresponding author), Australian Inst Marine Sci, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia.",sandrzejaczek@gmail.com,,"Meekan, Mark/0000-0002-3067-9427",Holsworth Wildlife Research Endowment; UWA Graduate Research School fieldwork award; BigWave Productions; Australian Institute of Marine Science,"Fieldwork and tags were funded by crowdfunding on the Experiment platform (doi:10.18258/7190), a Holsworth Wildlife Research Endowment, a UWA Graduate Research School fieldwork award, BigWave Productions and the Australian Institute of Marine Science.",,45,0,0,0,0,ROYAL SOC,LONDON,"6-9 CARLTON HOUSE TERRACE, LONDON SW1Y 5AG, ENGLAND",2054-5703,,,ROY SOC OPEN SCI,R.

Understanding the proportion of time that silky sharks spend associated with floating objects is essential for assessing the impacts of the extensive use of fish aggregating devices (FADs) in the tropical tuna purse-seine fisheries, including increased probability of incidental capture and the potential of an ecological trap. Previous studies provided insight into the amount of time that silky sharks spent at an individual FAD but were unable to assess neither the time spent between two associations nor the proportion of time spent associated/unassociated. The percentage of time that juvenile silky sharks spend unassociated with floating objects was estimated through the analysis of horizontal movements of 26 silky sharks monitored with pop-up archival tags. Under the assumption that a high association rate with drifting FADs would align the trajectories of tracked sharks with ocean surface currents, a novel methodology is proposed, based on the comparison of shark trajectories with simulated trajectories of passively drifting particles derived using a Lagrangian model. Results revealed that silky shark trajectories were divergent from surface currents, and thus unassociated with FADs, for at least 30% of their time. The potential of the methodology and the results are discussed in the context of increasing FAD densities in the Indian Ocean.","[Bonnin, Lucas; Lett, Christophe; Dagorn, Laurent; Forget, Fabien; Verley, Philippe; Capello, Manuela] Univ Montpellier, CNRS, IFREMER, MARBEC,IRD, Sete, France; [Filmalter, John David] South African Inst Aquat Biodivers Marine & Estua, Grahamstown, South Africa","Bonnin, L (corresponding author), Univ Montpellier, CNRS, IFREMER, MARBEC,IRD, Sete, France.",lucasbonnin@hotmail.fr,,"Bonnin, Lucas/0000-0002-5674-1911",research project MADE (Mitigating adverse ecological impacts of open ocean fisheries),research project MADE (Mitigating adverse ecological impacts of open ocean fisheries),,43,0,0,1,1,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1052-7613,1099-0755,,AQUAT CONSERV,Aquat.

However, little is known on the integrated nature of movement behaviours and their relationship to healthy development in this age range. Thus, the objective of this study was to examine the relationships between accelerometer-derived movement behaviours and indicators of physical, cognitive, and social-emotional development using compositional analyses in a sample of preschool-aged children. Methods Children (n = 95) were recruited in Edmonton, Canada. Movement behaviours were measured with ActiGraph wGT3X-BT accelerometers worn 24 hours/day. Physical (i.e., body mass index [BMI] z-scores, percent of adult height, and motor skills), cognitive (i.e., working memory, response inhibition, and vocabulary), and social-emotional (i.e., sociability, externalizing, internalizing, prosocial behaviour, and cognitive, emotional, and behavioural self-regulation) development were assessed. Objective height and weight were measured for BMI z-scores and percent of adult height, while the Test of Gross Motor Development-2 was used to assess motor skills. The Early Years Toolbox was used to assess all cognitive and social-emotional development indicators. Compositional linear regression models and compositional substitution models were conducted in R. Results Children accumulated 11.1 hours of sleep, 6.1 hours of stationary time, 5.1 hours of light-intensity physical activity (LPA), and 1.8 hours of moderate- to vigorous-intensity physical activity (MVPA) per day. Movement behaviour compositions were significantly associated with physical (i.e., locomotor skills, object motor skills, and total motor skills) and cognitive (i.e., working memory and vocabulary) development (R(2)range: 0.11-0.18). In relation to other movement behaviours in the composition, MVPA was positively associated with most physical development outcomes; while stationary time had mixed findings for cognitive development outcomes (i.e., mainly positive associations in linear regressions but non-significant in substitution models). Most associations for LPA and sleep were non-significant. Conclusions The overall composition of movement behaviors appeared important for development. Findings confirmed the importance of MVPA for physical development. Mixed findings between stationary time and cognitive development could indicate this sample engaged in both beneficial (e.g., reading) and detrimental (e.g., screen time) stationary time. However, further research is needed to determine the mechanisms for these relationships.","[Kuzik, Nicholas; Spence, John C.; Carson, Valerie] Univ Alberta, Fac Kinesiol Sport & Recreat, Edmonton, AB, Canada; [Naylor, Path-Jean] Univ Victoria, Sch Exercise Sci Phys & Hlth Educ, Inst Appl Phys Act & Hlth Res, Victoria, BC, Canada","Carson, V (corresponding author), Univ Alberta, Fac Kinesiol Sport & Recreat, Edmonton, AB, Canada.",vlcarson@ualberta.ca,,,,,,34,0,0,0,0,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",1932-6203,,,PLOS ONE,PLoS One,Aug-18,2020,15,8,,,,,,,e0237945,10.1371/journal.pone.0237945,,,16,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,NF7CD,WOS:000563451300009,32810172,"DOAJ Gold, Green Published",,,9/10/20

Catch records and fishing areas of neonates, YOYs, juveniles and adults ofS. lewini(N= 1885) were obtained from calcareous and terrigenous regions in the western Yucatan Peninsula. The results suggest that a nursery for scalloped hammerhead is found in the terrigenous region, characterized by relatively shallow and turbid waters due to rivers' discharges. Neonates and YOYs (96% and 86% of their total records, respectively) were commonly found there over the years in May-August in multiple fishing areas identified by fishers, although mainly between isobaths 10-30 m. The enforcement of management measures is necessary because the nursery is located in a region with intense fishing effort.","[Alejandra Cuevas-Gomez, Gabriela; Carlos Perez-Jimenez, Juan; Mendez-Loeza, Ivan] Colegio Frontera Sur, Dept Ciencias Sustentabilidad, Lerma 24500, Campeche, Mexico; [Carrera-Fernandez, Maribel] Univ Laica Eloy Alfaro Manabi, Fac Ciencias Mar, Dept Cent Invest, Manta, Ecuador; [Leonardo Castillo-Geniz, Jose] Inst Nacl Pesca & Acuacultura, Ctr Reg Invest Pesquera, Ensenada, Baja California, Mexico","Perez-Jimenez, JC (corresponding author), Colegio Frontera Sur, Dept Ciencias Sustentabilidad, Lerma 24500, Campeche, Mexico.",jcperez@ecosur.mx,,"Cuevas, Gabriela Alejandra/0000-0002-9879-0084; Castillo-Geniz, Jose Leonardo/0000-0002-8937-5671; Perez-Jimenez, Juan Carlos/0000-0002-7258-1700; Mendez-Loeza, Ivan/0000-0002-1700-9867",CONACyTConsejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT) [CB-2008-101997-Z]; Environmental Defense Fund (Oceans Programme),"We thank the fishers of the small-scale fleet from Campeche and Tabasco for allowing us to collect catch composition data.

In parallel, and in addition to traditional forensics analysis, we recommend the routine collection of shark DNA from wounds or devices following shark bite incidents in order to genetically identify the individual responsible. This approach would require creating an extensive database of shark identities in high-risk areas against which to compare DNA forensically recovered from shark bite incidents. At a local and regional scale, we propose utilizing existing shark tagging programs and artificial shark aggregation sites to collect DNA, behavioural and morphological data for the database, and to facilitate removal of problem individuals. In several places around the world, selective removal of problem individuals would not be significantly more expensive and definitely less environmentally-destructive than traditional approaches and would also help reconcile people and sharks by underlining individuality in shark behaviour.","[Clua, Eric E.

Although its reproductive behavioral repertoire is already known, including indications that females are not passive to the attempts of males, no indication of proceptive behavior of females of this species is known. Considering that proceptive behavior is what initiates or increases the probability of a male exhibiting sexual behaviors directed at a female, the present study carried out behavioral observations in two groups of nurse sharks in reproductive period to identify possible proceptive behaviors. The present work identified a new behavior, here referred to as Body Movement (BM), as an indicator of proceptivity. This behavior corresponded on average to 47.68% of the reproductive behaviors performed by the females and its occurrence was positively correlated (r = 0.5143341 / p = 0.04152 - Spearman) with the occurrence of socio-reproductive behaviors of males. Being able to identify signs of proceptivity in animals is important to understand the reproductive context in which a group is found and to allow greater attention to animals that are able to reproduce, in order to create more efficient reproductive management programs to develop long-term sustainable population management.","[Colbachini, Helen; Gadig, Otto Bismarck Fazzano] Sao Paulo State Univ, Biosci Inst, Elasmobranch Res Lab, Praca Infante Dom Henr S-N, BR-11330900 Sao Vicente, SP, Brazil; [Colbachini, Helen; Gutierrez, Rafael Caprioli] Aquario Sao Paulo, R Huet Bacelar 407, BR-04275000 Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil; [Pizzutto, Cristiane Schilbach; Jorge-Neto, Pedro Nacib] Univ Sao Paulo, Fac Vet Med & Husb, Dept Anim Reprod, Ave Prof Orlando Marques de Paiva 87, BR-05508010 Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil","Colbachini, H (corresponding author), Aquario Sao Paulo, R Huet Bacelar 407, BR-04275000 Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil.",hcolbachini@gmail.com,"Pizzutto, Cristiane Schilbach/AAP-4802-2020; Neto, Pedro Nacib Jorge/AAB-4324-2019","Pizzutto, Cristiane Schilbach/0000-0002-4357-5133; Neto, Pedro Nacib Jorge/0000-0002-5894-0148",Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior -Brasil (CAPES)CAPES [001],This study was financed in part by the Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior -Brasil (CAPES) -Finance Code 001.,,26,0,0,2,2,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0378-1909,1573-5133,,ENVIRON BIOL FISH,Environ.

Turkish nationally reported fisheries data were compared over a 50-year period from 1967 (the first year data were spatially allocated) to 2016 to assess which species are now extirpated (i.e., earlier present, and now absent from reported catch data), and which species have become commercially extinct (i.e., whose catch declined by 80.0-99.9%). The size of bony fish caught in Turkish waters has also strongly declined. Other important taxa, specifically big sharks and mammals, not covered by fisheries statistics, or currently under protection, but also exhibiting worrisome declining trends, are discussed based on accounts based on peer-reviewed and gray literature and personal accounts from local scientists and fishers. Overall, the Turkish parts of the Black Sea lost 17 extirpated species and 17 commercially extinct marine species, while the Sea of Marmara lost 19 extirpated species and 22 commercially extinct species. This study commemorates the many lost species of the Black and Marmara Seas, and may be seen as a warning call to prevent dozens of others species to be lost.

The economics and finance literatures argue that diversified firms have innovation advantages as their operating units have access to an internal capital market. In contrast, the strategy and entrepreneurship literatures argue that managers of these firms suffer from managerial myopia, discouraging them from investing in projects with long-term, uncertain payoffs. We take a fresh look at the relationship between innovation and diversification using a comprehensive sample of diversified and nondiversified firms and a novel approach that teases out the mechanisms influencing the relationship between diversification and innovation. Consistent with conceptual and empirical work in strategy, we find a robust negative correlation between diversification and R&D intensity, suggesting that diversification reduces innovation by discouraging investment. However, our analysis suggests that internal capital market inefficiencies, rather than managerial myopia, is responsible for this observed negative relationship.","[Klein, Peter G.] Baylor Univ, Hankamer Sch Business, Waco, TX 76798 USA; [Wuebker, Robert] Univ Utah, Dept Entrepreneurship & Strategy, Salt Lake City, UT USA","Klein, PG (corresponding author), Baylor Univ, Hankamer Sch Business, Waco, TX 76798 USA.",peter_klein@baylor.edu,,,,,,84,0,0,0,0,JOHN WILEY & SONS LTD,CHICHESTER,"THE ATRIUM, SOUTHERN GATE, CHICHESTER PO19 8SQ, W SUSSEX, ENGLAND",0143-6570,1099-1468,,MANAG DECIS ECON,Manag.

The increased growth in dolphin-swim businesses has created an industry in Hawaii that earns an estimated $102 million (USD) annually in 2013. Semi-structured interviews with business owners, market research, and boat-based observations provide a platform for estimating revenue generated from dolphin tourism in two popular locations, Waianae, Oahu and Kailua-Kona, Hawaii Island. A revenue analysis of dolphin-swim tourism is presented using a peak season and utilization rate model. These predictions offer an accountability exercise based on a series of assumptions regarding wild dolphin-swim demand and an annual estimate of the number of viewing participants and revenue earned. The results show that dolphin viewing companies are making a larger profit than dolphin-swim businesses by approximately $19 million (USD) per year, however, both avenues are generating large earnings. Sizable differences between businesses in Kona and Waianae are discussed. The average lifetime revenue generated by a dolphin in 2013 is estimated at $3,364,316 (USD) for Waianae and $1,608,882 (USD) for Kona, and is presented as a first step in scenario analysis for policy makers looking to implement management in the bays where tourism occurs.

This scientific knowledge constitutes the basis of the reproductive endocrinology of chondrichthyans, which has provided information regarding their sexual maturation, gametogenesis, mating seasons, gestation periods, and parturition. The present review summarises the existing literature on steroid hormones in chondrichthyan reproduction and identifies future research directions addressing critical knowledge gaps in the reproductive physiology of this taxon. A total of 59 peer reviewed scientific papers from 1963 to 2020 were reviewed and the following parameters analysed: species, steroid hormones, biological matrix, field sampling (year, location), and methodology (assays, sample size, precision, and recoveries). We provided a summary of the methods, biological matrices, and the functions of up to 19 hormones on the biology of 34 species of chondrichthyans that have been analysed to date. The majority of the studies used radioimmunoassay as the main methodology (76.3%; n = 45/49); while the most frequent biological matrix used was plasma (69.5%; n = 41/49). A Kernel's heat map was generated to present the scientific effort according to geographic location and evidenced a lack of research in high biodiversity areas for chondrichthyans worldwide. The implications of the study of steroid hormones for the conservation of chondrichthyans are discussed, as only 2.9% of the species of this group have been analysed and most of the scientific effort (93.2%; n = 55/59 papers) has focused on the analysis of less than six hormones.","[Eduardo Becerril-Garcia, Edgar; Arellano-Martinez, Marcial; Galvan-Magana, Felipe] Inst Politecn Nacl, Ctr Interdisciplinario Ciencias Marinas, La Paz, Mexico; [Bernot-Simon, Daniela] Univ Autonoma Baja California Sur, Dept Acad Ciencias Marinas & Costeras, La Paz, Mexico; [Mauricio Hoyos-Padilla, Edgar] Pelagios Kakunja AC, La Paz, Mexico; [Mauricio Hoyos-Padilla, Edgar] Fins Attached, Colorado Springs, CO USA; [Godard-Codding, Celine] Texas Tech Univ, Inst Environm & Human Hlth, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA","Arellano-Martinez, M (corresponding author), Inst Politecn Nacl, Ctr Interdisciplinario Ciencias Marinas, La Paz, Mexico.",arellano.marcial@gmail.com,,"Hoyos, Edgar/0000-0002-4318-2655","Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (MX); Comision de Operacion y Fomento de Actividades Academicas, Estimulo al Desempeno de los Investigadores (IPN); Sistema Nacional de Investigadores (SNI); Ocean Blue Three and Fins Attached; Texas Tech University","Edgar Eduardo Becerril-Garcia and Daniela Bernot-Simon received a national scholarship from Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (MX).

Central place foragers (CPF) may form groups from which they will predictably disperse to forage, either individually or in smaller groups, before returning to fuse with the larger group. However, the function and stability of social associations in predatory fish acting as CPFs is unknown, as individuals do not need to return to a shelter yet show fidelity to core areas. Using dynamic social networks generated from acoustic tracking data, we document spatially structured sociality in CPF grey reef sharks at a Pacific Ocean atoll. We show that sharks form stable social groups over multiyear periods, with some dyadic associations consistent for up to 4 years. Groups primarily formed during the day, increasing in size throughout the morning before sharks dispersed from the reef at night. Our simulations suggest that multiple individuals sharing a central place and using social information while foraging (i.e. local enhancement) will outperform non-CPF social foragers. We show multiyear social stability in sharks and suggest that social foraging with information transfer could provide a generalizable mechanism for the emergence of sociality with group central place foraging.","[Papastamatiou, Yannis P.] Florida Int Univ, Dept Biol Sci, 3000 NE 151st St, North Miami, FL 33181 USA; [Bodey, Thomas W.] Univ Exeter, Environm & Sustainabil Inst, Penryn Campus, Penryn, Cornwall, England; [Bodey, Thomas W.] Univ Aberdeen, Kings Coll, Sch Biol Sci, Aberdeen, Scotland; [Caselle, Jennifer E.; Bradley, Darcy] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Marine Sci Inst, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Bradley, Darcy] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Bren Sch Environm Sci & Management, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Freeman, Robin; Jacoby, David M.

Many extinct genera and species have been established in the past by the study of fossil rorquals from northern and southern hemispheres. In many cases, the new fossils are used to create new genera. However, in very recent times, new species of known genera have been described that help our understanding of the speciation processes and the biogeography of these whales. Here, a new species of balaenopterid whales is described in order to better understand the past diversity of Balaenopteridae and to analyze its paleobiogeographical implications. As the new species closely resembles a taxon established in the 19th century (i.e., Burtinopsis), a detailed analysis of this taxon was necessary to support the new taxonomic statements of this article. Methods: A new partial skeleton including skull and earbones is described and compared to an extended sample of living and fossil mysticete species. A phylogenetic analysis including 355 character states scored in 88 taxa was performed to understand its relationships within the genus Protororqualus, to allow paleobiogeographic inferences and to better understand the relationships of Protororqualus within Balaenopteridae. Maximum parsimony analyses of character evolution were performed to understand morphological transformations within Balaenopteridae. The revision of Burtinopsis was carried out based on detailed descriptions and comparisons of the type materials that were figured and measured. Results: Protororqualus wilfriedneesi sp. nov. was established based on a comparative analysis of the skull and earbone morphology. The specimen is dated back to the Zanclean (Lower Pliocene, between c. 5.3 and 3.6 Ma). A taphonomical study of the holotype skeleton revealed evidence of interactions with sharks and fishes before the definitive burial of the carcass. Based on the phylogenetic analysis, the monophyly of the genus Protororqualus was confirmed. Protororqualus wilfriedneesi sp. nov. was more derived than Protororqualus cuvieri suggesting that it resulted from an invasion of the North Sea Basin (and the North Atlantic ocean) from the Mediterranean basin. Several specimens from western and eastern sides of the Atlantic Ocean are described that suggest that Protororqualus wilfriedneesi had a trans-Atlantic distribution in the Pliocene.","[Bisconti, Michelangelo] Univ Torino, Dipartimento Sci Terra, Turin, Italy; [Bisconti, Michelangelo] San Diego Nat Hist Museum, Paleobiol Dept, San Diego, CA 92101 USA; [Bosselaers, Mark E.

Here, a single domain shark antibody VNAR fragment (TXB2) with similar affinity to murine and human TfR1 was used to shuttle protein cargo into the brain. TXB2 was fused to a human IgG1 Fc domain (hFc) or to the amyloid-beta (A beta) antibody bapineuzumab (Bapi). TXB2-hFc displayed 20-fold higher brain concentrations compared with a control VNAR-hFc at 18 hours post-injection in wt mice. At the same time point, brain concentrations of Bapi-TXB2 was threefold higher than Bapi. In transgenic mice overexpressing human A beta, the brain-to-blood concentration ratio increased with time due to interaction with intracerebral A beta deposits. The relatively stable threefold difference between Bapi-TXB2 and Bapi was observed for up to 6 days after injection. PET imaging and ex vivo autoradiography revealed more parenchymal distribution of Bapi-TXB2 compared with Bapi. In conclusion, the TXB2 VNAR shuttle markedly increased brain uptake of protein cargo and increased brain concentrations of the A beta binding antibody Bapi.","[Sehlin, Dag; Gustavsson, Tobias; Syvanen, Stina] Uppsala Univ, Dept Publ Hlth & Caring Sci Geriatr, S-75185 Uppsala, Sweden; [Stocki, Pawel; Walsh, Frank S.; Rutkowski, J.

The 1.98-m-long shark exhibited advanced cachexia with its total weight (19.0 kg) and liver weight (0.37 kg) reduced by 60% and 89%, respectively, compared with a healthy individual of the same length. Marked tissue decomposition was evident preventing histopathology and identification of a definitive cause of death. At necropsy, the abdominal organs were abnormally displaced and showed marked reductions in size compared with a healthy individual of the same size. Importantly, a hook-shaped enterolith (HSE), with a rough surface and cream in colour, was found within the spiral valve of the intestine and is to the authors' knowledge, the first description of such in any marine animal. X-ray diffractometry showed that the HSE comprised the minerals monohydrocalcite (Ca[CO3]center dot H2O; similar to 70 wt%) and struvite (Mg [NH4] [PO4]center dot[H2O]6; similar to 30 wt%). A CT scan showed concentric lamellate concretions around a 7/o offset J-hook that formed the nidus of the HSE. Nylon fishing line attached to the hook exited the HSE and was evident in the abdominal cavity through a perforation in the intestinal wall where the posterior intestinal artery merges. The most parsimonious reconstruction of events leading to enterolithiasis and secondary cachexia in this shark was the consumption of a hooked fish and subsequent hook migration causing perforations of the cardiac stomach wall followed by the thin, muscular wall of the apposed, sub-adjacent intestine.","[Otway, Nicholas M.; West, Greg J.] Port Stephens Fisheries Inst, NSW Dept Primary Ind, Taylors Beach, NSW 2316, Australia; [Gore, Damian B.] Macquarie Univ, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Williamson, Jane E.] Macquarie Univ, Dept Biol Sci & MQ Marine, Sydney, NSW, Australia","Otway, NM (corresponding author), Port Stephens Fisheries Inst, NSW Dept Primary Ind, Taylors Beach, NSW 2316, Australia.",nick.otway@dpi.nsw.gov.au,,"West, Greg/0000-0002-7255-0736",Australian and New South Wales governments,This study is part of an ongoing threatened species research programme with funds provided by the Australian and New South Wales governments.,,68,0,0,0,0,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN, NJ 07030 USA",,2053-1095,,VET MED SCI,Vet.

As such, the long-term effects of the provision of bait on shark behaviour are still unclear. Here, we assessed the effects of provisioning using a Control-Impact design on the spatial use and level of residency of the blacktip reef sharkCarcharhinus melanopterusover a 2-year period. We used effect sizes to model the relative changes in residency between provisioning and non-provisioning sites. Sharks showed a high degree of residency and significant changes in their habitat use which persisted overnight while the activity ceased. We suggest that provisioning activities can affect species with high level of residency such as the blacktip reef shark. Further research is needed to better understand how these behavioural modifications can alter the fitness of this species.

There is increasing evidence to show that micro-variations in habitat use may promote coexistence through minimizing direct competition for space and resources. We used two sympatric marine predators that show high fidelity to a small, remote coral atoll as a model to investigate how temporally dynamic partitioning of space use may promote coexistence. Using novel methods (difference network analysis and dynamic space occupancy analysis), we revealed that even though blacktip reef sharks Carcharhinus melanopterus and sicklefin lemon sharks Negaprion acutidens both show focused use of the same atoll habitats, the spatio-temporal dynamics of their use was partitioned such that they only shared the same microhabitats 26% of the time. Moreover, the degree of overlap was strongly influenced by the tidal cycle, peaking at similar to 35% at higher tides as both species appear to target similar intertidal micro-habitats despite the increase in available space. Our work provides a rare example of how two marine predators with similar ecological roles and habitat preferences may coexist in the same place through dynamic segregation of habitat use in space and time, potentially reflecting adaptive behavioral traits for minimizing interactions. The strong influence of small tidal variation on species habitat use and partitioning also raises concerns over how atoll ecosystem dynamics may be influenced by sea level rises that could alter tidal dynamics.","[Lea, James S.

To evaluate the impact that fisheries have on food webs and on the interactions between species, it is necessary to describe and quantify the diet of the species involved and follow it through time. This study compares the diet of five skate species using the data obtained from the by-catch of the Argentine hake (Merluccius hubbsi) fishery in north and central Patagonia, Argentina. Diet composition was assessed by analysing the digestive tract contents and trophic overlapping between species of the genusBathyraja: Bathyraja albomaculata,Bathyraja brachyurops,Bathyraja macloviana,Bathyraja magellanicaandBathyraja multispinis.A total of 184 stomachs were analysed. The diets ofB. albomaculataandB. maclovianamainly comprised annelids, whereas that ofB. brachyuropsprimarily comprised fish, including hake heads discarded by the fishery. The diets ofB. magellanicaandB. multispiniswere largely based on crustaceans. Despite the morphological similarities and their shared preference for benthic habitats, no complete diet overlaps were found between the different species. These results suggest that these skate species have undergone a process of diet specialisation. This is a common feeding strategy that occurs to successfully eliminate competition when resources are limited, which corresponds to the conditions found in an environment being affected by the pressures of overfishing.","[Tschopp, Ayelen; Anibal Garcia, Nestor; Alberto Crespo, Enrique; Alberto Coscarella, Mariano] Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, Ctr Nacl Patagon, Ctr Estudio Sistemas Marinas CESIMAR, CENPAT, Blvd Almirante Brown 2915, RA-9120 Puerto Madryn, Chubut, Argentina; [Cristiani, Franco; Alberto Crespo, Enrique; Alberto Coscarella, Mariano] Univ Nacl Patagonia San Juan Bosco, Fac Ciencias Nat & Ciencias Salud, Dept Biol, Puerto Madryn, Argentina","Coscarella, MA (corresponding author), Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, Ctr Nacl Patagon, Ctr Estudio Sistemas Marinas CESIMAR, CENPAT, Blvd Almirante Brown 2915, RA-9120 Puerto Madryn, Chubut, Argentina.",coscarella@cenpat-conicet.gob.ar,"; Crespo, Enrique/Q-5487-2018","Garcia, Nestor Anibal/0000-0002-3178-7534; Crespo, Enrique/0000-0001-9216-7817",AGENCIA NACIONAL DE PROMOCION CIENTIFICA Y TECNOLOGICAANPCyT [PICT 2110]; CONICETConsejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET); V CONVOCATORIA DE AYUDAS A LA INVESTIGACION EN BIOLOGIA DE LA CONSERVACION DE LA FUNDACION BBVABBVA Foundation [BIOCON_08_-_194/092009-2012],"Financial support was provided by the following projects: (1) AGENCIA NACIONAL DE PROMOCION CIENTIFICA Y TECNOLOGICA. 2016-2018.

Range edge populations are also likely to be better adapted to more extreme conditions for future survival and resilience in warming environments. However, they may also be most at risk of extinction from changing climate. We compare reproductive and genetic data of the temperate seagrass, Posidonia australis on the west coast of Australia. Measures of reproductive effort (flowering and fruit production and seed to ovule ratios) and estimates of genetic diversity and mating patterns (nuclear microsatellite DNA loci) were used to assess sexual reproduction in northern range edge (low latitude, elevated salinities, Shark Bay World Heritage Site) and centre of range (mid-latitude, oceanic salinity, Perth metropolitan waters) meadows in Western Australia. Flower and fruit production were highly variable among meadows and there was no significant relationship between seed to ovule ratio and clonal diversity. However, Shark Bay meadows were two orders of magnitude less fecund than those in Perth metropolitan waters. Shark Bay meadows were characterized by significantly lower levels of genetic diversity and a mixed mating system relative to meadows in Perth metropolitan waters, which had high genetic diversity and a completely outcrossed mating system. The combination of reproductive and genetic data showed overall lower sexual productivity in Shark Bay meadows relative to Perth metropolitan waters. The mixed mating system is likely driven by a combination of local environmental conditions and pollen limitation. These results indicate that seagrass restoration in Shark Bay may benefit from sourcing plant material from multiple reproductive meadows to increase outcrossed pollen availability and seed production for natural recruitment.","[Sinclair, Elizabeth A.; Edgeloe, Jane M.; Anthony, Janet M.; Statton, John; Kendrick, Gary A.] Univ Western Australia, Sch Biol Sci, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia; [Sinclair, Elizabeth A.; Statton, John; Kendrick, Gary A.] Univ Western Australia, Oceans Inst, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia; [Sinclair, Elizabeth A.; Anthony, Janet M.] Kings Pk Sci, Dept Biodivers Conservat & Attract, 1 Kattidj Close, Perth, WA 6005, Australia; [Breed, Martin F.] Flinders Univ S Australia, Coll Sci & Engn, Adelaide, SA 5001, Australia","Sinclair, EA (corresponding author), Univ Western Australia, Sch Biol Sci, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia.; Sinclair, EA (corresponding author), Univ Western Australia, Oceans Inst, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia.; Sinclair, EA (corresponding author), Kings Pk Sci, Dept Biodivers Conservat & Attract, 1 Kattidj Close, Perth, WA 6005, Australia.",esinclair@iinet.net.au,"; Breed, Martin/G-5482-2011","Sinclair, Elizabeth/0000-0002-5789-8945; Breed, Martin/0000-0001-7810-9696","Australian Research CouncilAustralian Research Council [LP130100918, LP160101011, DP180100668]; Friends of Kings Park Summer Scholarship","This project was funded by the Australian Research Council (LP130100918 to G.A.K., LP160101011 to G.A.K., DP180100668 to G.A.K. and M.F.B.).

For this reason, a demographic analysis is necessary to determine the extent of this decline and the fishing effect on the BNC's population. Therefore, we performed a stochastic demographic analysis of the population in the BNC, and considered its global center of abundance. Smalltail shark specimens (n= 937) were collected with gillnets in Maranhao state, eastern BNC, in the 1980s with sizes ranging between 29.6 and 120.0 cm total length. Most of the individuals (90.6%) caught were juveniles (< 6 years-old), and the mortality and exploitation rates showed that the species was overexploited (92.3% above the fishing mortality corresponding to the population equilibrium threshold). The smalltail shark's biological characteristics, such as slow growth and low fecundity, demonstrate that it is one of the least resilient species among similar sized coastal sharks in the region. All these factors yielded an annual decrease of 28% in the intrinsic population growth rate, resulting in a population decline of more than 90% in only 10 years, and much higher for the current period. This set of features comprising fishing recruitment occurring upon juveniles, overfishing, and intrinsically low resilience make the population unable to sustain fishing pressure and severely hamper biological recruitment, thus causing this drastic population decline. Furthermore, several local extinctions for this species in the northeastern and southeastern regions of Brazil highlight its concerning conservation scenario. Therefore, since similar fisheries characteristics occur throughout its distribution range,C.porosusfits the criteria E of the IUCN Red List for a critically endangered species and urgent conservation measures are needed to prevent its extinction in the near future.","[Santana, Francisco Marcante] Univ Fed Rural Pernambuco UFRPE, Unidade Acad Serra Talhada UAST, Lab Dinam Populacoes Aquat DAQUA, Serra Talhada, PE, Brazil; [Santana, Francisco Marcante; Feitosa, Leonardo Manir; Lessa, Rosangela Paula] Univ Fed Rural Pernambuco UFRPE, Dept Pesca & Aquicultura DEPAq, Lab Dinam Populacoes Marinhas DIMAR, Recife, PE, Brazil; [Feitosa, Leonardo Manir; Lessa, Rosangela Paula] Univ Fed Pernambuco UFPE, Programa Posgrad Biol Anim, Recife, PE, Brazil","Santana, FM (corresponding author), Univ Fed Rural Pernambuco UFRPE, Unidade Acad Serra Talhada UAST, Lab Dinam Populacoes Aquat DAQUA, Serra Talhada, PE, Brazil.; Santana, FM (corresponding author), Univ Fed Rural Pernambuco UFRPE, Dept Pesca & Aquicultura DEPAq, Lab Dinam Populacoes Marinhas DIMAR, Recife, PE, Brazil.",framarsantana@yahoo.com.br,,,Secretaria Interministerial para os Recursos do Mar SECIRM; Fundacao de Amparo a Ciencia e Tecnologia do Estado de Pernambuco (FACEPE) [IBPG-0089-2.05/17]; Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico - CNPqNational Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq) [301048/86-OC],The Project Elasmobranchs of Maranhao's Coast was funded by Secretaria Interministerial para os Recursos do Mar SECIRM.

This study examined the effect of several demographic, economic and socioenvironmental factors on the quality of knowledge about and perceptions toward sharks in two contrasting scenarios from northeastern Brazil: a shark hazardous coastal region and a marine protected insular area. Ordered logistic regression models were built using Ukert data collected with a self-administered questionnaire survey (N = 1094). A clear relationship between education, knowledge and perceptions was found, with low education level and knowledge of sharks resulting in more negative perceptions toward these species. Prejudice toward sharks stemmed as a potentially limiting factor because the positive effects of other variables such as affinity for nature and specific knowledge about sharks were superseded by the effects of negative prejudice. Other practical factors such as age, economic level, and gender, also influenced respondent's knowledge and perceptions and could provide a guidance for optimizing socioenvironmental gains relative to public engagement efforts. Results also suggested that populations inhabiting regions with high shark bite incidence likely require distinct outreach methods because some factors underlying knowledge and perception dynamics exhibited structural differences in their effects when compared to the trends observed in a marine protected area. Altogether, public perceptions and attitudes toward sharks could be feasibly enhanced with educational development and nature experiencing strategies. Moreover, disseminating shark-specific knowledge across the society might catalyze support for the conservation of these species in a cost-effective way. This study provides a potentially useful socioenvironmental framework to deal with the human dimensions of shark management and to strengthen conservation policies aimed at promoting societal compliance with pro-environmental values, which is crucial to endow shark populations with effective protection from anthropogenic threats.","[Afonso, Andre S.; Roque, Pedro; Fidelis, Leonardo; Hazin, Fabio H., V] Univ Fed Rural Pernambuco, Dept Pesca & Aquicultura, Recife, PE, Brazil; [Afonso, Andre S.; Conde, Anxo; Maranhao, Paulo; Leandro, Sergio] ESTM Polytech Inst Leiria, MARE Marirn & Environm Sci Ctr, Peniche, Portugal; [Veras, Leonardo] Museu Tubaroes, Fernando De Noronha, Brazil","Afonso, AS (corresponding author), Univ Fed Rural Pernambuco, Dept Pesca & Aquicultura, Recife, PE, Brazil.; Afonso, AS (corresponding author), ESTM Polytech Inst Leiria, MARE Marirn & Environm Sci Ctr, Peniche, Portugal.",afonso.andre@gmail.com,,,"National Geographic Society Conservation TrustNational Geographic Society [C314-15]; Fundacao para a Ciencia e Tecnologia - FCTPortuguese Foundation for Science and Technology [UID/MAR/04292/2013]; Integrated Programme of SR&TD Smart Valorization of Endogenous Marine Biological Resources Under a Changing Climate [Centro-01-0145-FEDER-000018]; Centro 2020 program, Portugal; European Union through the European Regional Development FundEuropean Union (EU)","This research was funded by the National Geographic Society Conservation Trust (ref. #C314-15), Fundacao para a Ciencia e Tecnologia - FCT (ref.

Tropical rivers and estuaries are highly dynamic environments, where environmental conditions change dramatically over spatial and temporal scales. This creates both physiological and ecological challenges for euryhaline elasmobranchs, where fluctuations in salinity can impact not only osmoregulatory function but also the ability to find and acquire prey. 2. We investigated how spatial and temporal variation in environmental salinity influences physiological homoeostasis, habitat utilization and migration timing in two euryhaline carcharhinid sharks within a tropical river in northern Australia. Neonate and juvenile bull sharks Carcharhinus leucas and speartooth sharks Glyphis glyphis were tracked over a 4-year period using implanted acoustic tags and an array of hydrophone receivers. Tissue samples were also collected from captured sharks and analysed for interspecific differences in plasma osmolarity, urea and electrolyte (Na+ and K+) concentrations and the stable isotopes delta C-13 and delta N-15. 3. We discovered that immature C. leucas and G. glyphissegregate spatially along a salinity gradient between September and December, where the mean volume of intersection between species dropped as low as 0.01. While G. glyphis used higher salinity environments (mean salinity = 19.22) located between 30 and 70 km from the mouth of the estuary, C. leucas occupied freshwater reaches (mean salinity = 1.98) between 60 and 110 km upstream. Plasma osmolarities of both species were always hyperosmotic to the environment, with electrolyte concentrations maintained within a narrow range independent of environmental osmolarities. At the onset of the wet season, both C. leucas and G. glyphis undertook a coordinated downstream migration towards the lower estuary before returning upstream. 4. Carcharhinus leucas blood tissues were more enriched in d(15)N and delta C-13 than samples collected from similar sizeG. glyphis, suggesting that these species not only spatially segregate within low salinity habitats but also prey on different dietary resources. Furthermore, a loss of enriched isotopic values in fin tissue with increasing body length provides further support for marine use by adult sharks in conjunction with dependence on rivers as important nursery habitat. Our results illustrate the importance of long-term integrative studies into resource competition and the significance of discrete brackish habitats for threatened euryhaline elasmobranchs.","[Dwyer, Ross G.; Cramp, Rebecca L.; Burke, Colin L.; Lyon, Barry J.; Franklin, Craig E.] Univ Queensland, Sch Biol Sci, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Dwyer, Ross G.] Univ Sunshine Coast, Global Change Ecol Res Grp, Maroochydore, Qld, Australia; [Campbell, Hamish A.; Micheli-Campbell, Mariana A.] Charles Darwin Univ, Coll Engn IT & Environm, Res Inst Environm & Livelihoods, Darwin, NT, Australia; [Pillans, Richard D.] CSIRO Oceans & Atmosphere, St Lucia, Qld, Australia","Dwyer, RG (corresponding author), Univ Queensland, Sch Biol Sci, Brisbane, Qld, Australia.; Dwyer, RG (corresponding author), Univ Sunshine Coast, Global Change Ecol Res Grp, Maroochydore, Qld, Australia.",rdwyer2@usc.edu.au,,"Campbell, Hamish/0000-0003-1428-1686; Dwyer, Ross/0000-0003-1136-5489",Australian Research CouncilAustralian Research Council [LP140100222],"Australian Research Council, Grant/Award Number: LP140100222",,59,0,0,7,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0269-8463,1365-2435,,FUNCT ECOL,Funct.

They rarely reproduce under managed care, with only seven aquaria reporting limited and sporadic success. For the first time in the Americas, a full-term young was born in an aquarium. The young was the result of breeding among a group of sharks purposefully brought together in 2016 for reproduction. Sharks were maintained in natural seawater and exposed to natural light and seasonal temperature fluctuations similar to their in situ counterparts. Decreased food consumption associated with breeding season and gestation was observed. Gestation time estimated from breeding observations and parturition was 321 days. Although the neonate was stillborn, this was a significant achievement. The husbandry details described within will be useful for other aquaria striving to support the reproduction of sand tiger sharks.","[Wyffels, Jennifer] South East Zoo Alliance Reprod & Conservat, Yulee, FL 32097 USA; [Coco, Chris; Schreiber, Chris; Clauss, Tonya] Georgia Aquarium, Atlanta, GA USA; [Palmer, Daniel] Marineland Dolphin Adventure, St Augustine, FL USA; [Bulman, Frank] Ripleys Aquarium Smokies, Gatlinburg, TN USA; [George, Robert; Handsel, Tim] Ripleys Aquarium Myrtle Beach, Myrtle Beach, SC USA; [Pelton, Craig] Univ Florida, Coll Vet Med, Dept Comparat Diagnost & Populat Med, Aquat Anim Hlth Program, Gainesville, FL USA; [Feldheim, Kevin] Field Museum Nat Hist, Pritzker Lab Mol Systemat & Evolut, Chicago, IL 60605 USA","Wyffels, J (corresponding author), South East Zoo Alliance Reprod & Conservat, Yulee, FL 32097 USA.",Jennifer.Wyffels@sezarc.com,,,,,,30,0,0,1,1,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0733-3188,1098-2361,,ZOO BIOL,Zoo Biol.,SEP,2020,39,5,,,,,355,363,,10.1002/zoo.21558,,Aug-20,9,Veterinary Sciences; Zoology,Veterinary Sciences; Zoology,NV0EU,WOS:000555618700001,32757468,,,,9/10/20

Vertical social transmission from parent to offspring [7] is thought to be adaptive because of the parental generation being more skilled than maturing individuals. It is found throughout the animal kingdom, particularly in species with prolonged parental care, e.g., [8, 9]. Social learning can also occur among members of the same generation [4, 10, 11] or between older, non-parental individuals and younger generations [7] via horizontal or oblique transmission, respectively. Extensive work on primate culture has shown that horizontal transmission of foraging behavior is biased toward species with broad cultural repertoires [12] and those with increased levels of social tolerance [13, 14], such as great apes. Vertical social transmission has been established as the primary transmission mechanism of foraging behaviors in the Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops aduncus) population of Shark Bay, Western Australia [6, 9, 15, 16]. Here, we investigated the spread of another foraging strategy, shelling'' [17], whereby some dolphins in this population feed on prey trapped inside large marine gastropod shells. Using a multi-network version of network-based diffusion analysis (NBDA), we show that shelling behavior spreads primarily through non-vertical social transmission. By statistically accounting for both environmental and genetic influences, our findings thus represent the first evidence of non-vertical transmission of a foraging tactic in toothed whales. This research suggests there are multiple transmission pathways of foraging behaviors in dolphins, highlighting the similarities between cetaceans and great apes in the nature of the transmission of cultural behaviors.","[Wild, Sonja; Hoppitt, William J.

Managing bait type offers one tool to control species selectivity. Different species and sizes of marine predators have different prey, and hence bait, preferences. This preference is a function of a bait's chemical, visual, acoustic and textural characteristics and size, and for seabirds the effect on hook sink rate is also important. We conducted a global meta-analysis of existing estimates of the relative risk of capture on different pelagic longline baits. We applied a Bayesian random effects meta-analytic regression modelling approach to estimate overall expected bait-specific catch rates. For blue shark and marine turtles, there were 34% (95% HDI: 4-59%) and 60% (95% HDI: 44-76%) significantly lower relative risks of capture on forage fish bait than squid bait, respectively. Overall estimates of bait-specific relative risk were not significantly different for seven other assessed taxa. The lack of a significant overall estimate of relative capture risk for pelagic shark species combined but significant effect for blue sharks suggests there is species-specific variability in bait-specific catch risk within this group. A qualitative literature review suggests that tunas and istiophorid billfishes may have higher catch rates on squid than fish bait, which conflicts with reducing marine turtle and blue shark catch rates. The findings from this synthesis of quantitative and qualitative evidence support identifying economically viable bycatch management measures with acceptable tradeoffs when multispecies conflicts are unavoidable, and highlight research priorities for global pelagic longline fisheries.","[Gilman, Eric] Pelag Ecosyst Res Collect, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Chaloupka, Milani] Univ Queensland, Ecol Modelling Serv Pty Ltd, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Chaloupka, Milani] Univ Queensland, Marine Spatial Ecol Lab, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Bach, Pascal; Poisson, Francois] Univ Montpellier, IFREMER, CNRS, MARBEC,IRD, Sete, France; [Fennell, Hannah] Heriot Watt Univ, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland; [Hall, Martin] Interamer Trop Tuna Commiss, La Jolla, CA USA; [Musyl, Michael] Pelag Res Grp, Honolulu, HI USA; [Piovano, Susanna] Univ South Pacific, Sch Marine Studies, Suva, Fiji; [Song, Liming] Shanghai Ocean Univ, Shanghai, Peoples R China","Gilman, E (corresponding author), Pelag Ecosyst Res Collect, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA.",FisheriesResearchGroup@gmail.com,,"CHALOUPKA, Milani/0000-0001-8109-005X",Vulcan Inc.; Pew Fellows Program in Marine Conservation at The Pew Charitable Trusts; Safina Center Fellowship Program,"We are grateful to the fisheries scientists who conducted the research and authored the publications compiled and pooled for this meta-analysis.

In this study we address field sampling protocols and estimation methods for robust estimation of mark rate and its uncertainty in cetacean populations. We present two alternatives for estimating the variance of mark rate: (1) a variance estimator for clusters of unequal sizes (SRCS) and (2) a hierarchical Bayesian model (SRCS-Bayes), and compare them to the simple random sampling (SRS) variance estimator. We tested these variance estimators using a simulation to see how they perform at varying mark rates, number of groups sampled, photos per group, and mean group sizes. The hierarchical Bayesian model outperformed the frequentist variance estimators, with the true mark rate of the population held in its 95% HDI 91.9% of the time (compared with coverage of 79% for the SRS method and 76.3% for the SRCS-Cochran method). The simulation results suggest that, ideally, mark rate and its precision should be quantified using hierarchical Bayesian modeling, and researchers should attempt to sample as many unique groups as possible to improve accuracy and precision.","[Wickman, Lindsay; Rayment, William; Dawson, Stephen M.] Univ Otago, Dept Marine Sci, Dunedin, New Zealand; [Slooten, Elisabeth] Univ Otago, Dept Zool, Dunedin, New Zealand","Wickman, L (corresponding author), Univ Otago, Dept Marine Sci, Dunedin, New Zealand.",lindsaymwickman@gmail.com,,,New Zealand Whale and Dolphin Trust; University of Otago,"We are grateful to M.

To develop, implement, and evaluate a co-curricular activity in which second-year Doctor of Pharmacy (PharmD) students developed an idea for a new clinical pharmacy service. Methods. A brief co-curricular activity based on the television series SharkTank was developed to encourage innovation and entrepreneurship. Second-year pharmacy students worked in assigned teams and were allowed one hour to develop an innovative clinical service to solve a pharmacy-related problem. Students then pitched their idea to a panel of four faculty members who served as the sharks and graded the teams using a rubric. The rubric which was employed was mapped to the Center for the Advancement of Pharmacy Education (CAPE) Educational Outcomes. A pre- and post-activity survey was administered to students to gather information about changes in their perceptions of innovation and entrepreneurship in pharmacy. Results. Student groups received higher scores on their ability to present background information and the need for their clinical service and lower scores in areas such as tracking outcomes and predicting challenges. On the post-activity survey, 96.7% of students agreed that the activity gave them a better understanding of pharmacists' roles in establishing new clinical services, and 86.7% stated they intend to actively seek out new clinical pharmacy service opportunities in their future career. Conclusion. Results of the survey demonstrate that students understand the importance of innovation and entrepreneurship in pharmacy practice, and almost all students felt that the activity gave them an even better understanding of the pharmacist's role in clinical service development. This activity can serve as a blueprint for schools of pharmacy looking to incorporate creative and fun methods of exposing PharmD students to innovation and entrepreneurship activities.","[Mogul, Amanda; Laughlin, Elizabeth; Lynch, Sarah] Binghamton Univ, Sch Pharm & Pharmaceut Sci, 96 Corliss Ave, Johnson City, NY 13790 USA","Mogul, A (corresponding author), Binghamton Univ, Sch Pharm & Pharmaceut Sci, 96 Corliss Ave, Johnson City, NY 13790 USA.",amogul@binghamton.edu,,,,,,11,0,0,0,0,AMER ASSOC COLL PHARMACY,ALEXANDRIA,"1426 PRINCE STREET, ALEXANDRIA, VA 22314-2815 USA",0002-9459,1553-6467,,AM J PHARM EDUC,Am.

In this study, the adaptive fuzzy interface system (ANFIS), support vector machines (SVMs), and artificial neural network (ANN) models were employed for predicting the total dissolved solids of aquifers. The moth flam optimization, cat swarm optimization (CSO), particle swarm optimization (PSO), shark algorithm (SA), grey wolf optimization (GWO), and gravitational search algorithm (GSA) were used to train the ANFIS, SVM, and ANN models. The data were collected from Yazd plain (Iran) to predict the Total Dissolved Solids (TDS). The principal component analysis was used to determine the most appropriate inputs for predicting TDS. The hybrid ANFIS-MFO improved the accuracy of RMSE (roo mean square error) over the ANN-MFO and SVM-MFO models by 1.4% and 3.8%, respectively. It was also observed that the SVM model had the least NSE (Nash Sutcliffe efficiency) value among all the models. Unlike the standalone ANFIS, the multilayer perceptron (MLP), and SVMs models, the hybrid ANFIS, ANN, and SVM demonstrated high accuracy in the training and testing phase, so that in the optimal hybrid model, ANFIS-MFO, values of mean absolute error (MAE), Nash Sutcliff efficiency (NSE), and percent bias (PBIAS) were 2.21 (mg/lit), 0.94, 0.15, 2.981 (mg/lit), 0.93, and 0.18, respectively. The ANFIS-MFO was also seen to further enhance the RMSE by approximately 3% and 7%, as compared to the ANN-MFO and SVM-MFO. This study also aims to investigate the temporal variability TDS using innovative trend analysis (ITA). The TDS value of < 1800 (mg/lit) indicates a decreasing trend, while a medium TDS value (2000 mg/lit < TDS < 2800 mg/lit) does not have a significant trend. The high TDS values (TDS > 3000 mg/lit) indicate an increasing trend. In this study, the ANFIS-MFO and ANFIS-CSO models showed superior performance over the other models; hence, indicates significant implication in their application for other water resources and hydrological variables.","[Banadkooki, Fatemeh Barzegari] Payam Noor Univ, Agr Dept, Tehran 3954697, Iran; [Ehteram, Mohammad] Semnan Univ, Fac Civil Engn, Dept Water Engn & Hydraul Struct, Semnan, Iran; [Panahi, Fatemeh] Univ Kashan, Fac Nat Resources & Earth Sci, Kashan, Iran; [Sammen, Saad Sh] Diyala Univ, Coll Engn, Dept Civil Engn, Diyala, Iraq; [Othman, Faridah Binti; EL-Shafie, Ahmed] Univ Malaya, Fac Engn, Civil Engn Dept, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia","Banadkooki, FB (corresponding author), Payam Noor Univ, Agr Dept, Tehran 3954697, Iran.",barzegari@pnu.ac.ir,"El-Shafie, Ahmed/J-1799-2014","El-Shafie, Ahmed/0000-0001-5018-8505; , SAAD/0000-0002-1708-0612","University of MalayaUniversiti Malaya [GPF082A-2018, GPF070A-2018]","The authors appreciate so much the facilities support by the Civil Engineering Department, Faculty of Engineering, University of Malaya, Malaysia, and the financial support received from research grant coded GPF082A-2018 and GPF070A-2018 funded by the University of Malaya.",,67,2,2,0,0,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0022-1694,1879-2707,,J HYDROL,J.

Computational models are powerful tools that has been used for predicting influent time series. But, one of the major drawbacks of developed models is uncertainty analysis in instantaneous and multi-time step prediction of influent time series. For this purpose, a Multi-objective Shark Smell Optimization (MOSSO) algorithm is hybridized with multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural network, radial basis function (RBF) neural networks, and support vector machine (SVM) to optimize the models. These hybrid models of MLP-MOSSO, RBF-MOSSO, and SVM-MOSSO are used for predicting different prediction horizons of immediate, short-term, and long-term of influent time series. Accordingly, there are three objectives in MOSSO: (1) minimize mean absolute error (MAE) in different input vectors for best selection lag time influent time series, (2) achieve the optimal architecture of forecasting models by minimization root mean square error (RMSE) for model parameters, and (3) select accurate activate functions or kernel function of models for finding high accuracy of estimating models. The studied hybrid multi-objective models are modified using Taguchi method for determination of Pareto optimal solution sets. The proposed hybrid models and standalone models of MLP, RBF, and SVM are evaluated using Monte-Carlo uncertainty analysis, common evaluation criteria, and Taylor diagram in evaluation and reliability assessments. The results demonstrated that MLP-MOSSO model produce better results than RBF-MOSSO, SVM-MOSSO, and standalone models in all prediction horizons (S1I4: immediate-Q((t-5min)), Q((t-10min)); S2I16: short term Q((t-12hr)), Q((t-24hr)); S3I15: long term-Q((t-2day)), Q((t-4day))). The MLP-MOSSO model for immediate prediction horizon (Q((t-5min)), Q((t-10min))) with one hidden layer and five neurons in hidden layer, correlation coefficient (R-2) of 0.95, root mean square error (RMSE) of 1.1, Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) of 0.91, RMSE-observations standard deviation ratio (RSR) of 0.14, and percent bias (PBIAS) of 12 for testing phase was chosen as the final and best model for predicting influent time series. Furthermore, it was found that all models have some uncertainties, but the uncertainties in the MLP-MOSSO model with immediate prediction horizon was less than other models for predicting influent time series. Finally based on the optimized results, an explicit equation is derived for the best MLP-MOSSO model to predict multi-step influent time series.","[Seifi, Akram; Soroush, Fatemeh] Vali E Asr Univ Rafsanjan, Coll Agr, Dept Water Sci & Engn, Rafsanjan, Iran; [Ehteram, Mohammad] Semnan Univ, Fac Civil Engn, Dept Water Engn & Hydraul Struct, Semnan, Iran","Seifi, A (corresponding author), Vali E Asr Univ Rafsanjan, Coll Agr, Dept Water Sci & Engn, Rafsanjan, Iran.",a.seifi@vru.ac.ir,,,,,,121,0,0,0,0,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0022-1694,1879-2707,,J HYDROL,J.

As the structure of collagen determines its function, the final objective of this study was to investigate biochemical differences between both collagens to identify future potential applications. Chromatographic behavior revealed differences in collagen from both species. Increases of temperature and stirring time produced no effect on European hake collagen solubility in the mobile phase, resulting in the same chromatographic profiles. Conversely, the application of temperature and stirring-time increments showed a positive effect on Blue shark collagen solubility, resulting in different chromatographic profiles and observing higher molecular weight components when sample is incubated at 50 degrees C (15 min) after 48 h stirring. To test if the different chromatographic behavior exhibited by both collagens could be influenced by differences in subunit composition (alpha-chains), cation exchange chromatography was employed to separate collagen subunits. The electrophoretic patterns and gel permeation chromatography with light-scattering detection (GPC-LS) results of the obtained cation exchange peak fractions revealed differences regarding subunit composition between both species, influencing the crosslinking pattern.

Methods: We supplemented the sparse information on this species by extrapolation from observations on other members of the sleeper shark family and the order Squaliformes. Results and conclusion: The Greenland shark is viviparous and a single observation suggests a litter size of about ten. The gestation period is unknown, but embryos reach a length of around 40 cm at birth. Nutrition is derived from the yolk sac with minimal histotrophy. The surface area of the uterus is increased by villi that presumably increase in length with advancing gestation. These villi are not likely to be secretory but play a key role in the oxygen supply to the embryo. We argue that the ability of the uterus to supply oxygen is a limiting factor for litter size, which is not likely to exceed the small number reported in this and other sleeper sharks.","[Carter, Anthony M.] Univ Southern Denmark, Inst Mol Med, Cardiovasc & Renal Res, Odense, Denmark; [Soma, Hiroaki] Saitama Med Univ, Saitama, Japan","Carter, AM (corresponding author), Univ Southern Denmark, Inst Mol Med, Cardiovasc & Renal Res, Odense, Denmark.",acarter@health.sdu.dk,,,,,,27,0,0,2,2,W B SAUNDERS CO LTD,LONDON,"32 JAMESTOWN RD, LONDON NW1 7BY, ENGLAND",0143-4004,1532-3102,,PLACENTA,Placenta,AUG,2020,97,,,,,,26,28,,10.1016/j.placenta.2020.05.014,,,3,Developmental Biology; Obstetrics & Gynecology; Reproductive Biology,Developmental Biology; Obstetrics & Gynecology; Reproductive Biology,NA6YR,WOS:000559965000004,32792058,,,,9/10/20

In accordance with the biological characteristics and the economic environment of sharks, we extend the Brander-Taylor model of renewable resources and trade to a resource with a continuum of species which are heterogeneous with respect to their growth rate. The model implies that heterogeneity increases the vulnerability of a resource as relatively abundant species make harvesting economically viable even though slow-growing species are driven to extinction. The empirical analysis assesses the fate of sharks in the light of the model and finds that the likelihood of extinction is, indeed, significantly greater for shark species which exhibit low intrinsic growth.

New products were sought after for export by Danish merchants and the peasant farming community responded by increasing the production of the relevant products. The whole period from 1800 to 1850 saw a continuing increase in the exports of sheep products and shark liver oil, which had a common origin in peasant farming production. This period contrasts with the eighteenth century when there was no corresponding growth in exports. The level of exports in the eighteenth century remained overall much the same except during periods of dearth, when it fell. Traditionally the beginning of the modernisation of Icelandic society is dated to around 1880-1910. However, it could be argued that increasing exports of sheep products and shark liver oil after 1800 saw a clear break with the eighteenth-century pattern and that the period should be taken into consideration as being the origin period of economic modernisation in Iceland. This article discusses questions the exclusion not only of the role of peasant farming in the modernisation narrative of Iceland, but also of the Copenhagen merchant houses that organised the goods export from Iceland after 1800.","[Juliusson, Arni Daniel] Univ Iceland, Fac Humanities, Reykjavik, Iceland","Juliusson, AD (corresponding author), Univ Iceland, Fac Humanities, Reykjavik, Iceland.",arnidan@akademia.is,,"Juliusson, Arni Daniel/0000-0003-4518-7801","RANNIS, the Icelandic Research Council; Riksbankens jubileumsfond in Sweden","The writing of this article is partly based on research supported by RANNIS, the Icelandic Research Council, and Riksbankens jubileumsfond in Sweden, in the MYSEAC and ICECHANGE projects.

J,"Heiss, JW",,,,"Heiss, James W.",,,Whale burial and organic matter impacts on biogeochemical cycling in beach aquifers and leachate fluxes to the nearshore zone,JOURNAL OF CONTAMINANT HYDROLOGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Beach aquifer; Biogeochemical processes; Groundwater-surface water interactions; Submarine groundwater discharge; Whale burial,SUBMARINE GROUNDWATER DISCHARGE; SEPTIC-SYSTEM NITRATE; FRESH-WATER; SUBTERRANEAN ESTUARY; SWASH ZONE; SALT-WATER; TRANSPORT; NITROGEN; DYNAMICS; NUTRIENTS,"Coastal managers are increasingly faced with the challenge of disposing of stranded whale carcasses on beaches. Direct burial in the beach is often used as a cost effective method of disposal. However, whale burial management plans are often met with public resistance owing to the perceived risk of shark attraction to burial leachate that may discharge from the seabed. A reactive transport model was combined with a numerical variable-density groundwater flow model to assess buried whale leachate plume formation, transport, influence on beach aquifer reactivity, and discharge to coastal surface water for a range of burial setback distances, depths, and whale sizes. A second set of simulations was performed to evaluate aquifer nitrate removal efficiencies for a range of buried wrack scenarios and to evaluate the role of organic carbon source on beach reactivity. A sensitivity analysis was performed for both sets of models across ten physical and reaction parameters. Simulations using the best estimate parameter set showed that whale burials can produce DOC and ammonium leachate plumes in the beach aquifer that are transported to and discharge near the low tide line in water depths of 0.4-2.4 m. DOC and ammonium concentrations in discharging whale leachate werel.6 and 26 times higher than typical surf zone concentrations, respectively. Of the factors tested, the burial distance inland from the high tide line was the most important factor affecting leachate fluxes to surface water. Burials placed farther inland led to smaller DOC fluxes to surface water, but increased ammonium fluxes. Burial depth also affected whale leachate to the subtidal zone, with deeper burials resulting in smaller fluxes of DOC. Leached DOC from whale decomposition and from buried wrack can fuel denitrification hotspots within beach sediments. The sensitivity analysis showed that nitrate removal supported by buried wrack and whale leachate fluxes are highly dependent on beach properties, hydrologic forcing, and reaction parameters. The wrack model results have implications for beach scraping and the whale burial models show that whale leachate can be delivered to the shallow subtidal zone via groundwater discharge pathways, with potential implications for shark attraction and whale burial management practices.","[Heiss, James W.] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Environm Earth & Atmospher Sci, Lowell, MA 01854 USA; [Heiss, James W.] Univ Massachusetts, One Univ Ave, Lowell, MA 01854 USA","Heiss, JW (corresponding author), Univ Massachusetts, Dept Environm Earth & Atmospher Sci, Lowell, MA 01854 USA.; Heiss, JW (corresponding author), Univ Massachusetts, One Univ Ave, Lowell, MA 01854 USA.",James_Heiss@uml.edu,,,,,,92,0,0,0,0,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0169-7722,1873-6009,,J CONTAM HYDROL,J.

The size of the OB relative to the size of the brain has been positively correlated to a good olfactory capability but, recently, this correlation was questioned after new investigation techniques were developed. Among them, the isotropic fractionator allows to estimate the number of neurons and non-neurons in a given portion of nervous tissue. To date, this technique has been applied in a number of species; in particular the OB was separately analyzed in numerous mammals and in a single crocodile species. Thus, a quantitative description of the OB's cells is available for a small portion of vertebrates. Main aim of this work was to apply isotropic fractionator to investigate the olfactory capability of elasmobranch fishes, whose traditional concept of outstanding olfaction has recently been scaled down by anatomical and physiological studies. For this purpose, the OB of two elasmobranch species, Galeus melastomus and Scyliorhinus canicula, was studied leading to the determination of the number of neurons vs non-neurons in the OB of the specimens. In addition, the obtained cell quantification was related to the olfactory epithelium surface area to obtain a new parameter that encapsulates both information on the peripheral olfactory organ and the OB. The analyzed species resulted in an overall similar quantitative organization of the peripheral olfactory system; slight differences were detected possibly reflecting different environment preference and feeding strategy. Moreover, the non-neurons/neurons ratio of these species, compared to those available in the literature, seems to place elasmobranch fishes among the vertebrate species in which olfaction plays an important role.","[Aicardi, Stefano; Gallus, Lorenzo; Betti, Federico; Ferrando, Sara] Univ Genoa, Dept Earth Environm & Life Sci DISTAV, Corso Europa 26, I-16132 Genoa, Italy; [Amaroli, Andrea] Univ Genoa, Dept Surg Sci & Integrated Diagnost DISC, Largo Rosanna Benzi 8, I-16132 Genoa, Italy; [Amaroli, Andrea] IM Sechenov First Moscow State Med Univ, Dept Orthoped Dent, Inst Dent, Bolshaya Pirogovskaya Ulitsa,19C1, Moscow 119146, Russia; [Di Blasi, Davide; Ghigliotti, Laura; Vacchi, Marino] CNR, Inst Study Anthropogen Impacts & Sustainabil Mari, Natl Res Council, Via De Marini 6, I-16149 Genoa, Italy","Ferrando, S (corresponding author), Univ Genoa, Dept Earth Environm & Life Sci DISTAV, Corso Europa 26, I-16132 Genoa, Italy.",sara.ferrando@unige.it,,"Amaroli, Andrea/0000-0002-0494-7942",University of Genoa,"This work was supported by the University of Genoa, with the Finanziamento per la Ricerca di Ateneo (FRA) 2017 and 2018.",,54,0,0,4,4,ELSEVIER GMBH,MUNICH,"HACKERBRUCKE 6, 80335 MUNICH, GERMANY",0944-2006,,,ZOOLOGY,Zoology,AUG,2020,141,,,,,,,,125796,10.1016/j.zool.2020.125796,,,12,Zoology,Zoology,MW7NM,WOS:000557218500005,32464514,,,,9/10/20

Conservation measures such as area closures and fisheries prohibitions have been put in place to support the recovery of vulnerable species. However, the effectiveness of such measures is rarely evaluated in the context of other factors that may affect population abundance. This study investigates the effectiveness of management measures using 1) General additive mixed model derivative changes, taking into account environmental factors that may affect population stochasticity and 2) an age-structured density dependent population dynamic model. The Raja undulata (undulate ray) 2009 targeted fisheries prohibition was used as a case study. Potential beneficial responses on sympatric species Raja clavata (thornback ray) were modelled. A significant increase in abundance was observed in both IUCN red list species during the ban. Surface seawater temperature had a marginal effect on the abundance of both species. The prohibition was in place for an insufficient length of time for long lasting effects to be detected on skate length. The population dynamic model indicated that the increase in abundance was only possible when combining the fisheries ban with increased juvenile discard survival. Our results indicate that species conservation measures may not only have positive effects on the species in question, but also on species with a niche overlap. Nonetheless, due to ongoing fishing for other species, the full potential of fisheries prohibitions may not be realised. For real benefits to be assessed, evaluation of bans should take place once a steady state is observed.","[Elliott, Sophie A.

The long-term influence of hurricane sediment inputs on soil elevation dynamics in mangrove forests is not well understood. Here, we assessed the effects of sediment deposition during Hurricanes Wilma (2005) and Irma (2017) on soil elevation change at two mangrove forests located along the Shark and Lostmans Rivers in Everglades National Park. We used surface elevation change data from a 16-year period (2002-2018), measured with the surface elevation table-marker horizon (SET-MH) approach. At the Shark River mangrove forest, we used marker horizons and a combination of deep, shallow, and original SETs to quantify the contributions of four soil zones to net soil elevation change. Rates of elevation change were greatly influenced by storm sediments. Abrupt increases in elevation due to sediment inputs and subsurface expansion during Hurricane Wilma were followed by: (1) an initial post-hurricane period of elevation loss due to erosion of hurricane sediments and subsurface contraction; (2) a secondary period of elevation gain due primarily to accretion; and (3) an abrupt elevation gain due to new sediment inputs during Hurricane Irma. Our findings suggest that elevation change in hurricane-affected mangrove forests can be cyclical or include disjunct phases, which is critical information for advancing the understanding of wetland responses to accelerated sea-level rise given the expectation of increasing storm intensity due to climate change.","[Feher, Laura C.; Osland, Michael J.; Vervaeke, William C.; Krauss, Ken W.] US Geol Survey, Wetland & Aquat Res Ctr, 700 Cajundome Blvd, Lafayette, LA 70506 USA; [Anderson, Gordon H.; Smith, Thomas J., III] US Geol Survey, Wetland & Aquat Res Ctr, Gainesville, FL 32653 USA; [Whelan, Kevin R.

These unconventional TCR are consistent with a scenario in which TCR and BCR, although having diverged from each other more than 400 million years ago, continue to exchange variable gene segments in generating diversity for Ag recognition. However, the process underlying this exchange and leading to the evolution of these atypical TCR receptor genes remains elusive. In this study, we identified two TCR alpha/delta gene loci in the Chinese alligator (Alligator sinensis). In total, there were 144 V, 154 J alpha, nine J delta, eight D delta, two C alpha, and five C delta gene segments in the TCR alpha/delta loci of the Chinese alligator, representing the most complicated TCR alpha/delta gene system in both genomic structure and gene content in any tetrapod examined so far. A pool of 32 VH delta genes divided into 18 subfamilies was found to be scattered over the two loci. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that these VH delta genes could be related to bird VH delta genes, VH delta/V mu genes in platypus or opossum, or alligator VH genes. Based on these findings, a model explaining the evolutionary pattern of atypical TCR delta/TCR mu genes in tetrapods is proposed. This study sheds new light on the evolution of TCR and BCR genes, two of the most essential components of adaptive immunity.","[Wang, Xifeng; Zhou, Xin] China Agr Univ, Coll Plant Protect, Beijing Adv Innovat Ctr Food Nutr & Human Hlth, 2 Yuanmingyuan Western Rd, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China; [Huang, Jinwei; Wang, Peng; Yu, Di; Ke, Cuncun; Song, Yu; Bai, Jianhui; Li, Kongpan; Ren, Liming; Han, Haitang; Zhao, Yaofeng] China Agr Univ, Coll Biol Sci, State Key Lab Agrobiotechnol, Natl Engn Lab Anim Breeding, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China; [Wang, Renping; Wang, Chaolin] Adm Bur Alligator Sinensis Natl Nat Reserve Prote, Xuancheng 242000, Anhui, Peoples R China; [Huang, Tian] Henan Univ, Sch Life Sci, Henan Engn Lab Mammary Bioreactor, Kaifeng 475004, Henan, Peoples R China; [Miller, Robert D.] Univ New Mexico, Ctr Evolutionary & Theoret Immunol, Dept Biol, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA","Zhou, X (corresponding author), China Agr Univ, Coll Plant Protect, Beijing Adv Innovat Ctr Food Nutr & Human Hlth, 2 Yuanmingyuan Western Rd, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China.; Han, HT; Zhao, YF (corresponding author), China Agr Univ, Coll Biol Sci, State Key Lab Agrobiotechnol, 2 Yuanmingyuan Western Rd, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China.",hanhaitang@cau.edu.cn; xinzhou@cau.edu.cn; yaofengzhao@cau.edu.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [31472085, 31772589]; Program of Introducing Talents of Discipline to Universities, Plan 111 [B12008]; Beijing Advanced Innovation Center for Food Nutrition and Human Health, China Agricultural University; National Institute of General Medical Sciences of the National Institutes of Health Award [P30 GM110907]; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [IOS-13531232]","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (31472085 and 31772589), the Program of Introducing Talents of Discipline to Universities, Plan 111 (B12008), and funding from the Beijing Advanced Innovation Center for Food Nutrition and Human Health, China Agricultural University.

Therefore, we may conclude that the Okumura-Aprile technique is efficient in shark dental diaphonization.","[Pech, Genesis Ariadna Gutierrez; Fabila, GabrielaSanchez; Moreno Colin, Roberto] UNAM, Fac Estudios Super Iztacala, Lab Anat Vertebrados & Educ Cient, Tlalnepantla De Baz, Mexico; [Del Moral Flores, Luis Fernando] UNAM, Fac Estudios Super Iztacala, Lab Zool, Tlalnepantla De Baz, Mexico; [Trinidad, Iris de los Angeles Rodriguez; Salazar, Francisco Torres] UNAM, Fac Estudios Super Iztacala, Lab Estomatol & Patol Oral, Tlalnepantla De Baz, Mexico","Fabila, G (corresponding author), UNAM, Fac Estudios Super Iztacala, Lab Anat Vertebrados & Educ Cient, Tlalnepantla De Baz, Mexico.",gsfabila@gmail.com,,,,,,12,0,0,0,0,SOC CHILENA ANATOMIA,TEMUCO,"CASILLA 54-D, TEMUCO, 00000, CHILE",0717-9502,0717-9367,,INT J MORPHOL,Int.

Fins from all species frequently exceed Hg limits established by HK authorities. Most of the mercury found is in the form of methyl-mercury (69.0 +/- 33.5%). Five species surpass methyl-mercury PTWIs and blue shark fins can exceed inorganic arsenic BMDL0.5. Species-of-origin was a significant predictor of heavy metal concentrations, with higher mercury concentrations associated with coastal sharks and lower arsenic levels found with increasing shark trophic level.

The species with the highest vulnerability scores were caught mainly by longline and gillnet fisheries, highlighting the need for improved data collection to facilitate a more detailed investigation using more quantitative methods. The data quality analysis indicated that the quality of data was classified as moderate for economically important species.

Although the Southern Ocean is often portrayed as a pristine ecosystem, its fishery products are not immune to mercury contamination. We analysed mercury concentration (organic and inorganic forms - T-Hg) in the muscle of Antarctic toothfish, Dissostichus mawsoni, a long-lived top predator which supports a highly profitable fishery. Our samples were collected in three fishing areas (one seamount and two on the continental slope) in the Southwest Pacific Sector of the Southern Ocean during the 2016/2017 fishing season. Mercury levels and the size range of fish varied between fishing areas, with the highest levels (0.68 +/- 0.45 mg kg(-1) wwt) occurring on the Amundsen Sea seamount where catches were dominated by larger, older fish. The most parsimonious model of mercury concentration included both age and habitat (seamount vs continental slope) as explanatory variables. Mean mercury levels for each fishing area were higher than those in all previous studies of D. mawsoni, with mean values for the Amundsen Sea seamount exceeding the 0.5 mg kg(-1) food safety threshold for the first time. It might therefore be appropriate to add D. mawsoni to the list of taxa, such as swordfish and sharks, which are known to exceed this threshold. This apparent increase in mercury levels suggests a recent contamination event which affected the Southwest Pacific sector, including both the Amundsen and Dumont D'Urville seas.","[Queiros, Jose P.; Ramos, Jaime A.; Xavier, Jose C.] Univ Coimbra, MARE Marine & Environm Sci Ctr, Dept Life Sci, P-3000456 Coimbra, Portugal; [Hill, Simeon L.; Xavier, Jose C.] NERC, British Antarctic Survey, Madingley Rd, Cambridge CB3 0ET, England; [Pinkerton, Matt; Stevens, Darren W.] NIWA Natl Inst Water & Atmospher Res, 301 Evans Bay Parade, Wellington 6021, New Zealand; [Vacchi, Marino] CNR Genova, ISMAR Inst Marine Sci, I-16149 Genoa, Italy; [Coelho, Joao P.; Seco, Jose] Univ Aveiro, Dept Biol, Campus Univ Santiago, P-3810193 Aveiro, Portugal; [Coelho, Joao P.; Pereira, Eduarda; Seco, Jose] Univ Aveiro, CESAM, Campus Univ Santiago, P-3810193 Aveiro, Portugal; [Pereira, Eduarda] Univ Aveiro, Dept Quim, Campus Univ Santiago, P-3810193 Aveiro, Portugal; [Seco, Jose] Univ St Andrews, Sch Biol, St Andrews KY16 9ST, Fife, Scotland","Queiros, JP (corresponding author), Univ Coimbra, MARE Marine & Environm Sci Ctr, Dept Life Sci, P-3000456 Coimbra, Portugal.",josequeiros@ua.pt,"Coelho, Joao Pedro/C-1699-2008; Seco, Jose/AAS-4612-2020","Coelho, Joao Pedro/0000-0003-1975-8308; Seco, Jose/0000-0002-7957-6488; Queiros, Jose Pedro/0000-0003-2763-2529",FCT/MCTES through national funds (PIDDAC); Portuguese Polar Program (PROPOLAR); SCAR Ant-ERA; FCT-PortugalPortuguese Foundation for Science and Technology [SRFH/PD/BD113487]; CESAM [UID/AMB/50017/2019]; Integrated Program of SR&TD 'Smart Valorization of Endogenous Marine Biological Resources Under a Changing Climate' [Centro-01-0145-FEDER-000018]; Centro 2020 program; Portugal 2020; European Regional Development FundEuropean Union (EU),"Jose Queiros was supported by FCT/MCTES through national funds (PIDDAC) and Portuguese Polar Program (PROPOLAR).

While this industry can provide community and conservation benefits, it presents risks to target species, environments and humans when inappropriately managed. To ensure appropriate management is implemented, there is a need to identify the prevalence of elasmobranch tourism globally, the types of operations occurring and the controls used to mitigate risk. This study undertook a global literature review to develop an industry activity typology and establish the types of management controls present across elasmobranch tourism operations. In total, 151 unique species-activity-location conditions were identified, with four broad activity types categorised: diving, snorkelling, provisioning and cage diving. Spanning 42 countries and 49 different species, 32% of conditions identified lacked evidence of management. Further to this, many of the prevailing management controls in place (e.g. MPAs, shark sanctuaries, protected species status), were secondary in nature, having not been designed or implemented to manage elasmobranch tourism explicitly. Therefore, avoidable risks are likely widespread throughout the industry. Encouragingly, the application of activity specific management controls is likely to be effective at reducing risks across activity types. The theoretical case studies and management tools investigated herein provide operators and industry managers with guidance on how to reduce risk and safeguard industry benefits. With the elasmobranch tourism industry likely to continue expanding, it is important that appropriate management and regulatory frameworks are in place so that marine wildlife tourism can continue in a beneficial and sustainable manner.","[Healy, Teleah Joy; Barnett, Adam; Chin, Andrew] James Cook Univ, Ctr Sustainable Fisheries & Aquaculture, Townsville, Qld, Australia; [Healy, Teleah Joy; Barnett, Adam; Chin, Andrew] James Cook Univ, Coll Sci & Engn, Townsville, Qld, Australia; [Hill, Nicholas James] Univ Tasmania, Inst Marine & Antarctic Studies, Private Bag 49, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia","Healy, TJ (corresponding author), 11A Quamby Ave, Sandy Bay, Tas 7005, Australia.",Teleah.healy@gmail.com,,,,,,74,0,0,5,5,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-597X,1872-9460,,MAR POLICY,Mar.

However, constructive debate around shark issues has been stymied by the many stakeholders with conflicting or unclear objectives: Government Agencies with multiple objectives (sustainable management, conservation, public safety); fishers (commercial and recreational) that target certain species of sharks, or try to avoid interactions; tourism operators; indigenous peoples with cultural links; conservation groups; other ocean-users and members of the general public who may be shark-conservationists or shark-cull advocates. The confusion appears partly due to various stakeholder groups using the collective noun 'sharks' when discussing issues. The use of 'sharks' confuses debates in a way similar to other totemic taxa (e.g. whales) where unique attributes of multiple species have been combined. In the case of 'sharks' the situation is exacerbated by the large number of species (globally >500), the diversity of values attributed to species and the ability of stakeholders to have multiple values (e.g. fishers who regard sharks as desirable target species and as depredators of target species). We argue that 'sharks' extend the super-species concept, reducing clarity and hindering the development of more broadly acceptable policies. To improve this discourse we suggest that stakeholders define 'sharks' in discussions and reports with species-by-area descriptors (e.g. white-sharks in Western Australia); or as a minimum, on a defined group-by-area basis (e.g. sharks that support eco-tourism in South Africa; commercially important species of sharks in southern Australia), so the species in focus is (are) clearly defined, allowing future debates to be more constructive and support the development of more widely-acceptable policies.","[Molony, Brett W.; Thomson, Damian P.] Univ Western Australia, Indian Ocean Marine Res Ctr, CSIRO Oceans & Atmosphere, M097,35 Stirling Highway, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia","Molony, BW (corresponding author), Univ Western Australia, Indian Ocean Marine Res Ctr, CSIRO Oceans & Atmosphere, M097,35 Stirling Highway, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia.",Brett.Molony@csiro.au,,"Molony, Brett/0000-0002-6143-3462; Thomson, Damian/0000-0001-5485-1562",CSIRO Oceans Atmosphere,This work was funded by CSIRO Oceans & Atmosphere.,,77,0,0,6,6,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-597X,1872-9460,,MAR POLICY,Mar.

Here we present a record of calcium isotopic composition and [Sr] of seawater over the last 100 million years using measurements from modern and fossil shark teeth. Although there is significant variability in modern elasmobranch tooth enamel associated with physiology and diet, our record suggests a first-order increase in the average calcium isotopic composition of seawater by 0.5 parts per thousand and a decline in Sr/Ca ratios of similar to 40% over the last 100 million years. These observations are in agreement with trends seen in other archives. We propose that the observed changes in both the calcium isotopic composition and Sr concentration of seawater can be explained by changes in the partitioning of the global carbonate sink associated with the development of a deep-sea carbonate reservoir in the mid-Mesozoic.

In this sense, several studies have revealed a high percentage of fraud for species substitution both at retail and food service level worldwide including European Union. Spain is one of the European countries with the highest consumption of fisheries and aquaculture products and it is therefore a very interesting region to evaluate the impact of seafood fraud in food services. The study presented in this paper is the first large-scale attempt to study the rate of seafood fraud in food services across Spain. A total of 313 samples were collected in 204 mass caterer outlets from 15 Spanish Autonomous Communities and successfully sequenced. DNA barcoding revealed that 50 % of the food services establishments sold mislabeled seafood. Dusky grouper and tope shark showed the highest mislabelling percentages ranging from 86 to 100 %. Overall results evidence the complexity of international seafood supply chains supported by the fact that many of the species reported substituting local species, are coming from Asian, South American and South African regions.","[Angel Pardo, Miguel; Jimenez, Elisa] AZTI Parque Tecnol Bizkaia, Food Res Div, Astondo Bidea 609, Derio 48160, Bizkaia, Spain","Pardo, MA (corresponding author), AZTI Parque Tecnol Bizkaia, Food Res Div, Astondo Bidea 609, Derio 48160, Bizkaia, Spain.",mpardo@azti.es,,,"European Union Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013) [613688]; Department of Food, Fisheries and Agriculture from the Basque Government; SEA-TRACES INTERREG Atlantic Area EU [EAPA_87/2016]","This study has received funding from the European Union Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013) under grant agreement no (613688), from the Department of Food, Fisheries and Agriculture from the Basque Government and the SEA-TRACES (EAPA_87/2016) INTERREG Atlantic Area EU funded project.",,38,0,0,4,4,ACADEMIC PRESS INC ELSEVIER SCIENCE,SAN DIEGO,"525 B ST, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA",0889-1575,1096-0481,,J FOOD COMPOS ANAL,J.

The sandwich-type structure in cross section of the jaw based on alternate layers with prevalence in organic tissue or mineralized is shown and these bands respectively confirmed as CS or hydroxyapatite -enriched zones. As result of this, an optimized process in sequential steps for the recovery of both biomaterials and their purification process is proposed, by combining enzymatic proteolysis, chemical precipitation and separation using ultrafiltration membrane for CS production together with controlled thermal treatment for hydroxyapatite obtaining. The purified CS was characterized by Gel Permeation Chromatography, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance and Strong Anion Exchange Chromatography, revealing a polymeric material with a molecular weight of 67 kDa, and prevalent 6S-GalNAc sulfation (68%), followed by 4S-GalNAc (13%), a significant proportion of disulfated disaccharides (12%) and only 7% of non-sulfated units. In the case of the bioapatite a purified biphasic 60:40 porous calcium phosphate of hydroxyapatite: whitlockite/beta-TCP was confirmed. Hydroxyapatite as major component (85%) was also obtained for jaws directly subjected to the thermal treatment. This proved the influence of the enzymatic hydrolysis and centrifugation on the composition of the mineral fraction. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Since MRAP1 affects the ligand sensitivity of MC2R orthologs, this study tested the hypothesis that co-expression of MC5R with MRAP1 would also affect the ligand sensitivity of MC5R. The hypothesis was confirmed for stingray, rainbow trout, and chicken, MC5R orthologs. However, elephant shark MC5R was not affected in the same way by coexpression of MRAP1. It appears that, for some MC5R orthologs (i.e., stingray, rainbow trout, and chicken), a docking site for the R/KKRRP motif of ACTH(1-24) may become exposed on the receptor following co-expression with MRAP1. However, for elephant shark MC5R co-expression with MRAP1 may not affect engagement ACTH(1-24).

Receptors of these hormones, respectively the melatonin receptors and the melanocortin receptors, are all members of the G-protein coupled receptor family i.e. coupled with specific G proteins involved in the preliminary steps of their transduction pathways. The present study highlights the specific localization of the hormonal receptors, as well as of their associated G-proteins within the light organs, the so-called photophores, in E. spinax and E. molleri through immunohistofluorescence technic.

Marine protected areas (MPAs) have thus become an indispensable tool for the protection of these marine predators. Two recently-created MPAs in the Northeast Pacific Ocean, the Revillagigedo National Park and Clipperton Atoll, are characterized by different trophic structures potentially influencing the trophic niche and contaminant exposure of resident sharks in these two sites. In this context, we used carbon (delta C-13) and nitrogen (delta N-15) stable isotope analyzes as well as total mercury concentrations ([THg]) to assess the effect of foraging site on the trophic niche and Hg levels of juvenile silvertip (ST) sharks Carcharhinus albimarginatus. Analyzing fin clip samples from Revillagigedo and Clipperton, we found that shark delta N-15 varied spatially in relation to delta N-15 baselines, suggesting similar trophic position in both MPAs. Moreover, delta C-13 values indicated that ST sharks from Revillagigedo would feed on different food webs (i.e. both benthic and pelagic) while individuals from Clipperton would only rely on benthic food webs. These differences between MPAs led to a weak overlap of isotopic niches between the two populations, highlighting the site residency of juvenile ST sharks. Within each population, [THg] was not correlated with trophic tracers (delta N-15 and delta C-13) and was also similar between populations. This study revealed no influence of site or food web in [THg] and raises the question of the origin of Hg exposure for reef shark populations in the Northeast Pacific Ocean. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

An understanding of both species ecology and fisher behaviour are therefore fundamental for effective fisheries management. In Europe, Rajidae are commercially fished species that are vulnerable to overfishing, have historically been grouped in landings data and declines have been reported to the point of local extinction in some species. Management of these species is therefore important, however an understanding of species ecology and the way they interact with the fishery is lacking. Here we investigate how the differing ecology of four species affects interactions with the fishery by considering gear types, Marine Protected Areas, location of capture and geographic displacements. Our results demonstrate that the four species interacted differently with the fishery, for example Raja clavata were more commonly captured by static nets (69 % of recaptures) and Raja brachyura more commonly by trawlers (77 %). There were clear differences in the location of capture, depths and displacements of the four species resulting in differing interactions with existing management in the form of Marine Protected Areas. For example 53 % of R. clavata recaptures were within the boundaries of an MPA compared to 18 % for R. brachyura. These results provide important differences among species that are generally grouped by current management, emphasising the need for further species specific research to ensure effective management.","[Simpson, Samantha J.; Humphries, Nicolas E.; Sims, David W.] Marine Biol Assoc UK, Citadel Hill, Plymouth PL1 2PB, Devon, England; [Simpson, Samantha J.; Sims, David W.] Univ Southampton, Natl Oceanog Ctr Southampton, Ocean & Earth Sci, Waterfront Campus,European Way, Southampton SO14 3ZH, Hants, England; [Sims, David W.] Univ Southampton, Ctr Biol Sci, Bldg 85,Highfield Campus, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England","Simpson, SJ (corresponding author), Marine Biol Assoc UK, Citadel Hill, Plymouth PL1 2PB, Devon, England.",s.simpson@bangor.ac.uk,,,University of Southampton SPITFIRE Doctoral Training Partnership PhD studentship - Natural Environmental Research Council [NE/L002531/1]; Marine Biological Association of the UK (MBA); MBA Senior Research Fellowship,"S.J.S was supported by the University of Southampton SPITFIRE Doctoral Training Partnership PhD studentship, funded jointly by the Natural Environmental Research Council (Grant No. NE/L002531/1) and the Marine Biological Association of the UK (MBA).

Using polar bear tourism as a case study, content analysis of TripAdvisor reviews from Churchill (Canada) and Svalbard (Norway) was used to examine participants' comments on unpredictable wildlife and reactions when polar bears were not found. Findings indicate that to keep participants satisfied, wildlife watching tourism providers should focus on more controllable parts of the experience, such as high-quality guiding, expectations management, and secondary, more guaranteed side activities.

Whilst melanoma most commonly affects the skin, it can also arise in mucosal surfaces, the eye, and the brain. For new therapies to be developed, a better understanding of the genetic landscape, signalling pathways, and tumour-microenvironmental interactions is needed. This is where animal models are of critical importance. The mouse is the foremost used model of human melanoma. Arguably this is due to its plethora of benefits as a laboratory animal; however, it is important to note that unlike humans, melanocytes are not present at the dermal-epidermal junction in mice and mice do not develop melanoma without genetic manipulation. In contrast, there are numerous reports of animals that spontaneously develop melanoma, ranging from sharks and parrots to hippos and monkeys. In addition, several domesticated and laboratory-bred animals spontaneously develop melanoma or UV-induced melanoma, specifically, fish, opossums, pigs, horses, cats, and dogs. In this review, we look at spontaneously occurring animal 'models' of melanoma and discuss their relevance to the different types of melanoma found in humans. (c) 2020 The Authors.

For instance, reef shark species are thought to benefit from marine protected area networks, even though their movement behaviour remains poorly characterized. Poor understanding of species' movements implies that the benefits of MPA networks for species' populations are still widely unknown. To understand the consequences of movement behaviour for protection, we modelled movements of three reef shark species' (Carcharhinus albimarginatus,C. amblyrhynchosandC. leucas) with distinct levels of reef association using real passive-acoustic telemetry data. The model simulates if individuals are protected or unprotected by their movements in a system of reef patches in a network of MPAs. Model parameters that control individuals' movements were estimated from acoustic telemetry data. To estimate benefits for species we monitored longevity and time spent in protected habitats across all scenarios of reef protection, fishing intensity (11 values for each) and protection of high or low suitability reefs (a reef-dependent factor that attracts sharks to reside in it) for populations of 1,000 individuals per species. The time individuals spent in protected reefs increased linearly with protection until it levelled off after 50%-80% of reefs protected (78%C. amblyrhynchos, 72%C. albimarginatusand 52% C. leucas, at 100% protection). Individuals' life span decreased exponentially with fishing intensity. Reef protection only mildly counteracted life span lost to fishing. Protecting highly suitable reefs increased time spent in protected reefs, optimal protection was reached at a lower number of reefs protected, and life expectancy was higher with protection of highly suitable reefs. Synthesis and applications. Our framework can be applied to many studies using passive-acoustic telemetry to track animal movements. Protected area networks benefit species highly attached to protected sites. To increase benefits of marine protected area networks for all species (with low and high degrees of reef attachment) we need to understand the use of reef-adjacent areas, dispersal routes and characterize reef suitability for multiple species.","[Martin, Gerardo] Imperial Coll London St Marys, Fac Med, MRC Ctr Global Infect Dis Anal, Dept Infect Dis Epidemiol, London, England; [Espinoza, Mario] Univ Costa Rica, Ctr Invest Ciencias Mar & Limnol CIMAR, San Jose, Costa Rica; [Heupel, Michelle] Australian Inst Marine Sci, Townsville, Qld, Australia; [Simpfendorfer, Colin A.] James Cook Univ, Ctr Sustainable Trop Fisheries & Aquaculture, Townsville, Qld, Australia; [Simpfendorfer, Colin A.] James Cook Univ, Coll Sci & Engn, Townsville, Qld, Australia","Martin, G (corresponding author), Imperial Coll London St Marys, Fac Med, MRC Ctr Global Infect Dis Anal, Dept Infect Dis Epidemiol, London, England.",gerardommc@gmail.com,,"Martin, Gerardo/0000-0003-3608-5328",Natural Environmental Research Program [6.1],"Natural Environmental Research Program, Grant/Award Number: 6.1",,71,0,0,5,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8901,1365-2664,,J APPL ECOL,J.

With a fossil record extending back into the Devonian, several modifications in their body plan illustrate their body shape diversity through time. The angel sharks, whose fossil record dates back to the Late Jurassic, some 160 Ma, have a dorsoventrally flattened body, similar to skates and rays. Fossil skeletons of this group show that the overall morphology was well established earlier in its history. By examining the skull shape of well-preserved fossil material compared to extant angel sharks using geometric morphometric methods, within a phylogenetic framework, we were able to determine the conservative skull shape among angel sharks with a high degree of integration. The morphospace occupation of extant angel sharks is rather restricted, with extensive overlap. Most of the differences in skull shape are related to their geographic distribution patterns. We found higher levels of disparity in extinct forms, but lower ones in extant species. Since angel sharks display a highly specialized prey capture behaviour, we suggest that the morphological integration and biogeographic processes are the main drivers of their diversity, which might limit their capacity to display higher disparities since their origin.","[Lopez-Romero, Faviel A.; Stumpf, Sebastian; Pfaff, Cathrin; Kriwet, Jurgen] Univ Vienna, Geoctr, Dept Palaeontol, Althanstr 14, A-1090 Vienna, Austria; [Marrama, Giuseppe] Univ Torino, Dipartimento Sci Terra, Via Valperga Caluso 35, I-10125 Turin, Italy; [Johanson, Zerina] Nat Hist Museum, Dept Earth Sci, Cromwell Rd, London SW7 5BD, England","Lopez-Romero, FA (corresponding author), Univ Vienna, Geoctr, Dept Palaeontol, Althanstr 14, A-1090 Vienna, Austria.",faviel.alejandro.lopez.romero@univie.ac.at,,"Lopez Romero, Faviel/0000-0001-6500-0747; Stumpf, Sebastian/0000-0002-1945-2387",University of Vienna,"We would like to thank the staff of the Staatliches Museum fur Naturkunde Stuttgart, Geologisches und Palaontologisches Institut Tubingen and Naturhistorisches Museum Wien for access to the specimens used.

Hurricane Irene caused substantial economic damage when it hit the Mid-Atlantic Bight (MAB) off of the eastern United States in August of 2011. The MAB is highly stratified during the summer when a strong thermocline separates warm, surface water from deep, cold water, and this oceanographic phenomenon makes modeling hurricane strength difficult. Loggerhead sea turtles (Caretta caretta) forage in the MAB primarily during the stratified season and their dive behavior to the bottom allows them to experience the oceanographic conditions of the entire water column. Methods In this study, we analyzed the movements and dive behavior of juvenile and adult-sized loggerhead sea turtles (n = 18) that were foraging in the MAB as Hurricane Irene moved through the region. The satellite tags deployed on these turtles transmitted location data and dive behavior as well as sea surface temperature (SST) and temperature-depth profiles during this time. Results Behavioral and environmental shifts were observed during and after the hurricane compared to conditions before the storm. During the hurricane, most of the turtles (n = 15) moved north of their pre-storm foraging grounds. Following the storm, some turtles left their established foraging sites (n = 8) moving south by 7.3-135.0 km, and for the others that remained (n = 10), 12% of the observed dives were longer (0.54-1.11 h) than dives observed before the storm. The in situ data collected by the turtle-borne tags captured the cooling of the SST (Mean difference = 4.47 degrees C) and the deepening of the thermocline relative to the pre-storm conditions. Conclusions Some of the loggerhead behavior observed relative to a passing hurricane differed from the regular pattern of seasonal movement expected for turtles that forage in the MAB. These data documented the shifts in sea turtle behavior and distribution during an ecosystem-level perturbation and the recorded in situ data demonstrated that loggerheads observe environmental changes to the entire water column, including during extreme weather events.","[Crowe, Leah M.] NOAA, Integrated Stat Contract Northeast Fisheries Sci, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, 166 Water St, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA; [Hatch, Joshua M.; Haas, Heather L.] NOAA, Northeast Fisheries Sci Ctr, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, 166 Water St, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA; [Patel, Samir H.; Smolowitz, Ronald J.] Coonamessett Farm Fdn, 277 Hatchville Rd, East Falmouth, MA 02536 USA","Crowe, LM (corresponding author), NOAA, Integrated Stat Contract Northeast Fisheries Sci, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, 166 Water St, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA.",leah.crowe@noaa.gov,,"Crowe, Leah/0000-0001-9133-8522","Sea Scallop Research Set Aside program [NA11NMF4540024]; US Department of Interior, Bureau of Ocean Energy Management Inter-Agency Agreement [M10PG00075]","Turtle satellite tagging was made possible by funding from the Sea Scallop Research Set Aside program (NA11NMF4540024) and by a US Department of Interior, Bureau of Ocean Energy Management Inter-Agency Agreement (M10PG00075).",,74,0,0,4,4,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",2051-3933,,,MOV ECOL,Mov.

Species identification within this group has historically been problematic due to a high degree of morphological conservatism among congeners, further complicated by the possibility of interspecific hybridization. This study describes the development of two microsatellite panels comprising 10 polymorphic markers for the puffadder shyshark,Haploblepharus edwardsii. The markers were characterized in 35H. edwardsiispecimens and tested for cross-species utility inHaploblepharus fuscus,Haploblepharus pictus, and the more distantly related scyliorhinidHalaelurus natalensis. Genetic diversity statistics were estimated for each species, and the presence of population differentiation was tested for inH. edwardsiiandH. pictus. Furthermore, interspecific genetic differentiation was examined to infer the potential use of these markers for species identification as well as for detecting signatures of admixture amongHaploblepharusspecies. All microsatellite markers were polymorphic in each species, with polymorphism information contents ranging from 0.43 to 0.62. Population differentiation was only evident forH. pictus, where genetic discontinuity was detected among geographically distant sampling sites. Statistically significant differentiation (fixation index between populationsF(ST)= 0.091 to 0.382) was found between all species; however, the level of differentiation betweenH. fuscusandH. pictuswas low in comparison and seemingly at a population level rather than at a species level. Species assignment using Bayesian clustering analysis resulted in approximately 57% of 88 genotyped specimens being unambiguously assigned to a distinct genetic cluster that confirmed accurate taxonomic assignment. Overall, the low levels of differentiation together with the presence of distinct and admixed genetic clusters suggests a recent divergence and possible contemporary hybridization within the genusHaploblepharus.As such, conservation strategies should be focused on the generic level until such a time thatHaploblepharusspecies can be readily identified.","[van Staden, Michaela; Gledhill, Katie Samantha; Rhode, Clint; van der Merwe, Aletta Elizabeth] Stellenbosch Univ, Dept Genet, Mol Breeding & Biodivers Res Grp, Stellenbosch, Western Cape, South Africa; [Gledhill, Katie Samantha] Univ Technol Sydney, Sch Life Sci, Fish Ecol Lab, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Gledhill, Katie Samantha; McCord, Meaghen Erica] South African Shark Conservancy, Hermanus, Western Cape, South Africa; [Gennari, Enrico] Oceans Res, Mossel Bay, Western Cape, South Africa; [Gennari, Enrico; Parkinson, Matthew; Watson, Ralph Gareth Andrew] South African Inst Aquat Biodivers, Grahamstown, Eastern Cape, South Africa; [Gennari, Enrico; Parkinson, Matthew; Watson, Ralph Gareth Andrew] Rhodes Univ, Dept Ichthyol & Fisheries Sci, Grahamstown, Eastern Cape, South Africa","van Staden, M (corresponding author), Stellenbosch Univ, Mol Breeding & Biodivers Res Grp, Stellenbosch, South Africa.",mixvanstaden@gmail.com,,"McCord, Meaghen/0000-0001-7219-9176; Gledhill, Katie/0000-0002-4614-8671; van Staden, Michaela/0000-0003-2798-7821","Foundational Biodiversity Information Programme (FBIP) from the National Research Foundation (NRF), South Africa; Fisheries Society of the British Isles (FSBI)","The authors would like to thank Tinus Beukes (Two Oceans Aquarium), Robin Leslie (Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries), and Mary Rowlinson (White Shark Diving Company) for assisting with sample collection.

Theory predicts that faster-growing individuals suffer higher mortality and that this trade-off is mediated through exploration/risk-taking personality, but empirical support for this remains limited and ambiguous. Equivocal support to the POLS hypothesis suggests that the link between life history and personality may only emerge under certain circumstances. Understanding personality-driven trade-offs would be facilitated by long-term studies in wild populations experiencing different ecological conditions. Here, we tested whether personality measured in semi-captivity was associated with a growth-mortality trade-off via risk-taking in the wild in two subpopulations of juvenile lemon sharksNegaprion brevirostrisknown to differ in their predator abundance. We expected stronger personality-driven trade-offs in the predator-rich environment as compared to the predator-poor environment. Sharks were captured yearly from 1995 onwards allowing us to obtain long-term data on growth and apparent survival in each subpopulation. We then used a novel open-field assay to test sharks for exploration personality yearly from 2012 to 2017. A subset of the tested sharks was monitored in the field using telemetry to document risk-taking behaviours. We tested (a) if fast explorers in captivity took more risks and grew faster in the wild and (b) if natural selection acted against more explorative, faster-growing sharks. In the subpopulation with fewer predators, more explorative sharks in captivity took more risks in the wild and grew faster. In turn, larger, fast-growing sharks had lower apparent survival. In the predator-rich subpopulation, despite finding selection on fast growth, we found no link between exploration personality and the growth-mortality trade-off. Our study demonstrates that the association between personality and life history is favoured in some ecological contexts but not in others. We identify predator and resource abundance as two main potential drivers of the personality-mediated trade-off and emphasize that future work on the POLS hypothesis would benefit from an approach integrating behaviour and life history across ecological conditions.","[Dhellemmes, Felicie; Laskowski, Kate L.; Krause, Jens] Leibniz Inst Freshwater Ecol & Inland Fisheries, Berlin, Germany; [Dhellemmes, Felicie; Krause, Jens] Humboldt Univ, Fac Life Sci, Albrecht Daniel Thaer Inst Agr & Hort Sci, Berlin, Germany; [Dhellemmes, Felicie; Finger, Jean-Sebastien; Smukall, Matthew J.; Gruber, Samuel H.; Guttridge, Tristan L.] Bimini Biol Field Stn Fdn, South Bimini, Bahamas; [Smukall, Matthew J.] Univ Alaska Fairbanks, Coll Fisheries & Ocean Sci, Fairbanks, AK USA; [Guttridge, Tristan L.] Saving Blue, Miami, FL USA; [Laskowski, Kate L.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Evolut & Ecol, Davis, CA 95616 USA","Dhellemmes, F (corresponding author), Leibniz Inst Freshwater Ecol & Inland Fisheries, Berlin, Germany.; Dhellemmes, F (corresponding author), Humboldt Univ, Fac Life Sci, Albrecht Daniel Thaer Inst Agr & Hort Sci, Berlin, Germany.; Dhellemmes, F (corresponding author), Bimini Biol Field Stn Fdn, South Bimini, Bahamas.",Felicie.dhellemmes@gmail.com,,"Dhellemmes, Felicie/0000-0002-2043-4653",Elsa Neumann Stipendiums des Landes; Guy Harvey Ocean Foundation; Save Our Seas Foundation [SOS 367]; Sonotronics Don L.

Growing population has forced intensification of trawl netting by commercial fishermen all along the offshore during the last few decades. This paper presents a case study of Shankarpur-Digha-Petua fishing zone where modern bull trawlers continuously drag bigger trawl nets through ocean bottom and obtain huge commercial catch destroying at random under-sea habitat of many non-economic but ecologically valuable marine species. Trawling has been proved to destroy many ecologically worthy juveniles occupying the primary and secondary trophic levels of marine food chain. Anthropogenic malpractice seems to have created a great food crisis for all predators including apex species like shark, dolphin, and seal whose sustenance is suspected to be at stake leaving seafood-dependent coastal fishing population as the worst sufferer.

An effective Environmental Management Plan is also discussed here which will help keeping balance between ecology and economy to ensure conservative use of marine resources towards sustainable development of the ecology of this World Heritage Site.","[Das, Mahua] Univ Calcutta, Bhawanipur Educ Soc Coll, Earth Sci, 26 Harisava St, Kolkata 700023, W Bengal, India","Das, M (corresponding author), Univ Calcutta, Bhawanipur Educ Soc Coll, Earth Sci, 26 Harisava St, Kolkata 700023, W Bengal, India.",mdgeo2003@yahoo.co.in,,,"University Grants Commission, New Delhi, IndiaUniversity Grants Commission, India","Financial assistance given by University Grants Commission, New Delhi, India under Minor Research Project, 2017-2019.",,6,0,0,0,0,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2363-5037,2363-5045,,SUST WAT RESOUR MAN,Sustain.

Sarawak swellshark Cephaloscyllium sarawakensis of the family Scyliorhinidae from the South China Sea performs a new mode of oviparity, which is named sustained single oviparity, characterized by a lengthy retention of a single egg case in an oviduct until the embryo attains a sizable length. The resulting fecundity of the Sarawak swellshark within a season is quite low, but this disadvantage is balanced by smaller body, larger neonates and quicker maturation. The Sarawak swellshark is further uniquely characterized by having glassy transparent egg cases, and this is correlated with a vivid polka-dot pattern of the embryos. Five modes of lecithotrophic (yolk-dependent) reproduction, i.e. short single oviparity, sustained single oviparity, multiple oviparity, yolk-sac viviparity of single pregnancy and yolk-sac viviparity of multiple pregnancy were discussed from an evolutionary point of view.","[Nakaya, Kazuhiro] Hokkaido Univ, 3-1-1 Minato Cho, Hakodate, Hokkaido 0418611, Japan; [White, William T.] Natl Res Collect Australia, CSIRO, Australian Natl Fish Collect, GPO Box 1538, Hobart, Tas, Australia; [Ho, Hsuan-Ching] Natl Museum Marine Biol & Aquarium, Pingtung, Taiwan; [Ho, Hsuan-Ching] Natl Dong Hwa Univ, Inst Marine Biol, Pingtung, Taiwan","Ho, HC (corresponding author), Natl Museum Marine Biol & Aquarium, Pingtung, Taiwan.; Ho, HC (corresponding author), Natl Dong Hwa Univ, Inst Marine Biol, Pingtung, Taiwan.",ogcoho@gmail.com,,,"Ministry of Science and Technology, Executive Yuan, Taiwan; National Museum of Marine Biology and Aquarium, Pingtung, Taiwan","This study is supported by the Ministry of Science and Technology, Executive Yuan, Taiwan and the National Museum of Marine Biology and Aquarium, Pingtung, Taiwan.

Although molecular barcoding may be the fastest choice to determine the identity of a given species, robust and fast species level identification in the field using morphological characters is essential. During this study, 389 specimens representing seven stingray species (Brevitrygon walga, Himantura leoparda, H. uarnak, Maculabatis randalli, M. arabica, M. gerrardi and Pateobatis fai) were examined from the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman. A 1044 bp fragment of the NADH2 gene was generated for 50 specimens with representatives of all species. To verify the initial morphological identification and to compare intra-and interspecific differences a Neighbor-Joining analysis was conducted using uncorrected p-distances, whereas the Bayesian Inference was used to examine the relationships among taxa. Two species (M. arabica and M. gerrardi) are documented from the Persian Gulf for the first time. The molecular results provide the first known evidence of the sympatric distribution of M. randalli and M. arabica in the north and northwestern Indian Ocean. The results of the Bayesian Inference support the recent divergence of both species. Based on morphological comparisons and molecular support we suggest that the descriptions of M. randalli and M. arabica have been carried out on heterogeneous type series which has led to inconsistency between molecular identification and diagnostic morphological characteristics. Detailed morphological examination revealed that there is a relation between the type and number of denticles on the mid-dorsal surface of the disc and the color pattern of the tail. To address this taxonomic conflict all type materials should be re-examined. The Bayesian Inference tree showed that all specimens from the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman morphologically resembling B. walga were found to group well outside those of the Indian species (B. imbricata) with an average p-distance of 0.097. The low nucleotide differences among the urogymnid taxa (P. fai and H. leoparda) from the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman and their conspecific specimens in the Indo-West Pacific region revealed that philopatric behaviors may cause considerable gene flow among populations.","[Golzarianpour, Kiavash; Malek, Masoumeh] Univ Tehran, Coll Sci, Sch Biol, Tehran, Iran; [Golzarianpour, Kiavash; Malek, Masoumeh] Univ Tehran, Coll Sci, Ctr Excellence Phylogeny Living Organisms, Tehran, Iran; [Golestaninasab, Mehdi] Semnan Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Biol, Semnan, Iran; [Sarafrazi, Alimorad] Iranian Res Inst Plant Protect, Insect Taxon Res Dept, Tehran, Iran; [Kochmann, Judith; Klimpel, Sven] Goethe Univ, Inst Ecol Divers & Evolut, Frankfurt, Germany; [Kochmann, Judith; Klimpel, Sven] Senckenberg Biodivers & Climate Res Ctr, Senckenberg Gesell Nat Forsch, Frankfurt, Germany","Malek, M (corresponding author), Univ Tehran, Coll Sci, Sch Biol, Tehran, Iran.; Malek, M (corresponding author), Univ Tehran, Coll Sci, Ctr Excellence Phylogeny Living Organisms, Tehran, Iran.",kiavashpro@gmail.com; memalek@ut.ac.ir; mgolestaninasab@gmail.com; asarafrazi@yahoo.com; judith.kochmann@senckenberg.de; Klimpel@bio.uni-frankfurt.de,,,University of TehranUniversity of Tehran,"We are grateful to Antje Steinbrink from Goethe-University, Frankfurt/Main (Germany) for her comment on the molecular work.

Sharks are an understudied group regarding their susceptibility to microplastic ingestion. Here, we provide evidence of ingestion of microplastic and other anthropogenic fibres in four demersal sharks species found in the waters of the United Kingdom and investigate whether body burdens of contamination vary according to species, sex or size. Sharks were collected from the North-East Atlantic. Stomachs and digestive tracts of 46 sharks of 4 species were examined and 67% of samples contained at least one contaminant particle. Although we acknowledge modest sample size, estimated particle burden increased with body size but did not vary systematically with sex or species. A total of 379 particles were identified, leading to median estimates ranging from 2 to 7.5 ingested contaminants per animal for the 4 species. The majority were fibrous in nature (95%) and blue (88%) or black (9%) in colour. A subsample of contaminants (N=62) were subject to FT-IR spectroscopy and polymers identified as: synthetic cellulose (33.3%), polypropylene (25%), polyacrylamides (10%) and polyester (8.3%). The level of risk posed to shark species by this level of contamination is unknown. Nevertheless, this study presents the first empirical evidence and an important baseline for ingestion of microplastics and other anthropogenic fibres in native UK shark species and highlights the pervasive nature of these pollutants.","[Parton, Kristian J.; Godley, Brendan J.; Omeyer, Lucy C.

The genus has not been reported with confidence outside of the Tethyan region, but we have identified two new species of Mennerotodus from Paleogene deposits of the southeastern United States. Mennerotodus mackayi sp. nov. is described by teeth occurring in the lower Paleocene (Danian Stage) Pine Barren Member of the Clayton Formation of southern Alabama. A middle Eocene (Bartonian) species, Mennerotodus parmleyi sp. nov., is based on material occurring in the Clinchfield Formation in central Georgia. The early Paleocene record could indicate a North American origin for Mennerotodus relatively soon after the K-Pg event, with subsequent radiation to other parts of the world. The genus is likely more widely distributed than is currently known, but teeth can easily be overlooked due to their similarity to other taxa.","[Cicimurri, David J.] South Carolina State Museum, 301 Gervais St, Columbia, SC 29201 USA; [Ebersole, Jun A.] McWane Sci Ctr, 200 19th St North, Birmingham, AL 35203 USA; [Martin, George] 641 Apache St, Auburn, AL 36830 USA","Cicimurri, DJ (corresponding author), South Carolina State Museum, 301 Gervais St, Columbia, SC 29201 USA.",dave.cicimurri@scmuseum.org,,,,,,70,0,0,0,0,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",2193-0066,1860-1014,,FOSS REC,Foss.

Decades of overexploitation have devastated shark populations, leaving considerable doubt as to their ecological status(1,2). Yet much of what is known about sharks has been inferred from catch records in industrial fisheries, whereas far less information is available about sharks that live in coastal habitats(3). Here we address this knowledge gap using data from more than 15,000 standardized baited remote underwater video stations that were deployed on 371 reefs in 58 nations to estimate the conservation status of reef sharks globally. Our results reveal the profound impact that fishing has had on reef shark populations: we observed no sharks on almost 20% of the surveyed reefs. Reef sharks were almost completely absent from reefs in several nations, and shark depletion was strongly related to socio-economic conditions such as the size and proximity of the nearest market, poor governance and the density of the human population. However, opportunities for the conservation of reef sharks remain: shark sanctuaries, closed areas, catch limits and an absence of gillnets and longlines were associated with a substantially higher relative abundance of reef sharks. These results reveal several policy pathways for the restoration and management of reef shark populations, from direct top-down management of fishing to indirect improvement of governance conditions. Reef shark populations will only have a high chance of recovery by engaging key socio-economic aspects of tropical fisheries.","[MacNeil, M.

In order to solve the MCDM issues, a better way is provided by the fuzzy logic. Expendability, cost, maintenance, availability of software, and performance characteristics are such problems considered by the decision. The precise estimation of the pertinent data is one of the vital phases in DM systems. This paper presents a fuzzy MCDM-based cluster head (CH) selection and hybrid routing protocol to solve the most common issues. In this research article, the generalized intuitionistic fuzzy soft set (GIFSS) approach is utilized to select the optimal CH, and hybrid shark smell optimization (SSO), and a genetic algorithm (GA) is introduced for the effective routing. Initially, the wireless sensor network (WSN) system and energy models are designed, and then the nodes are grouped into several clusters. Next, based on the GIFSS, the CH nodes are selected, and finally, an effective routing is placed based on the hybrid optimizations. The implementation is performed on the NS2 platform, and the performances are evaluated by packet delivery ratio (PDR), delay, packet loss ratio (PLR), network lifetime, bit error rate (BER), energy consumption, throughput, and jitter. The existing approaches named energy centers examining using particle swarm optimization (EC-PSO), variable dimension-based PSO (VD-PSO), energy-efficient PSO-based CH selection (PSO-ECHS), low-energy adaptive clustering hierarchy-sugeno fuzzy (LEACH-SF), SSO, and GA are compared with the proposed strategy. According to the implemented outcomes, it displays the proposed strategy and gives improved outcomes than the others.","[Sreedharan, Panchikattil Susheelkumar; Pete, Dnyandeo Jageshwar] Datta Meghe Coll Engn, Dept Elect Engn, Mumbai 400708, Maharashtra, India","Sreedharan, PS (corresponding author), Datta Meghe Coll Engn, Dept Elect Engn, Mumbai 400708, Maharashtra, India.",susheelkumarsredh34@gmail.com,,"Susheelkumar Sreedharan, Panchikattil/0000-0002-4195-6039",,,,31,0,0,3,3,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1074-5351,1099-1131,,INT J COMMUN SYST,Int.

We describe the development of an anti-DLL4 VNAR and the site-specific conjugation of this to poly(lactic-co-glycolic) acid PEGylated NPs using surface maleimide functional groups. These nanoconjugates were shown to specifically bind DLL4 with high affinity and were preferentially internalized by DLL4-expressing pancreatic cancer cell lines and endothelial cells. Furthermore, a distinct anti-angiogenic effect endowed by the anti-DLL4 VNAR was evident inin vitrotubulogenic assays. Taken together these findings highlight the potential of anti-DLL4 targeted polymeric NPs as a novel therapeutic approach in pancreatic cancer.","[Leach, Adam; Smyth, Peter; Greene, Michelle K.; Branco, Cristina M.; McCann, Aidan P.; Scott, Christopher J.] Queens Univ Belfast, Sch Med, Patrick G Johnston Ctr Canc Res, Belfast, Antrim, North Ireland; [Ferguson, Laura; Steven, John; Porter, Andrew; Barelle, Caroline J.] Elasmogen Ltd, Aberdeen, Scotland; [Porter, Andrew] Univ Aberdeen, Inst Med Sci, Aberdeen, Scotland","Scott, CJ (corresponding author), Queens Univ Belfast, Sch Med, Patrick G Johnston Ctr Canc Res, Belfast, Antrim, North Ireland.; Barelle, CJ (corresponding author), Elasmogen Ltd, Aberdeen, Scotland.",caroline.barelle@elasmogen.com; c.scott@qub.ac.uk,,,Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) [S3802ASA]; Martin Family Foundation; US-Ireland R&D Partnership - HSCNI [STL/5010/14]; Medical Research Council UKMedical Research Council UK (MRC) [MC_PC_15013]; Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) [BB/R009112/1],"The authors acknowledge the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) (S3802ASA) and the generous support of the Martin Family Foundation for funding the Ph.D. studentships of P.

Florida's Indian River Lagoon (IRL), an estuary of national significance, has experienced many anthropogenic impacts in recent decades, such as habitat degradation and declining water quality, and there is a substantial data gap surrounding the status of elasmobranchs in this system. A fishery-independent survey (longline/gillnet) was implemented to characterize the elasmobranch community and understand distribution patterns and habitat use in the IRL (Sebastian to St. Lucie Inlet). From July 2016 to June 2018, 630 individuals of 16 species were caught and tagged, including two critically endangered smalltooth sawfishPristis pectinata. Bull sharksCarcharhinus leucasand Atlantic stingraysHypanus sabinuswere the two most common species collected (47% of the total catch), and size differences by region were observed. The longline catch exhibited a significant difference in species composition among regions while the gillnet catch composition significantly varied among seasons. Although dependent on survey gear type, there was evidence of combinations of abiotic parameters (e.g., depth, salinity, water clarity, distance to a freshwater source, distance to an inlet) driving elasmobranch species composition. Bull sharks and Atlantic stingrays dominated areas with frequently low salinities while more diverse assemblages of species were apparent towards inlet passes. This study provides the first in-depth analysis of the elasmobranch community in the IRL and develops capacity to understand how these species may respond to further environmental changes in this highly impacted estuary.","[Roskar, Grace; McCallister, Michael P.; Schaefer, Adam M.; Ajemian, Matthew J.] Florida Atlantic Univ, Harbor Branch Oceanog Inst, 5600 US 1 North, Ft Pierce, FL 34946 USA","Roskar, G (corresponding author), Florida Atlantic Univ, Harbor Branch Oceanog Inst, 5600 US 1 North, Ft Pierce, FL 34946 USA.",aroskar2017@fau.edu,,,Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institute Foundation (HBOIF) Save Our Seas Specialty License Plate Program; HBOIF Indian River Lagoon Graduate Research Fellowship; SeaWorld Bush Gardens Conservation Fund; Disney Conservation Fund; Sunrise Rotary Vero Beach Foundation,"The authors would like to thank the two anonymous reviewers for their constructive comments that helped improve this manuscript.

This review discusses the curious and complex architectures of shark and ray tessellated cartilage, highlighting similarities and differences with their mammalian skeletal tissue counterparts.

This study aimed to compare eDNA detection against well-established seasonal changes in blacktip shark (Carcharhinus limbatus) abundance in Terra Ceia Bay (FL, USA). We used a species-specific real-time PCR approach to detect C. limbatus eDNA in the bay on a near monthly basis from spring through mid-fall in 2018 and 2019. Previous studies have shown that C. limbatus give birth in the bay in early summer and immature sharks occur there until late fall, when decreasing water temperatures cause them to move offshore and southwards. Water samples (2 L) were collected (4-6 per month) and filtered in the field, with each then being subjected to real-time PCR. Carcharhinus limbatus 'positive' filters were significantly more commonly collected during the April-July sampling period than during the August-October sampling period. While following the predicted pattern, eDNA concentration was generally too low for accurate quantification. Our results show that C. limbatus eDNA detection follows known seasonal residency patterns consistently over 2 years of monitoring. Species-specific eDNA analysis using real-time PCR could therefore represent a cost-effective, scalable sampling tool to facilitate improved shark population monitoring in semi-enclosed marine habitats.","[Postaire, Bautisse D.; Bakker, Judith; Chapman, Demian D.] Florida Int Univ, Dept Biol Sci, 3000 NE 151st St, North Miami, FL 33181 USA; [Gardiner, Jayne] New Coll Florida, Div Nat Sci, 5800 Bayshore Rd, Sarasota, FL 34243 USA; [Wiley, Tonya R.] Havenworth Coastal Conservat, 5120 Beacon Rd, Palmetto, FL 34221 USA","Postaire, BD (corresponding author), Florida Int Univ, Dept Biol Sci, 3000 NE 151st St, North Miami, FL 33181 USA.",postaireb@gmail.com,,,Paul G Allen Family Foundation; Shark Conservation Fund,"This work was funded by the Paul G Allen Family Foundation and the Shark Conservation Fund and we especially thank R.

The patterns and processes that resulted in smoothhound biodiversity and present-day distribution remain largely unknown. We infer the phylogenetic relationships of the genusMustelus, based on sequence data (3474 bp) from three mitochondrial genes (CR, NADH-2 and 12S-16SrRNA) and a nuclear gene (KBTBD2) from seven species ofMustelusdistributed across the eastern Atlantic- and Indo-Pacific oceans. Using the CR and KBTBD2 dataset, we infer the phylogeographic placement of Old WorldMustelus,with particular reference to species from southern Africa. Using a near-complete phylogeny of the genus including Old World and New World species ofMustelusand publicly available sequences of the NADH-2 gene, we found supporting evidence indicating a major cladogenic event separating placental and aplacental species. Biogeographical analyses further revealed that the radiation ofMustelusin the southern African region was driven primarily by long-distance dispersal during the upper Miocene to lower Pleistocene. The placement of the placental blackspotted smoothhoundMustelus punctulatusat the base of the placental non-spotted clade suggests the secondary loss of black spots in the genus, and this was also supported by the ancestral state reconstruction.

Recent studies demonstrate the presence of sleep in flatworms and jellyfish, suggesting that this behaviour evolved early in the evolution of animals. Sharks are the earliest known extant, jawed vertebrates and may play an important role in understanding the evolutionary history of sleep in vertebrates, and yet, it is unknown whether they sleep. The Port Jackson (Heterodontus portusjacksoni) and draughtsboard (Cephaloscyllium isabellum) sharks are both benthic, buccal pumping species and remain motionless for extended periods of time. Whether these periods of prolonged inactivity represent sleep or quiet wakefulness is unknown. A key criterion for separating sleep from other quiescent states is an increased arousal threshold. We show here that inactive sharks of both species require significantly higher levels of electric stimulation before they show a visible response. Sharks deprived of rest, however, show no significant compensatory increase in restfulness during their normal active period following enforced swimming. Nonetheless, increased arousal thresholds in inactive animals suggest that these two species of shark sleep - the first such demonstration for members of this group of vertebrates. Further research, including electrophysiological studies, on these and other sharks, is required for a comprehensive understanding of sleep in cartilaginous fishes.","[Kelly, Michael L.; Hemmi, Jan M.] Univ Western Australia, Sch Biol Sci, Perth, WA, Australia; [Kelly, Michael L.; Hemmi, Jan M.; Collin, Shaun P.] Univ Western Australia, Oceans Inst, Perth, WA, Australia; [Kelly, Michael L.; Collin, Shaun P.] Univ Western Australia, Oceans Grad Sch, Perth, WA, Australia; [Spreitzenbarth, Stefan; Radford, Craig A.] Univ Auckland, Inst Marine Sci, Leigh Marine Lab, Auckland, New Zealand; [Kerr, Caroline C.; Lesku, John A.; Collin, Shaun P.] La Trobe Univ, Sch Life Sci, Melbourne, Vic, Australia","Radford, CA (corresponding author), Univ Auckland, Inst Marine Sci, Leigh Marine Lab, Auckland, New Zealand.; Collin, SP (corresponding author), La Trobe Univ, Sch Life Sci, Melbourne, Vic, Australia.",c.radford@auckland.ac.nz; s.collin@latrobe.edu.au,,"Kelly, Michael/0000-0003-3421-4026; Spreitzenbarth, Stefan/0000-0002-3773-0854",University of Western Australia; University of Auckland; Endeavour Leadership Program; Sea World Research & Rescue Foundation Inc.,"This study was supported by The University of Western Australia, The University of Auckland, The Endeavour Leadership Program and The Sea World Research & Rescue Foundation Inc.",,41,0,0,8,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0962-1105,1365-2869,,J SLEEP RES,J.

While all life stages of tiger sharks are known to occur in the Gulf of Mexico (GoM), variability in habitat use and movement patterns over ontogeny have never been quantified in this large marine ecosystem. To address this data gap we fitted 56 tiger sharks with Smart Position and Temperature transmitting tags between 2010 and 2018 and examined seasonal and spatial distribution patterns across the GoM. Additionally, we analyzed overlap of core habitats (i.e., 50% kernel density estimates) among individuals relative to large benthic features (oil and gas platforms, natural banks, bathymetric breaks). Our analyses revealed significant ontogenetic and seasonal differences in distribution patterns as well as across-shelf (i.e., regional) and sex-linked variability in movement rates. Presumably sub-adult and adult sharks achieved significantly higher movement rates and used off-shelf deeper habitats at greater proportions than juvenile sharks, particularly during the fall and winter seasons. Further, female maximum rate of movement was higher than males when accounting for size. Additionally, we found evidence of core regions encompassing the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration designated Habitat Areas of Particular Concern (i.e., shelf-edge banks) during cooler months, particularly by females, as well as 2,504 oil and gas platforms. These data provide a baseline for future assessments of environmental impacts, such as climate variability or oil spills, on tiger shark movements and distribution in the region. Future research may benefit from combining alternative tracking tools, such as acoustic telemetry and genetic approaches, which can facilitate long-term assessment of the species' movement dynamics and better elucidate the ecological significance of the core habitats identified here.","[Ajemian, Matthew J.] Florida Atlantic Univ, Harbor Branch, Oceanog Inst, Ft Pierce, FL 34946 USA; [Drymon, J.

India has one of the highest elasmobranch landings globally, through both targeted catch and bycatch. As elasmobranchs contribute to food and livelihood security, there is a need for holistic approaches to bycatch mitigation. We adopt an interdisciplinary approach to critically assess a range of hypothetical measures for reducing elasmobranch capture in a trawler fishery on India's west coast, using a risk-based mitigation hierarchy framework. Data were collected through landing surveys, interviews and a literature review, to assess the following potential management options for their technical effectiveness and socio-economic feasibility: (1) spatio-temporal closures; (2) net restrictions; (3) bycatch reduction devices (BRDs); and (4) live onboard release. Our study provides the first evidence-based and nuanced understanding of elasmobranch bycatch management for this fishery, and suggestions for future conservation and research efforts. Onboard release may be viable for species like guitarfish, with moderate chances of survival, and was the favored option among interview respondents due to minimal impact on earnings. While closures, net restrictions and BRDs may reduce elasmobranch capture, implementation will be challenging under present circumstances due to the potentially high impact on fisher income. Interventions for live release can therefore be used as a step toward ameliorating bycatch, while initiating longer-term engagement with the fishing community. Participatory monitoring can help address critical knowledge gaps in elasmobranch ecology. Spatio-temporal closures and gear restriction measures may then be developed through a bottom-up approach in the long term. Overall, the framework facilitated a holistic assessment of bycatch management to guide decision-making. Scaling-up and integrating such case studies across different species, fisheries and sites would support the formulation of a meaningful management plan for elasmobranch fisheries in India.","[Gupta, Trisha; Rao, Chetan; Manoharakrishnan, Muralidharan; Namboothri, Naveen; Shanker, Kartik] Dakshin Fdn, Bengaluru, India; [Booth, Hollie; Arlidge, William; Milner-Gulland, E.

Morphological dental changes through ontogeny have been identified in several species and have been correlated with shifts in diet and the acquisition of sexual maturity. However, these changes were rarely quantified in detail along multiple ontogenetic stages, which makes it difficult to infer the developmental processes responsible for the observed plasticity. In this work, we use micro-computed tomography and 3D geometric morphometrics to describe and analyze the tooth size and shape diversity across three ontogenetic stages (hatchling, juvenile, and sexually mature) in the large-spotted catsharkScyliorhinus stellaris(Linnaeus, 1758). We first describe the intra-individual variation of tooth form for each sex at each ontogenetic stage. We provide a tooth morphospace for palatoquadrate and Meckelian teeth and identify dental features, such as relative size and number of cusps, involved in the range of variation of the observed morphologies. We then use these shape data to draw developmental trajectories between ontogenetic stages and for each tooth position within the jaw to characterize ontogenetic patterns of sexual dimorphism. We highlight the emergence of gynandric heterodonty between the juvenile and mature ontogenetic stages, with mature females having tooth morphologies more similar to juveniles' than mature males that display regression in the number of accessory cusps. From these data, we speculate on the developmental processes that could account for such developmental plasticity inS. stellaris.","[Berio, Fidji; Evin, Allowen; Debiais-Thibaud, Melanie] Univ Montpellier, ISEM, Inst Sci Evolut Montpellier, CNRS,IRD,EPHE,UMR5554, Montpellier, France; [Berio, Fidji; Goudemand, Nicolas] Univ Lyon, Univ Claude Bernard Lyon 1, Ecole Normale Super Lyon, CNRS,Inst Genom Fonct Lyon,UMR 5242, Lyon, France","Debiais-Thibaud, M (corresponding author), Univ Montpellier, ISEM, Inst Sci Evolut Montpellier, CNRS,IRD,EPHE,UMR5554, Montpellier, France.",melanie.debiais-thibaud@umontpellier.fr,,"Berio, Fidji/0000-0003-0810-9783",ENS de Lyon Attractivite Nouveaux professeurs fund,This work was supported by the ENS de Lyon Attractivite Nouveaux professeurs fund (attributed to Nicolas Goudemand),,92,0,0,1,1,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-8782,1469-7580,,J ANAT,J.

The current study was aimed to comparatively evaluate the effects of spring and autumn extracts of A. aucheri Bioss on Leishmania major both in-vitro and in-vivo conditions. Methods: HPLC analysis was used to evaluate the percentages of compounds in spring and autumn extracts of A. aucheri. For in-vitro assay, the effect of different concentrations of spring and autumn extracts of A. aucheri was tested on L. major promastigotes and amastigotes. MTT and flow cytometry methods were used to evaluate the cytotoxicity and probable apoptosis of A. aucheri extracts on L. major promastigotes. On the other hand, for invivo assay, the extracts were used as ointments to treat lesions developed on BALB/c mice after 28 days post inoculation of L. major. The diameter of lesions and the survival rates of infected BALB/c mice were measured weekly for a period of two months. Results: The HPLC analysis showed the substance Quercitrin was present in the spring A. aucheri extract but not in the autumn extract. The mean numbers of amastigotes in each treated macrophage with the spring and autumn A. aucheri extracts were 1.2 and 1.8 respectively, which showed statistically significant differences (P < 0.05). Flow cytometry revealed that the spring and autumn A. aucheri extracts caused about 32% and 3.78% apoptosis respectively. The inhibitory concentration (IC50) of spring and autumn A. aucheri extracts to amastigotes were determined to be 90 mu g/mL and 183 mu g/mL respectiovely. In-vivo, the diameter of lesions treated with the spring A. aucheri extract was significantly less (P < 0.05) compared to those treated with the autumn extract (2.6 and 7.8 mm respectively). Also, mice treated with spring A. aucheri extract had higher survival rates compared to control group. Conclusion: Given the above results, it can be concluded that spring A. aucheri extract has a greater fatality effect on L. major promastigotes in-vitro compared to the autum extract. In addition, the spring extract has stronger therapeutic effect on lesions caused by L. major in BALB/c mice than the autum extract.","[KarimiPourSaryazdi, Amir; Ghaffarifar, Fatemeh; Dalimi, Abdolhossein; Dayer, Mohammad Saaid] Tarbiat Modares Univ, Fac Med Sci, Dept Parasitol, POB 14115-111, Tehran, Iran","Ghaffarifar, F (corresponding author), Tarbiat Modares Univ, Fac Med Sci, Dept Parasitol, POB 14115-111, Tehran, Iran.",amirkarimipour49@gmail.com; ghafarif@modares.ac.ir; dalimi_a@modares.ac.ir; dayer@modares.ac.ir,,,"Tarbiat Modares University, Iran [78235]","This project funded by Tarbiat Modares University, Iran.

From data mining, we found a novel prmt8e6 + 43 splicing variant with a 43-nucleotide (nt) extension at the 5' of exon 6 in chicken. RT-PCR analyses confirmed the existence of two splicing variants but also detected a third upper signal. The triplet pattern detected in chicken suggests that one strand from the prmt8e6 + 43 transcript and one strand from the regular splicing products form a heteroduplex with a bulb conformation and the two transcripts are of similar abundance. One short plus one faint upper heteroduplex signal detected in mouse and human indicate that the level of the variant is much less than the normal one in mammals. The relative expression of the normal and prmt8e6 + 43 variants in different species can be inferred from the reads of intron 5 that contains the 43-nt extension or not in the RNA-seq data of NCBI Gene database. The results of the analyses showed that the prmt8e6 + 43 variant is relatively abundant in birds but much less or even not detected in mammalian species. As conserved intron 5 sequences and evidences of alternative splicing (AS) are detected in elephant shark, a cartilaginous fish with the slowest-evolving genome, we propose that the prmt8e6 + 43 variant is present in the common ancestor of jawed vertebrates. The prmt8e6 + 43 variant includes a premature termination codon and thus should encode a truncated PRMT8 with deletion from the dimerization arm. Western blot analyses showed very weak low-molecular-weight signals in chicken, which might be the C-terminal truncated PRMT8. Why avian species maintain high RNA but not protein levels of the prmt8e6 + 43 variant and whether the evolutionary conserved sequence and AS might regulate PRMT8 expression require further investigation.","[Wang, Yi-Chun; Chang, Chien-Ping; Tsai, Yun-Jung; Lee, Yu-Jen; Li, Chuan] Chung Shan Med Univ, Dept Biomed Sci, 110,Sec 1,Jian Guo N Rd, Taichung 4020, Taiwan; [Wang, Yi-Chun; Li, Chuan] Chung Shan Med Univ Hosp, Dept Med Res, Taichung, Taiwan","Li, C (corresponding author), Chung Shan Med Univ, Dept Biomed Sci, 110,Sec 1,Jian Guo N Rd, Taichung 4020, Taiwan.",cli@csmu.edu.tw,,,"Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan, ROCMinistry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [MOST 103-2320-B-040-022-MY3, MOST 106-2320-B-040-018, MOST 107-2320-B-040-022]","The study was supported by MOST 103-2320-B-040-022-MY3, MOST 106-2320-B-040-018, MOST 107-2320-B-040-022 from Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan, ROC to CL.",,36,0,0,1,1,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0378-1119,1879-0038,,GENE,Gene,Jul-15,2020,747,,,,,,,,144684,10.1016/j.gene.2020.144684,,,8,Genetics & Heredity,Genetics & Heredity,LK2ST,WOS:000530712100018,32311412,,,,9/10/20

There is potential monetary and conservation value in developing a stable captive population of horseshoe crabs, however, one major impediment to achieving captivity is a lack of knowledge regarding captive diseases. We utilized 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing to track changes in the microbiomes of four body locations in three wild-caught (tracked over 14 months in captivity) and three tank-acclimated (>2 years in captivity) adultL. polyphemusin a touch tank at Shark Reef Aquarium at Mandalay Bay in Las Vegas, NV. The wild population hosted diverse and distinct microbiomes on the carapace (260 +/- 96 amplicon sequence variants or ASVs), cloaca (345 +/- 77 ASVs), gills (309 +/- 36 ASVs), and oral cavity (359 +/- 37 ASVs), which were dominated by classesGammaproteobacteria,Bacteroidia, andAlphaproteobacteria. A rapid decline in richness across all body locations was observed within 1 month of captivity, with tank-acclimated (>2 years) animals having <5% of the initial microbiome richness and a nearly completely restructured microbial community. Tank-acclimated horseshoe crabs possessed distinct microbiomes that were highly uneven and low in species richness on the carapace (31 +/- 7 ASVs), cloaca (53 +/- 19 ASVs), gills (17 +/- 2 ASVs), and oral cavity (31 +/- 13 ASVs). The carapace, oral cavity, and gills of the tank-acclimated animals hosted abundant populations ofAeromonas(>60%) andPseudomonas(>20%), both of which are known opportunistic pathogens of aquatic animals and can express chitinases, providing a plausible mechanism for the development of the carapace lesion pathology observed in this and other studies. The cloaca of the tank-acclimated animals was slightly more diverse than the other body locations withAeromonas,Enterococcus,Shewanella, andVagococcusdominating the community. These results provide an important baseline on the microbiomes of both wild and tank-acclimated horseshoe crabs and underscore the need to continue to investigate how native microbial populations may protect animals from pathogens.","[Friel, Ariel D.; Neiswenter, Sean A.; Seymour, Cale O.; Bali, Lauren Rose; McNamara, Ginger; Leija, Fabian; Hedlund, Brian P.] Univ Nevada, Sch Life Sci, Las Vegas, NV 89154 USA; [Jewell, Jack] Shark Reef Aquarium Mandalay Bay, Las Vegas, NV USA; [Hedlund, Brian P.] Univ Nevada, Nevada Inst Personalized Med, Las Vegas, NV 89154 USA","Neiswenter, SA; Hedlund, BP (corresponding author), Univ Nevada, Sch Life Sci, Las Vegas, NV 89154 USA.; Hedlund, BP (corresponding author), Univ Nevada, Nevada Inst Personalized Med, Las Vegas, NV 89154 USA.",Sean.Neiswenter@unlv.edu; brian.hedlund@unlv.edu,,,"U.S. Department of Education: Asian American and Native American Pacific Islander-Serving Institutions (AANAPISI) program [P031150019]; National Science Foundation, Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (LSAMP) [HRD-1712523]","Portions of this project were supported by the undergraduate research grants to GM and LB [U.S. Department of Education: Asian American and Native American Pacific Islander-Serving Institutions (AANAPISI) program, Grant #: P031150019] and FL [National Science Foundation, Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (LSAMP), Grant #: HRD-1712523].",,105,0,0,2,2,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",1664-302X,,,FRONT MICROBIOL,Front.

Such changes may influence marine ectotherms, such as sharks, as their body temperature concurrently increases toward their upper thermal limits. Sharks are high trophic level predators that play a key role in the regulation of ecosystem structure and health. Because many sharks are already threatened, it is especially important to understand the impact of climate change on these species. We used shark occurrence records collected by commercial fisheries within the Australian continental Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) to predict changes in future (2050-2099) relative to current (1956-2005) habitat suitability for pelagic sharks based on an ensemble of climate models and emission scenarios. Our predictive models indicate that future sea temperatures are likely to shift the location of suitable shark habitat within the Australian EEZ. On average, suitable habitat is predicted to decrease within the EEZ for requiem and increase for mackerel sharks, however, the direction and severity of change was highly influenced by the choice of climate model. Our results indicate the need to consider climate change scenarios as part of future shark management and suggest that more broad -scale studies are needed for these pelagic species.","[Birkmanis, Charlotte A.; Sequeira, Ana M.

Research on the angelshark (Squatina squatina) is in its infancy, and is particularly challenging during the early life stages, in part because of their rarity, but also because of their camouflage and cryptic behaviour. Focused research on the identification and protection of juvenile angelshark habitat in their stronghold of the Canary Islands has been identified as a priority action to help safeguard the future of this species. This study combines citizen-science data, satellite imagery, and focused snorkel surveys to complete a first evaluation of juvenile angelshark habitat in the region, upon which further research can be built. One confirmed nursery area, 13 potential nursery areas, and 21 beaches needing further study were identified in this study, based on the existing nursery area criteria. The results were used to develop eight key recommendations on how local and national governments can better protect juvenile angelsharks in the Canary Islands. Further research is urgently needed to confirm whether other beaches in the archipelago meet the nursery area criteria.","[Jimenez-Alvarado, David] Univ Las Palmas Gran Canaria, IU ECOAQUA, Grp Biodiversidad & Conservac, Las Palmas Gran Canaria, Islas Canarias, Spain; [Meyers, Eva K.

Estuaries provide essential habitat for many fishes, including elasmobranchs, particularly as nurseries. Shore-based, gillnet surveys have documented ten elasmobranch species (sharks and batoids) inhabiting Texas estuaries; however, limitations in the methodology, spatial, and temporal scope employed mean the role of these estuaries as elasmobranch nurseries remains uncertain. Therefore, an alternative sampling technique was implemented to survey open water locations in two Texas estuaries during the peak time of putative elasmobranch nursery usage (May to October). Ten species of elasmobranch were observed, including a shark,Carcharhinus porosus, and batoid species,Hypanus americanus, that were not documented in previous surveys. The most commonly encountered species,Carcharhinus brevipinna, comprised 45% of individuals caught, in contrast to previous surveys of these estuaries, in which the species was less than 1% of the total elasmobranch catch. The results revealed a distinction between sharks and batoids in terms of the life history stages present, as well as the depths and distances from the tidal inlet of areas in which they were encountered. Young-of-the-year and small juvenileCarcharhinus brevipinnaandSphyrna lewiniwere observed across multiple years and in multiple months within years at one site, suggesting that one of the sampled estuaries functions as a nursery. Although putative nurseries for these species have been identified elsewhere in the world, estuaries serving as nursery grounds in the western Gulf of Mexico are not well described.","[Swift, Dominic G.; Portnoy, David S.] Texas A&M Univ Corpus Christi, Dept Life Sci, Marine Genom Lab, 6300 Ocean Dr, Corpus Christi, TX 78412 USA","Swift, DG (corresponding author), Texas A&M Univ Corpus Christi, Dept Life Sci, Marine Genom Lab, 6300 Ocean Dr, Corpus Christi, TX 78412 USA.",dominic.swift@tamucc.edu,,,Texas Parks and Wildlife Department through the State Wildlife Grant Program CFDA [15.64],This work was financially supported by Texas Parks and Wildlife Department through the State Wildlife Grant Program CFDA#15.64.,,84,0,0,0,0,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1559-2723,1559-2731,,ESTUAR COAST,Estuaries Coasts,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1007/s12237-020-00797-y,,Jul-20,13,Environmental Sciences; Marine & Freshwater Biology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Marine & Freshwater Biology,MT5TC,WOS:000555036500001,,,,,9/10/20

We consider extensions of the Elephant Random Walk introduced by Schutz and Trimper (Phys Rev E 70:044510(R), 2004) with stronger reinforcement mechanisms, where, roughly speaking, a step from the past is remembered proportional to some weight and then repeated with probability p. With probability 1 - p, the random walk performs a step independent of the past. The weight of the remembered step is increased by an additive factor b >= 0, making it likelier to repeat the step again in the future. A combination of techniques from the theory of urns, branching processes and alpha-stable processes enables us to discuss the limit behavior of reinforced versions of both the Elephant Random Walk and its alpha-stable counterpart, the so-called Shark Random Swim introduced by Businger (J Stat Phys 172(3):701-717, 2004).

As a possible solution, the effectiveness of virtual reality (VR) exposure therapy for this phobia was tested. The advantage of using VR becomes clearer when a real life set up is impractical, such as exposing a phobic patient to a feared large marine organism, the shark. The effects were evaluated in a single case study involving multiple context-graded aquatic virtual environments with a virtual shark and using affordable VR apparatus and software. Assessment was based on self-report questionnaires. Scores the psychometric instruments exhibited a discernable reduction in fear toward sharks. Such gains were maintained at a 12-month follow-up. Presence rates indicated immersion when confronted to a three-dimensional (3D) virtual shark. This initial study revealed the potential of VR for the treatment of marine biota phobia and its potential to recreate diverse situations for exposure therapy.","[Malbos, Eric] Aix Marseille Univ, CNRS, UMR 7249, Fresnel Inst, Marseille, France; [Malbos, Eric; Lancon, Christophe] Conception Univ Hosp, AP HM, Dept Psychiat, Marseille, France; [Burgess, George H.] Univ Florida, Florida Program Shark Res, Gainesville, FL USA","Malbos, E (corresponding author), Hop Conception, Pole Psychiat Ctr, Serv Psychiat Adultes Pr Lancon, 145 Bd Baille, F-13005 Marseille, France.",eric.malbos@gmail.com,,,,,,43,0,0,6,6,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1534-6501,1552-3802,,CLIN CASE STUD,Clin.

To understand their patterns of movement in Seychelles, we used three techniques-archival pop-up satellite tags, acoustic tags, and photo-identification-and focussed on the aggregation at D'Arros Island and St. Joseph Atoll within the Amirantes Group. M. alfredi were photographed within six of the seven Island Groups of Seychelles, with 64% of individuals being resighted at least once between July 2006 and December 2019 over timeframes of 1-3,462 days (9.5 years; median = 1,018 days). Only three individuals from D'Arros Island were resighted at a second aggregation site located more than 200 km away at St. Francois Atoll during photo-identification surveys. Satellite-tracked M. alfredi (n = 5 tracks; maximum 180 days) remained within the boundary of the Seychelles Exclusive Economic Zone, where they spent the majority of their time (87%) in the upper 50 m of the water column in close proximity to the Amirantes Bank. The inclusion of acoustic tagging data in the models of estimated satellite-track paths significantly reduced the errors associated with the geolocation positions derived from archived light level data. The insights gained into the patterns of horizontal and vertical movements of M. alfredi using this multi-technique approach highlight the significance of D'Arros Island and St. Joseph Atoll, and the wider Amirantes Group, to M. alfredi in Seychelles, and will benefit future conservation efforts for this species within Seychelles and the broader Western Indian Ocean.","[Peel, Lauren R.; Collin, Shaun P.] Univ Western Australia, Oceans Inst, Sch Biol Sci, Crawley, WA, Australia; [Peel, Lauren R.; Collin, Shaun P.] Univ Western Australia, Oceans Grad Sch, Crawley, WA, Australia; [Peel, Lauren R.; Meekan, Mark G.] Australian Inst Marine Sci, Crawley, WA, Australia; [Peel, Lauren R.; Stevens, Guy M.

They are Acanthobothrium catvlinae sp. n. from Bathyraja magellanica (Philippi) and Acanthobothrium domingae sp. n. from Dipturus brevicaudatus (Marini). Both belong to category 1 and 2 because their total length is lower than 15 mm, they have fewer than 50 proglottids, fewer than 80 testes and a symmetric or asymmetric ovary. Acanthobothrium catvlinae sp. n. differs from all congeners by the following combination of features: proglottid apolysis, hook morphology, microthrix pattern on the cephalic peduncle and distribution of the vitelline follicles. Acanthobothrium domingae sp. n. is unique in the combination of proglottid apolysis, total length, number of proglottids, hook and septal morphology, microthrix pattern on the cephalic peduncle, number and distribution of testes, cirrus sac length, distribution of the vitelline follicles and genital pore position. The discovery of these species increases the number of species of Acanthobothrium parasitising rajifonn batoids off Argentina from one to three. All three species have a unique pattern of distribution of the gladiate spinitriches along the length of the cephalic peduncle, i.e., gladiate spinitriches being interrupted in a medial line both dorsally and ventrally.","[Franzese, Sebastian; Ivanov, Veronica A.] Univ Buenos Aires, Fac Ciencias Exactas & Nat, Dept Biodiversidad & Biol Expt, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Franzese, Sebastian; Ivanov, Veronica A.] Univ Buenos Aires, Inst Biodiversidad & Biol Expt & Aplicada IBBEA, CONICET, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina","Franzese, S (corresponding author), Univ Buenos Aires, Fac Ciencias Exactas & Nat, Inst Biodiversidad & Biol Expt & Aplicada IBBEA, CONICET UBA, Intendente Guiraldes 2160,Pabellon 2,Piso 4, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.",sefranze20@gmail.com,,,"Universidad de Buenos Aires (Argentina)University of Buenos Aires [UBACyT 20020130100617BA]; Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET, Argentina)Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET) [11220150100705]; Agencia Nacional de Promocion Cientifica y Tecnologica (Argentina)ANPCyT [20142358]","Thanks are due to Juan M.

There is, however, limited evidence of ecological responses to blue water MPAs. We conducted the first comprehensive evaluation of impacts on fisheries production and ecological responses to pelagic MPAs of the Pacific Remote Islands Marine National Monument. A Bayesian time series-based counterfactual modelling approach using fishery-dependent data was used to compare the temporal response in the MPAs to three reference regions for standardized catch rates, lengths, trophic level of the catch and species diversity. Catch rates of bigeye tuna, the main target species (Kingman/Palmyra MPA, causal effect probability >99% of an 84% reduction; 95% credible interval: -143%, -25%), and blue shark (Johnston MPAs, causal effect probability >95%) were significantly lower and longnose lancetfish significantly higher (Johnston MPAs, causal effect probability >95%) than predicted had the MPAs not been established, possibly from closing areas near shallow features, which aggregate pelagic predators, and from 'fishing-the-line'. There were no apparent causal impacts of the MPAs on species diversity, lengths and trophic level of the catch, perhaps because the MPAs were young, were too small, did not contain critical habitat for specific life-history stages, had been lightly exploited or experienced fishing-the-line. We also assessed model-standardized catch rates for species of conservation concern and mean trophic level of the catch within and outside of MPAs. Displaced effort produced multi-species conflicts: MPAs protect bycatch hotspots and hotspots of bycatch-to-target catch ratios for some at-risk species, but coldspots for others. Mean trophic level of the catch was significantly higher around MPAs, likely due to the aggregating effect of the shallow features and there having been light fishing pressure within MPAs. These findings demonstrate how exploring a wide range of ecological responses supports evidence-based evaluations of blue water MPAs.","[Gilman, Eric] Pelag Ecosyst Res Grp, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Gilman, Eric; Merrifield, Matt] Nature Conservancy, Honolulu, HI 96817 USA; [Chaloupka, Milani] Univ Queensland, Ecol Modelling Serv Pty Ltd, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Chaloupka, Milani] Univ Queensland, Marine Spatial Ecol Lab, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Fitchett, Mark] Western Pacific Reg Fishery Management Council, Honolulu, HI USA; [Cantrell, Danielle L.] US Fish & Wildlife Serv, Pacific Remote Isl Marine Natl Monument, Honolulu, HI USA","Gilman, E (corresponding author), Pelag Ecosyst Res Grp, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA.; Gilman, E (corresponding author), Nature Conservancy, Honolulu, HI 96817 USA.",FisheriesResearchGroup@gmail.com,,"Gilman, Eric/0000-0002-4216-2513",The Nature Conservancy; Western Pacific Regional Fishery Management Council,"This work received funding from The Nature Conservancy http://nature.org to EG and from the Western Pacific Regional Fishery Management Council http://www.wpcouncil.org/to MC.

Recent advances in the tracking of pelagic predators have revealed that these animals forage in the mesopelagic and the depth and duration of their foraging dives are affected by the presence of eddies. The ways in which eddies impact the distribution of mesopelagic micronekton, however, remain largely unknown. During a multi-seasonal experiment we used a shipboard scientific echosounder transmitting at 38 kHz to observe the distribution of acoustic backscattering in the energetic mesoscale eddy field of the northwestern Atlantic. Observations were collected at 24 stations with 6 located in anticyclonic and 7 in cyclonic eddies. The sampled anticyclonic eddies are characterized by intense acoustic backscattering in the mesopelagic and changes in the intensity of acoustic backscattering layers match gradients of surface properties. Furthermore, mesopelagic daytime backscattering is positively correlated with sea level anomaly. These results suggest that anticyclonic eddies in the northwestern Atlantic impact the distribution of mesopelagic micronekton and may have the potential to locally enhance or structure spatially mesopelagic communities.","[Della Penna, Alice; Gaube, Peter] Univ Washington, Appl Phys Lab, Air Sea Interact & Remote Sensing Dept, Seattle, WA 98105 USA; [Della Penna, Alice] Inst Univ Europeen Mer IUEM, Lab Sci Environm Marin LEMAR, UMR 6539, CNRS,Ifremer,IRD,UBO, Plouzane, France","Della Penna, A (corresponding author), Univ Washington, Appl Phys Lab, Air Sea Interact & Remote Sensing Dept, Seattle, WA 98105 USA.; Della Penna, A (corresponding author), Inst Univ Europeen Mer IUEM, Lab Sci Environm Marin LEMAR, UMR 6539, CNRS,Ifremer,IRD,UBO, Plouzane, France.",alice.dellapenna@gmail.com,,,Applied Physics Laboratory Science and Engineering Enrichment Development (SEED) fellowship; European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie grantEuropean Union (EU) [749591]; NASA Physical Oceanography ProgramNational Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); NASANational Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA) [NNX16AH59G],AD is grateful for the support of the Applied Physics Laboratory Science and Engineering Enrichment Development (SEED) fellowship and to the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie grant agreement no. 749591.

Despite this, little is known of its life-history or exploitation status. We provide the first estimates of crucial life-history parameters and the maximum intrinsic population growth rater(max), using specimens collected from small-scale fisheries landings in Kenya, Zanzibar and Madagascar (with northern Madagascar representing a range extension for this species). We assess the relative risk of overexploitation by combiningr(max)with estimates of totalZ, fishingF, and naturalMmortality, and an estimate of the exploitation ratioE. The data indicate that Baraka's whipray is a medium-sized, fast-growing, early maturing species, with a relatively long lifespan. This results in a highr(max)relative to many other elasmobranchs, which when combined with estimates ofFsuggests that the species is not at imminent risk of extinction. Yet, estimates of exploitation ratioEindicate likely overfishing for the species, with full recruitment to the fishery being post-maturation and exploitation occurring across a broad range of age and size classes. Thus, Baraka's whipray is unlikely to be biologically sustainable in the face of current fisheries pressures. This paper makes an important contribution to filling the gap in available data and is a step towards developing evidence-based fisheries management for this species. Further, it demonstrates a simple and widely applicable framework for assessment of data-poor elasmobranch exploitation status and extinction risk.","[Temple, Andrew J.; Stead, Selina M.; Barrowclift, Ellen; Berggren, Per] Newcastle Univ, Sch Nat & Environm Sci, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England; [Stead, Selina M.] Univ Stirling, Inst Aquaculture, Stirling, Scotland; [Jiddawi, Narriman] Dar Es Salaam Univ, Inst Marine Sci, Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania; [Jiddawi, Narriman] Minist Agr Nat Resources Livestock & Fisheries, Inst Fisheries Res Zanzibar, Stone Town, Zanzibar, Tanzania; [Wambiji, Nina] Kenya Marine & Fisheries Res Inst, Mombasa, Kenya; [Dulvy, Nicholas K.] Simon Fraser Univ, Earth Ocean Res Grp, Burnaby, BC, Canada","Temple, AJ (corresponding author), Newcastle Univ, Sch Nat & Environm Sci, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England.",andrew.temple@newcastle.ac.uk,,"Temple, Andrew/0000-0002-8516-8296",Western Indian Ocean Marine Science Association (WIOMSA) [MASMA/CP/2014/01],"This work was supported by the Western Indian Ocean Marine Science Association (WIOMSA) (Grant Number MASMA/CP/2014/01).

With characteristic dimensions less than 1 mm, the trapping structures are among the smallest known to capture prey by suction, a mechanism that is not effective in the creeping-flow regime where viscous forces prevent the generation of fast and energy-efficient suction flows. To understand what makes suction feeding possible on the small scale of bladderwort traps, we characterised their suction flows experimentally (using particle image velocimetry) and mathematically (using computational fluid dynamics and analytical mathematical models). We show that bladderwort traps avoid the adverse effects of creeping flow by generating strong, fast-onset suction pressures. Our findings suggest that traps use three morphological adaptations: the trap walls' fast release of elastic energy ensures strong and constant suction pressure; the trap door's fast opening ensures effectively instantaneous onset of suction; the short channel leading into the trap ensures undeveloped flow, which maintains a wide effective channel diameter. Bladderwort traps generate much stronger suction flows than larval fish with similar gape sizes because of the traps' considerably stronger suction pressures. However, bladderworts' ability to generate strong suction flows comes at considerable energetic expense.","[Mueller, Ulrike K.; Brown, Matthew D.] Calif State Univ Fresno, Dept Biol, 2555 E San Ramon Ave, Fresno, CA 93740 USA; [Berg, Otto] Calif State Univ Fresno, Dept Chem, 2555 E San Ramon Ave, Fresno, CA 93740 USA; [Schwaner, Janneke M.] Univ Idaho, Biol Sci, 875 Perimeter Dr MS 3051, Moscow, ID 83844 USA; [Li, Gen] Japan Agcy Marine Earth Sci & Technol JAMSTEC, Dept Math Sci & Adv Technol, Kanazawa Ku, Showa Machi, Yokohama, Kanagawa 31732523600, Japan; [Voesenek, Cees J.; van Leeuwen, Johan L.] Wageningen Univ, Expt Zool Grp, De Elst 1, NL-6708 WD Wageningen, Netherlands","Muller, UK (corresponding author), Calif State Univ Fresno, Dept Biol, 2555 E San Ramon Ave, Fresno, CA 93740 USA.",umuller@csufresno.edu,Li/O-7610-2019,"Li/0000-0002-4423-3266; Schwaner, M.

The sightings, behaviours, and pictures used for photographic identification were obtained during August to November 2012-2014 onboard tourist boats in Guadalupe Island, Mexico. Four types of baits were used: (1) frozen bait; (2) frozen bait and natural chum; (3) fresh fish bait; and (4) mackerel bags. Data were analysed according to sex, maturity and the total of sharks using 6,145 sightings of 121 white sharks. The type of bait showed no significant difference on the effectiveness to attracting sharks. Ethological analysis showed that the type of bait had a significant effect on the shark's surface behaviour during its interactions with boats. Natural chum and fresh baits showed short term behavioural patterns constituted by increased number of violent interactions with the bait, while the frozen bait did not generate a defined behavioural pattern. Conditioning of white sharks was determined by the number of interactions and the consumption frequency of the bait. Fifty nine percent of sharks (n=41) showed no conditioning, 36% (n=25) showed a low risk and only 5% (n=3) were found to have a high risk of conditioning. The results suggest that current ecotourism has no effect on the conditioning of the white sharks, and that all baits have a similar effectiveness for attracting the sharks. However, a different behavioural pattern was observed when fresh bait and chum were used, which could increase the potential of accidents during ecotourism.","[Becerril-Garcia, Edgar E.; Galvan-Magana, Felipe] Inst Politecn Nacl, Ctr Interdisciplinario Ciencias Marinas, La Paz 23096, Mexico; [Becerril-Garcia, Edgar E.; Hoyos-Padilla, Edgar M.] Pelagios Kakunja AC, La Paz 23060, Mexico; [Hoyos-Padilla, Edgar M.] Fins Attached Marine Res & Conservat, Colorado Springs, CO 80908 USA; [Micarelli, Primo] Sharks Studies Ctr, I-58024 Massa Marittima, Italy; [Sperone, Emilio] Univ Calabria, Dept Biol Ecol & Earth Sci, I-87036 Arcavacata Di Rende, Italy","Hoyos-Padilla, EM (corresponding author), Pelagios Kakunja AC, La Paz 23060, Mexico.; Hoyos-Padilla, EM (corresponding author), Fins Attached Marine Res & Conservat, Colorado Springs, CO 80908 USA.",mauricio@pelagioskakunja.org,,"Hoyos, Edgar/0000-0002-4318-2655",Instituto Politecnico Nacional from the Comision de Operacion y Fomento de Actividades Academicas; Estimulo al Desempeno de los Investigadores; Alianza WWF-Fundacion Telmex Telcel; Alianza WWF-Fundacion Carlos Slim; Fins Attached; University of Calabria; Charles Annenberg Foundation; Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y TecnologiaConsejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT); IDEA WILD,"The authors thank all the provided support from the ecotourism fleets who participated in this study, as well as Saul Gonzalez-Romero, Leonardo Trejo and Tom Lamphere.

Furthermore, little is known of the extent of spatial congruency between biodiversity measures in the marine realm. Here, we used the distribution maps of all known marine sharks, rays, and chimaeras (class Chondrichthyes) to examine the extent of spatial congruency across the hotspots of three measures of species richness: total number of species, evolutionarily distinct species, and endemic species. We assessed the spatial congruency between hotspots considering all species, as well as on the subset of the threatened species only. We consider three definitions of hotspot (2.5%, 5%, and 10% of cells with the highest numbers of species) and three levels of spatial resolution (1 degrees, 4 degrees, and 8 degrees grid cells). Overall, we found low congruency among all three measures of species richness, with the threatened species comprising a smaller subset of the overall species patterns irrespective of hotspot definition. Areas of congruency at 1 degrees and 5% richest cells contain over half (64%) of all sharks and rays and occurred off the coasts of: (1) Northern Mexico Gulf of California, (2) USA Gulf of Mexico, (3) Ecuador, (4) Uruguay and southern Brazil, (5) South Africa, southern Mozambique, and southern Namibia, (6) Japan, Taiwan, and parts of southern China, and (7) eastern and western Australia. Coarsening resolution increases congruency two-fold for all species but remains relatively low for threatened measures, and geographic locations of congruent areas also change. Finally, for pairwise comparisons of biodiversity measures, evolutionarily distinct species richness had the highest overlap with total species richness regardless of resolution or definition of hotspot. We suggest that focusing conservation attention solely on areas of high total species richness will not necessarily contribute efforts towards species that are most at risk, nor will it protect other important dimensions of species richness.","[Derrick, Danielle H.; Cheok, Jessica; Dulvy, Nicholas K.] Simon Fraser Univ, Earth Ocean Res Grp, Burnaby, BC, Canada","Derrick, DH (corresponding author), Simon Fraser Univ, Earth Ocean Res Grp, Burnaby, BC, Canada.",dhderric@sfu.ca,,,National Science and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; Shark and Ray Conservation Fund,This project was funded by the National Science and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) and the Shark and Ray Conservation Fund.,,71,1,1,4,4,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",1932-6203,,,PLOS ONE,PLoS One,Jul-06,2020,15,7,,,,,,,,10.1371/journal.pone.0235559; 10.1371/journal.pone.0235559.r001; 10.1371/journal.pone.0235559.r002; 10.1371/journal.pone.0235559.r003; 10.1371/journal.pone.0235559.r004; 10.1371/journal.pone.0235559.r005; 10.1371/journal.pone.0235559.r006,,,19,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,MM3OG,WOS:000550068700044,,"DOAJ Gold, Green Published",,,9/10/20

Design/methodology/approach - The unit cell antenna is constructed using a square ring radiator excited through a stepped impedance feed. The proposed antenna covers the Ultra-wideband (UWB) spectrum ranging from 2.2 to 12.3 GHz. The isolation between the unit cell antennas in the array is enhanced using a simple microstrip line resonator. The decoupling element is connected to the ground through a via. Findings - The proposed scheme offers at least 16 dB improvement in the port-to-port coupling. Furthermore, the four-element antenna array is constructed using a specific interlocking scheme. The proposed antenna array's Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) performance metrics are analyzed. Originality/value - By suitably selecting the excitation port, directional radiation patterns can be realized. The combined radiation pattern covers 360 degrees. A prototype antenna array is fabricated, and the simulation results are verified using real-time experiments. The proposed antenna is a suitable candidate for shark fin housing in automotive communications.","[Premalatha, J.; Sheela, D.] Tagore Engn Coll, Dept Elect & Commun Engn, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India","Premalatha, J (corresponding author), Tagore Engn Coll, Dept Elect & Commun Engn, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India.",joepremalatha@gmail.com; dsheelatagorerandd@gmail.com,,,,,,25,0,0,0,0,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0305-6120,1758-602X,,CIRCUIT WORLD,Circuit World,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1108/CW-04-2020-0055,,Jul-20,9,"Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Materials Science, Multidisciplinary",Engineering; Materials Science,MJ1KA,WOS:000547851800001,,,,,9/10/20

Given that capture-induced parturition (abortion or premature birth) is a common consequence of fisheries in elasmobranchs, but still little studied, we investigated how the abortion/premature birth process varies in response to reproductive traits in a freshwater stingray,Potamotrygon amandae. Our results revealed that capture-induced parturition was affected by reproductive traits, such as litter size (one to seven) and gestation stage. The event occurred faster in pregnant females with high litter size during late pregnancy. Also, as found in other elasmobranchs, litter size was positively correlated with maternal size. These findings indicate that larger pregnant females in late pregnancy are more vulnerable to capture-induced parturition. This study improves our understanding of the capture-induced parturition process in stingrays, and provides useful information for management strategies and future recommendations for elasmobranch conservation.","[de Sousa Rangel, Bianca; Moreira, Renata G.] Univ Sao Paulo, Lab Metab & Reprod Organismos Aquat, Inst Biociencias, Dept Fisiol, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [de Castro Ribeiro, Douglas] Univ Estadual Paulista, Inst Biociencias Letras & Ciencias Exatas, Lab Ictiol, Dept Zool & Bot, Rua Cristovao Colombo, Sao Jose Do Rio Preto, Brazil; [Chagas, Jumma M.

A promising HCV vaccine using chimpanzee adenoviral vectors (ChAd) encoding a genotype (gt) 1b non-structural protein (ChAd-Gt1b-NS) generated high magnitude T cell responses. However, these T cells showed reduced cross-recognition of dominant epitope variants and the vaccine has recently been shown to be ineffective at preventing chronic HCV. To address the challenge of viral diversity, we developed ChAd vaccines encoding HCV genomic sequences that are conserved between all major HCV genotypes and adjuvanted by truncated shark invariant chain (sli(tr)). Methods: Age-matched female mice were immunised intramuscularly with ChAd (10(8) infectious units) encoding gt-1 and -3 (ChAd-Gt1/3) or gt-1 to -6 (ChAd-Gt1-6) conserved segments spanning the HCV proteome, or gt-1b (ChAd-Gt1b-NS control), with immunogenicity assessed 14-days post-vaccination. Results: Conserved segment vaccines, ChAd-Gt1/3 and ChAd-Gt1-6, generated high-magnitude, broad, and functional CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cell responses. Compared to the ChAd-Gt1b-NS vaccine, these vaccines generated significantly greater responses against conserved non-gt-1 antigens, including conserved subdominant epitopes that were not targeted by ChAd-Gt1b-NS. Epitopes targeted by the conserved segment HCV vaccine induced T cells, displayed 96.6% mean sequence homology between all HCV subtypes (100% sequence homology for the majority of genotype-1, -2, -4 sequences and 94% sequence homology for gt-3, -6, -7, and -8) in contrast to 85.1% mean sequence homology for epitopes targeted by ChAd-Gt1b-NS induced T cells. The addition of truncated shark invariant chain (sli(tr)) increased the magnitude, breadth, and cross-reactivity of the T cell response. Conclusions: We have demonstrated that genetically adjuvanted ChAd vectored HCV T cell vaccines encoding genetic sequences conserved between genotypes are immunogenic, activating T cells that target subdominant conserved HCV epitopes. These pre-clinical studies support the use of conserved segment HCV T cell vaccines in human clinical trials.

We tested the effects of 72-hr exposure to OA-relevant elevated partial pressures of carbon dioxide (pCO(2)) on oxygen uptake rates, acid-base status, and haematology of newborn tropical blacktip reef sharks (Carcharhinus melanopterus). Acute exposure to end-of-centurypCO(2)levels resulted in elevated haematocrit (i.e. stress or compensation of oxygen uptake rates) and blood lactate concentrations (i.e. prolonged recovery) in the newborns. Conversely, whole blood and mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentrations, blood pH, estimates of standard and maximum metabolic rates, and aerobic scope remained unaffected. Taken together, newborn blacktip reef sharks appear physiologically robust to end-of-centurypCO(2)levels, but less so than other, previously investigated, tropical carpet sharks. Our results suggest peak fluctuatingpCO(2)levels in coral reef lagoons could still physiologically affect newborn reef sharks, but studies assessing the effects of long-term exposure and in combination with other anthropogenic stressors are needed.","[Rummer, Jodie L.; Bouyoucos, Ian A.] James Cook Univ, Australian Res Council Ctr Excellence Coral Reef, Townsville, Qld, Australia; [Bouyoucos, Ian A.; Mourier, Johann; Nakamura, Nao; Planes, Serge] Univ Perpignan, PSL Res Univ, EPHE UPVD CNRS, USR 3278, Perpignan, France; [Mourier, Johann; Nakamura, Nao; Planes, Serge] CRIOBE, Lab Excellence CORAIL, Moorea, French Polynesi, France; [Mourier, Johann] Univ Montpellier, CNRS, IFREMER, UMR MARBEC,IRD, Sete, France","Rummer, JL (corresponding author), James Cook Univ, Australian Res Council Ctr Excellence Coral Reef, Townsville, Qld, Australia.",jodie.rummer@jcu.edu.au,"Bouyoucos, Ian/E-6392-2017; Mourier, Johann/B-4881-2012; Rummer, Jodie/A-6524-2015","Bouyoucos, Ian/0000-0002-4267-1043; Mourier, Johann/0000-0001-9019-1717; Rummer, Jodie/0000-0001-6067-5892","Australian Research Council (ARC)Australian Research Council [PDE150101266]; L'Oreal-United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) Women in Science Foundation; Institut des Recifs Coralliens du Pacifique Fellowship; ARC Super Science FellowshipAustralian Research Council; James Cook University Postgraduate Research Scholarship; Institute for Research and Development postdoctoral fellowship; ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef StudiesAustralian Research Council; Laboratoire d'Excellence CORAIL; Station d'Ecologie Experimentale of the CRIOBE; French Ministere de l'Environnement","The authors thank the staff and technicians at the CRIOBE as well as Peter Edmunds and Steve Doo (University of California GUMP Research Station, Moorea) and Sue-Ann Watson (Queensland Museum, Australia) and Philip Munday (James Cook University) for help with CO<INF>2</INF> analyses.

As they are large predators occupying the highest levels of marine food webs, their removal can alter the trophic web dynamic through predatory release effects and trophic cascade. Suitable management of threatened shark species requires a good understanding of their behaviour and feeding ecology. In this study we provide one of the first assessments of the trophic ecology of the vulnerable smooth-hounds Mustelus mustelus and M. punctulatus in the Central Mediterranean Sea, based on stomach contents and stable isotope analyses. Ontogenetic diet changes were addressed by comparing the feeding habits of three groups of individuals: juveniles, maturing and adults. Our results highlighted that the two species share a similar diet based mostly on the consumption of benthic crustaceans (e.g. hermit crabs). Their trophic level increases during ontogeny, with adults increasing their consumption of large-sized crustaceans (e.g. Calappa granulata, Palinurus elephas), cephalopods (e.g. Octopus vulgaris) and fish (e.g. Trachurus trachurus). Our results provide also evidence of ontogenetic shifts in diet for both species showing a progressive reduction of interspecific trophic overlap during growth. The results of this study contribute to improve the current knowledge on the trophic ecology of these two threatened sharks in the Strait of Sicily, thus providing a better understanding of their role in the food web.","[Di Lorenzo, Manfredi] Natl Res Council IRBIM CNR, Inst Biol Resources & Marine Biotechnol, Via Luigi Vaccara 61, I-91026 Mazara Del Vallo, TP, Italy; [Vizzini, Salvatrice; Signa, Geraldina; Andolina, Cristina] Natl Interuniv Consortium Marine Sci, CoNISMa, Piazzale Flaminio 9, I-00196 Rome, Italy; [Vizzini, Salvatrice; Signa, Geraldina; Andolina, Cristina] Univ Palermo, Dept Earth & Marine Sci, Via Archirafi 18, I-90123 Palermo, Italy; [Palo, Gabriele Boscolo; Mazzoldi, Carlotta] Univ Padua, Dept Biol, Via Ugo Bassi 58-B, I-35131 Padua, Italy; [Gristina, Michele] Natl Res Council IAS CNR, Inst Anthrop Impacts & Sustainabil Marine Environ, Via G da Verrazzano 17, I-91014 Castellammare Del Golfo, TP, Italy; [Colloca, Francesco] Integrat Marine Ecol Dept, Anton Dohrn Zool Stn, Via Po 25, I-00198 Rome, Italy; [Colloca, Francesco] Sapienza Univ Rome, Dept Biol & Biotechnol Charles Darwin, Rome, Italy","Di Lorenzo, M (corresponding author), Natl Res Council IRBIM CNR, Inst Biol Resources & Marine Biotechnol, Via Luigi Vaccara 61, I-91026 Mazara Del Vallo, TP, Italy.",manfredi.dilorenzo@libero.it,"Mazzoldi, Carlotta/AAU-8628-2020; Signa, Geraldina/G-3357-2017","Di Lorenzo, Manfredi/0000-0003-3786-5772; Signa, Geraldina/0000-0003-2171-3299",RitMare Project (Italian Project); Italian National Programme on Halieutic Data Collection (PNRDA),"The authors are grateful to E.A.

The question of whether Australian estuaries have a Hg contamination problem is addressed. The Hg concentrations in fish, excluding sharks, tuna, barramundi and some stingrays, in estuaries and near-shore ecosystems with no discernable pollution sources are typically below 0.5 mg/kg wet weight, the level of health concern. There is no relationship of Hg concentration with fish size or age nor any evidence of biomagnification. In locations with historic large discrete Hg input sources (e.g. Derwent Estuary, Tasmania, Princess Royal Harbour WA, Port Phillip Bay Vic, Sydney sewage outfalls NSW), Hg concentrations in some sediment-dwelling fish such as flatheads exceed the health limit of 0.5 mg/kg. In this paper, we also review, within an Australian context, the biogeochemical processes controlling the formation and accumulation of methyl mercury (MeHg). On entering waterways, Hg rapidly partitions to particulate matter and deposits into sediments. The remobilisation of Hg from sediment is dependent on the formation of MeHg by bacteria and ultimately the interplay of 5, Fe and Se cycling. Fish species that move and feed in different areas have Hg concentrations that do not reflect the sediment Hg concentrations where they are caught, i.e. there is an uncoupling of diet and potential Hg exposure. Concluding remarks focus on management interventions: source reduction, preventing eutrophication and promoting system biodiversity and biodiverse diets to mediate the accumulation of Hg in marine organisms and limit the intake of Hg by humans when consuming fish.","[Maher, William; Krikowa, Frank; Ellwood, Michael] Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Earth Sci, Biogeochem Grp, Canberra, ACT, Australia","Maher, W (corresponding author), Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Earth Sci, Biogeochem Grp, Canberra, ACT, Australia.",William.Maher@anu.edu.au,,,,,,101,0,0,4,4,UNIV CALIFORNIA PRESS,OAKLAND,"155 GRAND AVE, SUITE 400, OAKLAND, CA 94612-3758 USA",2325-1026,,,ELEMENTA-SCI ANTHROP,Elementa-Sci.

Detailed measurements of their length show that they are exceptionally long and unusually continuous. The Great Southern Scarp is the southern edge of the Nullarbor Plain's Bunda Plateau; it is cut into shallow marine sediments and extends for 820 km. Once a continuous sea-cliff, local uplift has isolated two sections from the ocean, so it now comprises the Bunda Cliffs (210 km of coastal cliff, 180 km of which is uninterrupted cliff line), Hampton Range (inland; 300 km), Baxter Cliffs (160 km of coastal cliff) and Wylie Scarp (inland; 160 km). The Zuytdorp Cliffs are coastal cliffs cut into eolianite, and extend for 210 km with an uninterrupted section of 120 km. The length of the Great Southern Scarp and the Zuytdorp Cliffs results from an unusual combination of circumstances. They are both composed of poorly jointed, relatively homogenous biogenic calcarenites, presented to high-energy ocean waves by regional uplift. The carbonates are sufficiently well cemented to maintain a steep vertical cliff face, but susceptible to disintegration under direct wave attack. Cliff retreat has been fairly uniform because of the broad spatial scale of both lithology and erosion. The arid climate, absence of nearby nonkarstic catchments and karstic nature of the cliffs' hinterlands has discouraged integrated drainage development, so no significant fluvial systems dissect the cliffs; this is a key factor in cliff edge preservation. In the case of the Great Southern Scarp, these processes have formed the longest continuous cliff line in Australia and probably the world. Referenced against criteria from Australia's National Heritage List, the cliffs have potentially international/national levels of significance for the rarity of their scale, their demonstration of landscape evolution, and their spectacular beauty.","[Wakelin-King, G.

This group of cartilaginous fishes first occurred during the early Palaeozoic Era as revealed from the fossil record and were long thought to have gone extinct at the Permian-Triassic mass extinction event. However, a recently reported chondrichthyan tooth assemblage from the Early Cretaceous of France suggests that cladodontomorphs might have survived the catastrophic events at the Permian-Triassic boundary, probably by occupying deep-sea refuge environments. Here, we describe two new chondrichthyan genera based on isolated teeth recovered from Valanginian (Early Cretaceous) deep-water deposits of Austria, including a total of three new species tentatively assigned to the cladodontomorph families Falcatidae (Cretacladoides ogiveformisgen. et sp. nov. andC. noricumsp. nov.) and Ctenacanthidae (Natarapax trivortexgen. et sp. nov.). In addition, an enameloid microstructure analysis had led to the identification of a distinct multilayered enameloid including a parallel-, tangled-, and radial-bundled enameloid, whose phylogenetic distribution within Chondrichthyes is here discussed in detail, leading to the conclusion that the herein described cladodont-like taxa, together with those reported from the French Early Cretaceous might be closely related to ancient Palaeozoic taxa.

The Pacific spiny dogfish can experience and tolerate reduced environmental salinities, yet how this environmental challenge may affect the microbiome, and consequently nitrogen transport across the gut, is as of yet unknown. In the present study, excised gut sac preparations were made from dogfish acclimated to the following: full-strength seawater (C), low salinity for 7 days (LS), and after acute transfer of LS-acclimated fish to full-strength SW for 6 h (AT). Significantly reduced microbial derived urease activity was observed in the mucosal saline of gut sac preparations from the LS (by 81%) and AT (by 89%) treatments relative to the C treatment. Microbial derived cellulase activity from mucosal saline samples tended to follow similar patterns. To further ensure an effective decrease in the spiral valve microbial population, an antibiotic cocktail was applied to the mucosal saline used for in vitro measurements of ion, water, and nitrogen flux in these gut sac preparations. This caused a further 57-61% decrease in the mucosal saline urease activity of the C and LS treatments. Overall, we observed relatively little flux across the stomach for all measured parameters aside from water movement, which switched from a net efflux in control fish to a net influx in acutely transferred fish, indicative of drinking. While no significant differences were observed in terms of nitrogen flux (urea or ammonia), we tended to see the accumulation of ammonia in the spiral valve lumen and a switch from efflux to influx of urea in control versus acutely transferred fish. The increased ammonia production likely occurs as a result of heightened metabolism in a challenging environment, while the retention and acquisition of urea is suggestive of nitrogen scavenging under nitrogen-limiting conditions.","[Weinrauch, Alyssa M.; Anderson, W.

Nonetheless, knowledge about myosin heavy chain (MyHC) in the atrioventricular myocardium remains scarce. The present report is the first one to provide data on the MyHC isoform distribution in the myocardium of the atrioventricular junction in chondrichthyans, specifically in the lesser spotted dogfish,Scyliorhinus canicula, a shark species whose heart reflects the primitive cardiac anatomical design in gnathostomes. Hearts from five dogfish were examined using histochemical and immunohistochemical techniques. The anti-MyHC A4.1025 antibody was used to detect differences in the occurrence of MyHC isoforms in the dogfish, as the fast-twitch isoforms MYH2 and MYH6 have a higher affinity for this antibody than the slow-twitch isoforms MYH7 and MYH7B. The histochemical findings show that myocardium of the atrioventricular junction connects the trabeculated myocardium of the atrium with the trabeculated layer of the ventricular myocardium. The immunohistochemical results indicate that the distribution of MyHC isoforms in the atrioventricular junction is not homogeneous. The atrial portion of the atrioventricular myocardium shows a positive reactivity against the A4.1025 antibody similar to that of the atrial myocardium. In contrast, the ventricular portion of the atrioventricular junction is not labelled, as is the case with the ventricular myocardium. This dual condition suggests that the myocardium of the atrioventricular junction has two contraction patterns: the myocardium of the atrial portion contracts in line with the atrial myocardium, whereas that of the ventricular portion follows the contraction pattern of the ventricular myocardium. Thus, the transition of the contraction wave from the atrium to the ventricle may be established in the atrioventricular segment because of its heterogeneous MyHC isoform distribution. The findings support the hypothesis that a distinct MyHC isoform distribution in the atrioventricular myocardium enables a synchronous contraction of inflow and outflow cardiac segments in vertebrates lacking a specialized cardiac conduction system.","[Lopez-Unzu, Miguel A.; Teresa Soto-Navarrete, Maria; Sans-Coma, Valentin; Fernandez, Borja; Carmen Duran, Ana] Univ Malaga, Fac Ciencias, Dept Biol Anim, Malaga 29071, Spain; [Lopez-Unzu, Miguel A.; Teresa Soto-Navarrete, Maria; Sans-Coma, Valentin; Fernandez, Borja; Carmen Duran, Ana] Inst Biomed Malaga IBIMA, Malaga, Spain; [Fernandez, Borja; Carmen Duran, Ana] Inst Biotecnol & Desarralla Azul IBYDA, Malaga, Spain","Duran, AC (corresponding author), Univ Malaga, Fac Ciencias, Dept Biol Anim, Malaga 29071, Spain.",acduran@uma.es,"Lopez-Unzu, Miguel A./B-5911-2017","Lopez-Unzu, Miguel A./0000-0002-8538-0713","FEDER FundsEuropean Union (EU); Ministerio de Ciencia e InnovacionInstituto de Salud Carlos IIISpanish Government [CGL2017-85090-P, FPU15/03209, PRE2018-083176]","FEDER Funds; Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion, Grant/Award Numbers: CGL2017-85090-P, FPU15/03209, PRE2018-083176",,32,0,0,0,0,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-1112,1095-8649,,J FISH BIOL,J.

In this study, we aimed to fabricate a biologically functional ECM powder suspension from porcine articular cartilage that inhibits neovascularization (NV). Methods: The digested-cartilage acellular matrix (dg-CAM) was prepared by sequential processes of decellularization, enzymatic digestion and pulverization. Physicochemical properties of dg-CAM were compared with that of native cartilage tissue (NCT). Cellular interactions between human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and dg-CAM was evaluated with proliferation, migration and tube formation assays compared with that of type I collagen (COL) and bevacizumab, an anti-angiogenic drug. We then investigated the therapeutic potential of topical administration of dg-CAM suspension on the experimentally induced rabbit corneal NV model. Results: The dg-CAM released a significantly larger amount of soluble proteins than that of the NCT and showed an improved hydrophilic and dispersion properties. In contrast, the dg-CAM contained a large amount of collagen, glycosaminoglycans and anti-angiogenic molecules as much as the NCT. The inhibitory effect on NV of the dg-CAM was more prominent than that of COL and even comparable to that of bevacizumab in inhibiting the HUVECs. The therapeutic potential of the dg-CAM was comparable to that of bevacizumab in the rabbit corneal NV model by efficiently inhibiting neovessel formation of the injured cornea. Conclusion: The current study developed a dg-CAM having anti-angiogenic properties, together with water-dispersible properties suitable for topical or minimally invasive application for prevention of vessel invasion.","[Yun, Hee-Woong; Min, Byoung-Hyun] Ajou Univ, Dept Mol Sci & Technol, San 5, Suwon 16499, South Korea; [Yun, Hee-Woong; Min, Byoung-Hyun] Ajou Univ, Cell Therapy Ctr, Sch Med, San 5, Suwon 16499, South Korea; [Choi, Byung Hyune] Inha Univ, Dept Biomed Sci, Coll Med, 100 Inha Ro, Incheon 22212, South Korea; [Park, Do Young; Min, Byoung-Hyun] Ajou Univ, Dept Orthoped Surg, Sch Med, San 5, Suwon 16499, South Korea; [Jin, Long Hao] Yanbian Univ, Dept Orthoped Surg, Sch Med, 977 Gongyuan Rd, Yanji, Yanbian, Peoples R China","Min, BH (corresponding author), Ajou Univ, Dept Mol Sci & Technol, San 5, Suwon 16499, South Korea.; Min, BH (corresponding author), Ajou Univ, Cell Therapy Ctr, Sch Med, San 5, Suwon 16499, South Korea.; Min, BH (corresponding author), Ajou Univ, Dept Orthoped Surg, Sch Med, San 5, Suwon 16499, South Korea.",bhmin@ajou.ac.kr,,,"Korea Health Technology RD Project [HI14C0744, HI17C2191]; Korea Health Industry Development Institute - Ministry of Health Welfare",This study was supported by a grant from the Korea Health Technology R&D Project (HI14C0744 and HI17C2191) through the Korea Health Industry Development Institute funded by the Ministry of Health & Welfare.,,57,0,0,3,3,KOREAN TISSUE ENGINEERING REGENERATIVE MEDICINE SOC,SEOCHO-GU,"1414 SEOCHO WORLD OFFICETEL 19, SEOUN-RO, SEOCHO-GU, SEOUL 06732, SOUTH KOREA",1738-2696,2212-5469,,TISSUE ENG REGEN MED,Tissue Eng.

This stain exhibits high rates of penetration and results in excellent contrast between and within soft tissues, including the central nervous system. Here, we present a staining method for optimizing contrast in the brain of a cartilaginous fish, the brownbanded bamboo shark, Chiloscyllium punctatum, and a bony fish, the common goldfish, Carassius auratus, using diceCT. The aim of this optimization procedure is to provide suitable contrast between neural tissue and background tissue(s) of the head, thereby facilitating digital segmentation and volumetric analysis of the central nervous system. Both species were scanned before staining and were rescanned at time (T) intervals, either every 48 h (C. punctatum) or every 24 h (C. auratus), to assess stain penetration and contrast enhancement. To compare stain intensities, raw X-ray CT data were reconstructed using air and water calibration phantoms that were scanned under identical conditions to the samples.

It was observed that male sharks of Scoliodon laticaudus Muller & Henle, 1838 and Rhizoprionodon acutus (Ruppell, 1837) landed along a few centres of Gujarat coast, have highly calcified claspers which morphologically resembled ossified webbed foot. The morphological and anatomical study revealed that the terminal end of the clasper has been modified into an umbrella like organ called rhipidion which probably ensures that the clasper stays within the cloaca of the female until the sperm is delivered. The landed sharks were all mature. This recent observation of catch of many mature individuals near the coastal waters throws some light on the breeding season and breeding area of sharks along Gujarat coast. With episodes of extinction and threat to the existence of several species of sharks today, this reproductive adaptation of the sharks might helps them to survive and sustain adverse conditions.","[Sen, S.; Dash, G.] Cent Marine Fisheries Res Inst, Digha Res Ctr, Ramnagar 721441, W Bengal, India; [Kizhakudan, S.

This is a transition zone between warm tropical waters cold regions, which reflects in the great species diversity, including rare occurrences and endemism. Therefore, the aim of this study is to describe the composition and conservation status of elasmobranchs that occurs in state of the Rio Grande do Sul, south Brazil, through a detailed literature review and review lists of species deposited in regional, national and international collections. In total, 94 species were recorded (60.6% of Brazil elasmobranch biodiversity and 8% of the world), with 11 new records compared to the most recent study, distributed into 10 orders and 30 families. A total of 58 species of sharks were listed, most of them belonging to the order Carcharhiniformes (41.4%), followed by Squaliformes (27.6%), and 36 rays mainly of the orders Rajiformes (50.0%) and Myliobatiformes (30.5%). Concerning their conservation status, 26.6, 38.3 and 45.8% of the species are threatened (CR, EN, VU), at the regional, national and international levels, respectively. The intense fishing effort may be the main responsible for these results. Resumption of landings monitoring, inclusion of local ecological knowledge of fishermen, taxonomic and molecular identification of carcasses, are suggested as mitigating strategies.

This group was later redefined as the Squalomorphi, which included Squatinidae but not Batoidea. Subsequent morphological analyses, however, rejected Maisey's scheme, which was left aside for nearly two decades until the first molecular phylogenies began to cluster again the orbitostylic sharks into a monophyletic group. In a broad comparative investigation of the anatomy of the appendicular skeleton of cartilaginous fishes, we discovered new evidence supporting the monophyly of squalomorph sharks: the presence of a posterior process at the lateral region of the coracoid bar serving as a origin site for the depressor pectoralis II muscle. This feature would be the first strong morphological evidence in 40 years potentially supporting the monophyly of Squalomorphi. (c) 2020 Elsevier GmbH.

Balancing these objectives is made more complex in the case of multispecies and multigear fisheries. In this paper, we develop a bioeconomic model that captures the key elements of such a fishery to test a range of potential harvest strategies to provide insights into how economic target reference points could lead to both desirable and undesirable management outcomes (e.g. discards). The model is developed as a long-run optimisation model to identify target reference points to achieve multispecies maximum economic yield, and a dynamic recursive optimisation model, which includes more realistic representation of fishers' behaviour, such as discards and trading of under-caught species quotas. The potential economic, social and ecological impacts are evaluated using data envelopment analysis (DEA). The results suggest that the use of proxy target reference points can result in short-term economic benefits at the cost of slower stock recovery and higher discarding. Limiting the number of species subject to quota controls may also prove beneficial in multispecies fisheries, while ensuring quota markets are efficient is likely to produce benefits irrespective of the harvest strategy adopted.","[Pascoe, Sean; Hutton, Trevor] CSIRO Oceans & Atmosphere, 306 Carmody Rd, St Lucia, Qld 4067, Australia; [Hoshino, Eriko; Sporcic, Miriana] CSIRO Oceans & Atmosphere, Hobart, Tas, Australia; [Yamasaki, Satoshi] Univ Tasmania, Tasmanian Sch Business & Econ, Hobart, Tas, Australia; [Kompas, Tom] Univ Melbourne, Sch Biosci, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Kompas, Tom] Univ Melbourne, Sch Ecosyst & Forest Sci, Melbourne, Vic, Australia","Pascoe, S (corresponding author), CSIRO Oceans & Atmosphere, 306 Carmody Rd, St Lucia, Qld 4067, Australia.",sean.pascoe@csiro.au,"Pascoe, Sean/D-9710-2011; Yamazaki, Satoshi/J-7538-2014","Pascoe, Sean/0000-0001-6581-2649; Yamazaki, Satoshi/0000-0003-1279-2706",,,,62,0,0,0,0,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1364-985X,1467-8489,,AUST J AGR RESOUR EC,Aust.

Besides, the relationship between local skin-friction along the riblet spanwise and associated vortex evolution was also built using the vortex dynamic method. Based on these results , it was found that, compared with the smooth case , the impaired and enhanced vortex strength , and resultant viscous diffusion/energy dissipation , determined the reduction and augment of the viscous drag force over the local spanwise riblet groove , i.e. , decreasing and increasing cases of local drag , respectively. Furthermore , the mean normal diffusion fluxes of normal and spanwise vorticities contributed more to the viscous drag under these tw o cases. Correspondingly, the relevant flow physics related to these phenomena was discussed in detail.","[Zhang, M. M.; Zhang, Z.

The hypothesis of the paper is inspired by the simplification of the dermal denticle on the surface of the shark-skin. Simulations are carried out using the Transition SST model in FLUENT based on the evidences of the transition model being suitable for a wider variety of high curvature scenarios. The surface waves are simulated for different amplitudes and wavelengths and their impact on transition onset and drag reduction are quantified at different velocities. Results presented in this paper indicate that a transition delay of 10.8% and a drag reduction of 5.2% are achievable.

This phenomenon is already shown to significantly impact marine ecosystems and respective fauna. While experimental acclimation to higher temperatures is known to affect predatory behavior, metabolism and overall fitness of sharks, the effects of short-term exposure to high temperatures on sharks' physiology has yet to be investigated in a MHW context. Thus, the aim of our work was to study the impact of a category II MHW (Delta 3 degrees C, 15 days) on: i) hematological parameters (total erythrocytes, leukocytes, thrombocytes, erythrocyte nuclear abnormalities (ENAs) counts, and nucleus to cytoplasmic ratio), ii) heart and spleen to body ratios, and iii) ventilation rates of juvenile catsharks (Scyliorhinus canicula). We found that MHW exposure led to significant changes in normal blood cell counts, by lowering erythrocyte counts and nucleus to cytoplasm ratio, and increasing leukocyte and thrombocyte counts. Moreover, ventilation rates increased consistently over the course of the MHW. However, there were no changes regarding the presence of ENA, as well as spleen and heart to body ratios. Our findings indicate limited capabilities for coping with sudden warming events, suggesting potential disruption in shark physiological homeostasis as the frequency, duration and intensity of MHWs are expected to be strengthened.","[Pegado, Maria Rita; Santos, Catarina P.; Sampaio, Eduardo; Maulvault, Ana Luisa; Rosa, Rui] Univ Lisbon, MARE Marine & Environm Sci Ctr, Lab Maritimo Guia, Fac Ciencias, Ave Nossa Senhora Cabo 939, P-2750374 Cascais, Portugal; [Maulvault, Ana Luisa; Diniz, Mario] Univ Nova Lisboa, Fac Ciencias & Tecnol, Dept Quim, UCIBIO,REQUIMTE, P-2829516 Caparica, Portugal; [Raffoul, Dayanne] Univ Milano Bicocca, Milan, Italy; [Konieczna, Marta] Univ Gdansk, Fac Oceanog & Geog, Gdansk, Poland; [Sampaio, Eduardo] Univ Konstanz, Max Planck Inst Anim Behav, Dept Collect Behav, Constance, Germany; [Sampaio, Eduardo] Univ Konstanz, Ctr Adv Study Collect Behav, Constance, Germany","Pegado, MR (corresponding author), Univ Lisbon, MARE Marine & Environm Sci Ctr, Lab Maritimo Guia, Fac Ciencias, Ave Nossa Senhora Cabo 939, P-2750374 Cascais, Portugal.",mrpegado@fc.ul.pt,"; Santos, Catarina/O-3708-2015; Rosa, Rui/A-4580-2009","Sampaio, Eduardo/0000-0002-9222-2553; Santos, Catarina/0000-0001-6526-4291; Rosa, Rui/0000-0003-2801-5178","Fundacao para a Ciencia e Tecnologia (FCT)Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology [UID/MAR/04292/2013, PTDC/AAG-GLO/1926/2014]; FCTPortuguese Foundation for Science and Technology [SFRH/BD/111691/2015, SFRH/BD/117890/2016, SFRH/BD/131771/2017, PTDC/BIA-BMA/28630/2017]","This work was supported by Fundacao para a Ciencia e Tecnologia (FCT), through the strategic project UID/MAR/04292/2013 granted to MARE, a project grant PTDC/AAG-GLO/1926/2014 to RR.

The aim of this work is to report visible alive plerocercoids in longfin inshore squid (Doryteuthis pealeii), a cephalopod species commercialized as fresh and whole in Italy. Seventy D. pealeii from the Northwest Atlantic (FAO area 21) were collected and visually inspected. In total, 18 plerocercoid larvae were found in the viscera of 10 host specimens (P: 14.3% 95% CI 7.1-24.7; MI: 1.8, MA: 0.26; range 1-4) and molecularly analyzed targeting the variable D2 region of the large subunit (LSU) rRNA gene and the cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) gene. The molecular characterization allowed to identify all the plerocercoids as Clistobothrium sp., a cestode of the Phyllobothriidae family with Lamnidae sharks as definitive hosts, and cephalopods as second intermediate hosts. These findings represent the first molecular record of Clistobothrium sp. in D. pealeii, thus contributing to elucidate its poorly known life cycle. Even if not affecting consumer's health, these visible parasites may represent a reason for disgust for consumers. Therefore, the results suggest that Food Business Operators should also check for the presence of these visible parasites during inspection and underline the importance of a correct consumers' education.","[Guardone, Lisa; Giusti, Alice; Armani, Andrea] Univ Pisa, Dept Vet Sci, I-56124 Pisa, Italy; [Bilska-Zajac, Ewa; Rozycki, Miroslaw] Natl Vet Res Inst, Dept Parasitol & Invas Dis, PL-24100 Pulawy, Poland; [Malandra, Renato] ASL Milan, Wholesale Fish Market Milan, I-20137 Milan, Italy","Guardone, L (corresponding author), Univ Pisa, Dept Vet Sci, I-56124 Pisa, Italy.",lisa.guardone@for.unipi.it; alice.giusti183@outlook.it; ewa.bilska@piwet.pulawy.pl; RMalandra@ats-milano.it; mrozycki@piwet.pulawy.pl; andrea.armani@unipi.it,,,University of Pisa,"This research was funded by the 2019 Visiting Fellow Program of the University of Pisa, which financed a period of research of Ewa Bilska-Zajac at the FishLab, Department of Veterinary Science, University of Pisa.",,59,0,0,0,0,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2076-0817,,PATHOGENS,Pathogens,JUL,2020,9,7,,,,,,,596,10.3390/pathogens9070596,,,17,Microbiology,Microbiology,MW7UZ,WOS:000557238100001,32708325,"DOAJ Gold, Green Published",,,9/10/20

However, acquiring continuous steady image sequences is a very challenging task for bionic robotic fish due to their tight internal space and the inherent periodic disturbance caused by the tail beating. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a modified stabilization strategy that combines mechanical devices and digital image techniques to enhance the visual sensor stability and resist periodic disturbance. More specifically, an improved window function-based linear active disturbance rejection control (LADRC) was utilized for mechanical stabilization. Furthermore, a rapid algorithm with inertial measurement units (IMUs) was implemented for digital stabilization. The experiments regarding mechanical stabilization, digital stabilization, and target recognition on the experimental platform for simulating fishlike oscillations demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed methods. The success of these experiments provides valuable insight into the construction of underwater visual sensing systems and also establishes a solid foundation for the visual applications for robotic fish in dynamic aquatic environments.","[Pan, Jie; Liu, Jincun; Yu, Junzhi] Peking Univ, Coll Engn, BIC ESAT, Dept Mech & Engn Sci,State Key Lab Turbulence & C, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Pengfei] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Automat, State Key Lab Management & Control Complex Syst, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Pengfei] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Sch Artificial Intelligence, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China","Yu, JZ (corresponding author), Peking Univ, Coll Engn, BIC ESAT, Dept Mech & Engn Sci,State Key Lab Turbulence & C, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China.",panjie@pku.edu.cn; zhangpengfei2017@ia.ac.cn; liujincun@pku.edu.cn; yujunzhi@pku.edu.cn,"Yu, Junzhi/A-7876-2010","Yu, Junzhi/0000-0002-6347-572X","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [U1909206, 61903007, 61725305, 61633017]; Pre-Research Fund of Equipment of China [61402070304]; China Postdoctoral Science FoundationChina Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2020M670044]; Key Research and Development and Transformation Project of Qinghai Province [2017-GX-103]","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos.

In order to inform management, pop-up satellite archival tags (PSATs) were deployed on dolphinfish (Coryphaena hippurus) in the Northern East China Sea to get data on the movement patterns and habitat utilization of this species in this location. During October-November 2018, four dolphinfish (94-102 cm fork length) were captured by set-nets and PSAT tagged. Tagged dolphinfish retained PSATs for 5-31 days-at-liberty (total 69 days) and linear dispersion from deployment to pop-up locations ranged from 63 to 204 km. According to most probable tracks, tagged fish made primarily northward movements. Tagged fish reached depths of similar to 94 m and experienced ambient temperatures from 17.8 to 23 degrees C. Movements appeared to be limited by a 3 degrees C change relative to sea surface temperature (SST) and were confined to the mixed-layer. Diel diving patterns indicated dolphinfish spent >80% of daytime activity and 40% of nighttime activity near the surface, where variability in diving patterns was more pronounced. The vertical diving patterns showed pronounced changes during dawn and dusk, where dolphinfish mirrored the movements of diel migrating prey organisms. Our preliminary results provide vertical distribution patterns of dolphinfish in a location that supports important fisheries. This information will be useful for management to develop stock assessments which support the sustainable use of this species.","[Lin, Shian-Jhong; Chiang, Wei-Chuan; Chang, Qi-Xuan; Ho, Yuan-Shing] Fisheries Res Inst, Eastern Marine Biol Res Ctr, 22 Wuchuan Rd, Taitung 961, Taiwan; [Lin, Shian-Jhong; Wang, Sheng-Ping; Su, Nan-Jay] Natl Taiwan Ocean Univ, Dept Environm Biol & Fishery Sci, 2 Beining Rd, Keelung 202, Taiwan; [Musyl, Michael K.] Pelag Res Grp LLC, POB 10243, Honolulu, HI 96816 USA; [Nakamura, Itsumi; Kawabe, Ryo] Nagasaki Univ, Inst East China Sea Res, Org Marine Sci & Technol, 551-7 Taira Machi, Nagasaki 8512213, Japan; [Tseng, Chen-Te] Fisheries Res Inst, 199 Hou Ih Rd, Keelung 202, Taiwan","Chiang, WC (corresponding author), Fisheries Res Inst, Eastern Marine Biol Res Ctr, 22 Wuchuan Rd, Taitung 961, Taiwan.",20231001@mail.ntou.edu.tw; wcchiang@mail.tfrin.gov.tw; Michael.Musyl@gmail.com; wsp@mail.ntou.edu.tw; nanjay@ntou.edu.tw; chchang03@mail.tfrin.gov.tw; yuanho18@gmail.com; itsumola@gmail.com; cttseng@mail.tfrin.gov.tw; flatfish68@gmail.com,,"Su, Nan-Jay/0000-0003-1370-0842","Fisheries Research Institute, council to Agriculture, Taiwan [107AS-9.2.2-A1(2), 108AS-9.2.2-A1(5)]","This study was partially funded by the Fisheries Research Institute, council to Agriculture, Taiwan [grant nos. 107AS-9.2.2-A1(2) and 108AS-9.2.2-A1(5)].",,55,0,0,1,1,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,JUL,2020,12,14,,,,,,,5793,10.3390/su12145793,,,16,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,MU8TA,WOS:000555938700001,,DOAJ Gold,,,9/10/20

Living microbial mats and fossil microbialites associated with older paleoshorelines have been studied in the continental Maquinchao Basin in southernmost South America. Here, we investigate carbonate crusts from a former pond where active mineralizing microbial mats have been previously studied. Petrographic observations revealed the presence of abundant erect and nonerect microfilaments and molds with diameters varying from 6 to 8 micrometers. Additionally, smaller pores and organic matter (OM) remains have been identified in areas containing less filaments and being dominated by carbonate. A Mg, Al and Si-rich phase has also been identified in the carbonate matrix associated with the dominant micritic calcite. Moreover, mineralized sheaths contain mixed carbonate (calcite) with Mg, Al and Si, where the latter elements are associated with authigenic clays. The presence of mineralized sheaths further attests to biologically induced processes during the uptake of CO(2)by photosynthetic microorganisms. Additionally, the high density of the micritic phase supports the subsequent mineralization by nonphotosynthetic microorganisms and/or physicochemical processes, such as evaporation. Since the micritic filament microstructure of these recent crusts is very similar to that observed in fossil microbialites, they can be used to bridge the gap between living mats and fossil buildups.","[Eymard, Ines; Ariztegui, Daniel] Univ Geneva, Dept Earth Sci, CH-1205 Geneva, Switzerland; [del Pilar Alvarez, Maria] Inst Patagon Estudio Ecosistemas Continentales IP, U9120ACD, Chubut, Argentina; [Bilmes, Andres] Inst Patagon Geol & Paleontol IPGP CONICET, U9120ACD, Chubut, Argentina; [Vasconcelos, Crisogono] Nucleo Inovacao & Tecnol Serv Geol Brasil, Ctr Desenvolvimento Tecnol CEDES, BR-22290180 Rio De Janeiro, Brazil","Eymard, I (corresponding author), Univ Geneva, Dept Earth Sci, CH-1205 Geneva, Switzerland.",ines.eymard@unige.ch; alvarez@cenpat-conicet.gob.ar; abilmes@cenpat-conicet.gob.ar; crisogono.vasconcelos@cprm.gov.br; Daniel.Ariztegui@unige.ch,,"Ariztegui, Daniel/0000-0001-7775-5127","Swiss National Science FoundationSwiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) [200021_155927, 200021_155927/2]","This research was funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation, grant numbers 200021_155927 and 200021_155927/2.",,61,0,0,0,0,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2075-163X,,MINERALS-BASEL,Minerals,JUL,2020,10,7,,,,,,,605,10.3390/min10070605,,,20,Mineralogy; Mining & Mineral Processing,Mineralogy; Mining & Mineral Processing,MS4JG,WOS:000554243900001,,DOAJ Gold,,,9/10/20

Based on unpublished stories essentially originating from New Caledonia, we show how strong the links are between myths and the physical environment in which Kanak live. As prevalent mythical animals, sharks can indifferently play the role of avengers and righters of wrongs, or vehicles for the spirits of living or dead people. They can be either allies or enemies in wars, and their role as potential man-killers is never overlooked. However, when humans are attacked and killed by a shark, it is always for a material reason: the victim broke a rule or a tabu, the shark was an enemy, the sharks withdrew protection, the event allowed a pregnant woman to reach a new territory, etc. Beyond arbitrary metaphysical justifications, such perceptions reflect respect for social and natural order. For Kanak ni-Vanuatu and other Pacific Islander peoples, sharks are part of a coherent Nature that includes natural and social hazards. In the quest for sustainable development of the planet, more in harmony with Nature, so-called 'developed societies' might draw inspiration from such perceptions. Indigenous understandings could also help change the globally negative perception of sharks, and support shark conservation efforts in Oceania and worldwide.","[Clua, Eric; Guiart, Jean] Ecole Prat Hautes Etud, Paris, France; [Clua, Eric] PSL Res Univ, Paris, France; [Clua, Eric] Lab Excellence CORAIL, Paris, France","Clua, E (corresponding author), Ecole Prat Hautes Etud, Paris, France.; Clua, E (corresponding author), PSL Res Univ, Paris, France.; Clua, E (corresponding author), Lab Excellence CORAIL, Paris, France.",,,,,,,50,0,0,6,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0029-8077,1834-4461,,OCEANIA,Oceania,JUL,2020,90,2,,,,,151,166,,10.1002/ocea.5249,,,16,Anthropology,Anthropology,MQ2KH,WOS:000552725500003,,,,,9/10/20

Due to the diversity of biomimetic surface functionalities, inspirations from natural surfaces are interesting for a broad range of applications in engineering, including phenomena of adhesion, friction, wear, lubrication, wetting phenomena, self-cleaning, antifouling, antibacterial phenomena, thermoregulation and optics. Lasers are increasingly proving to be promising tools for the precise and controlled structuring of materials at micro- and nano-scales. When ultrashort-pulsed lasers are used, the optimal interplay between laser and material parameters enables structuring down to the nanometer scale. Besides this, a unique aspect of laser processing technology is the possibility for material modifications at multiple (hierarchical) length scales, leading to the complex biomimetic micro- and nano-scale patterns, while adding a new dimension to structure optimization. This article reviews the current state of the art of laser processing methodologies, which are being used for the fabrication of bioinspired artificial surfaces to realize extraordinary wetting, optical, mechanical, and biological-active properties for numerous applications. The innovative aspect of laser functionalized biomimetic surfaces for a wide variety of current and future applications is particularly demonstrated and discussed. The article concludes with illustrating the wealth of arising possibilities and the number of new laser micro/nano fabrication approaches for obtaining complex high-resolution features, which prescribe a future where control of structures and subsequent functionalities are beyond our current imagination.","[Stratakis, E.; Tsibidis, G.

Providing a suitable assessment of marine litter effects on marine life through bioindicator species is crucial to drive an effective waste management policy. However, to date no standardized tool has been developed to describe and monitor the impact of marine macro-litter on marine life within deep-water habitats. Modifying the protocol proposed to monitor macro-litter ingestion by the loggerhead sea turtle Caretta caretta, we perform a preliminary investigation on the suitability of different elasmobranch species for monitoring macro-litter ingestion in deep-sea. A total of 122 specimens representing 7 elasmobranch species were collected and examined. External visual inspections documented no clear evidences of disease due to marine litter entanglement. A total of 7 ingested litter items were found in the stomach or in the esophagus of 6 specimens of 4 different species (frequency of occurrence = 4.9%), with a maximum number of 2 items per specimen. No litter items were found in the intestinal contents, as well as no evidence of gastrointestinal blockages due to litter items were detected. The low number of collected litter items suggests that the number of samples required is too large for a feasible monitoring program. Moreover, we observed that the anatomy of the intestinal spiral valve may represent an obstacle to the transit of macro-litter items, which could be spontaneously regurgitated as it happens in the selective elimination of undigested remains, such as bones and scales. Therefore, macro-litter retention time in the gastrointestinal tract of elasmobranchs could be brief and shorter than retention time of food. This may lead to an underestimation of macro-litter ingestion frequency by deep-water elasmobranchs. This study reports the first evidence of plastic ingestion by the kitefin shark Dalatias licha.","[Valente, Tommaso; Scacco, Umberto; Matiddi, Marco] Italian Natl Inst Environm Protect & Res, ISPRA, Via Castel Romano 100, I-00144 Rome, RM, Italy","Valente, T (corresponding author), Italian Natl Inst Environm Protect & Res, ISPRA, Via Castel Romano 100, I-00144 Rome, RM, Italy.",tommaso.valente@isprambiente.it; umberto.scacco@isprambiente.it; marco.matiddi@isprambiente.it,"Scacco, Umberto/AAX-1963-2020",,project MEDSEALITTER (European Union - European Regional Development Fund - Interreg MED) [1MED15_3.2_M12_334]; INDICIT consortium in the frame of the European DG-ENV [11.0661/2016/748064/SUB/ENV.C2]; European Commission - DG EnvironmentEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre [110661/2018/794286/SUB/ENV.C2],"This study was supported by the project MEDSEALITTER (1MED15_3.2_M12_334; European Union - European Regional Development Fund -Interreg MED) and by the INDICIT consortium in the frame of the European DG-ENV project GA No. 11.0661/2016/748064/SUB/ENV.C2.

Peru is experiencing a gastronomic revolution with seafood at its core, and Peruvian top chefs are being approached by conservation organizations to become environmental advocates. Within this context we characterize the factors that influence chefs' behaviours regarding sustainable seafood. A total of 52 Peruvian top chefs were surveyed using the Knowledge, Attitudes and Practices Framework, complemented by a focus group with a subset of the surveyed population. Our results suggest that, regardless of their age or academic background, chefs are aware of the negative consequences that human activities have on the ocean and believe that restaurants have an obligation to become part of the solution by promoting the use of sustainable seafood. Nonetheless, three factors limit chefs' understanding of key concepts and prevent them from fully internalizing the environmental consequences of their actions in restaurants: (1) sustainability is a new topic for them, particularly for older chefs; (2) the fish species commonly used at restaurants are poorly regulated, and (3) chefs are risk averse to actions that could result in profit loss.

Healthy Pangasianodon were inoculated intramuscularly with a sub-lethal dose of 1.77x10(7) cells/fish of E. tarda to induce edwardsiellosis. Petechial haemorrhages, inflammation at the site of injection, vertical hanging from the water surface, swollen abdomen and anorexia were the common signs observed in challenged catfish fingerlings. The morbid catfish also exhibited typical signs of septicaemia with haemorrhages on ventral parts of the body and fin bases and congested vent prior to death. The mortality was observed 48 h post injection. The average percent morality was 42 % in fish exposed to 1.77x10(7) cells of E. tarda, whereas, only6.6 % mortality was observed in placebo control (catfish received 0.1 mL of 0.85 % sterile physiological saline) and no mortality in negative control group (catfish received no injection) over an observational period of 20 days. The kidney and liver of moribund fish demonstrated different necrobiotic changes. In kidney, cellular and cloudy swelling, degeneration of renal tubules, necrosis of glomerulus, dilation of Bowman's space, hypertrophy, fibrosis of renal tubules and increased melano-macrophage reaction were frequently observed. In liver, disorganized hepatocytes, blood congestion and nuclear pyknosis were evident. To ascertain the host response to E. tarda infection, mRNA levels of three different classes of innate immune components viz. cytokine interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta), acute phase protein transferrrin and complement C3 were assessed by quantitative real-time PCR. Significant up-regulation (P < 0.05) of IL-1 beta and C3 gene expression was observed in infected fish upto 15 days post infection (dpi) in liver, kidney, spleen and blood though the level of increase differed among organs and dpi. Significant up-regulation (P < 0.05) of transferrin gene expression was seen at 1 dpi in kidney, spleen and blood while no significant variation could be observed in liver. The tissue specific pathology and changes in immune gene expression may help to improve the knowledge of E. tarda pathogenesis and role of the innate immune genes in this tropical catfish. The innate immune response of host to E. tarda which is evident from increased expression of innate immune genes may be further enhanced through immunostimulants and nutraceuticals to prevent disease onset and use of antibiotics.","[Hoque, Farhana] ICAR Cent Inst Freshwater Aquaculture, Reg Res Ctr Rahara, PO Rahara, Kolkata 700118, W Bengal, India; [Pawar, Nilambari; Pitale, Pranali; Gireesh-Babu, P.; Chaudhari, Aparna] ICAR Cent Inst Fisheries Educ, Mumbai 400061, Maharashtra, India; [Dutta, Rajdeep] Assam Agr Univ, Coll Fisheries, Raha 782103, Assam, India; [Sawant, Bhawesh] Konkan Krishi Vidyapeeth, Taraporewala Marine Biol Res Stn, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India; [Sundaray, Jitendra Kumar] ICAR Cent Inst Freshwater Aquaculture, Bhubaneswar 751002, Odisha, India","Sundaray, JK (corresponding author), ICAR Cent Inst Freshwater Aquaculture, Bhubaneswar 751002, Odisha, India.",jsundaray@gmail.com,,,"Department of Biotechnology, Ministry of Science and Technology","This work was supported by the Department of Biotechnology, Ministry of Science and Technology, Govt. of India under three months National Training scheme on `Molecular Biology and Biotechnology for Fishery Professionals'.",,54,0,0,0,0,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2352-5134,,,AQUACULT REP,Aquacult.

An unusual property of progesterone is its high affinity for the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR), which regulates electrolyte transport in the kidney in humans and other terrestrial vertebrates. In humans, rats, alligators and frogs, progesterone antagonizes activation of the MR by aldosterone, the physiological mineralocorticoid in terrestrial vertebrates. In contrast, in elephant shark, ray-finned fishes and chickens, progesterone activates the MR. Interestingly, cartilaginous fishes and ray-finned fishes do not synthesize aldosterone, raising the question of which steroid(s) activate the MR in cartilaginous fishes and ray-finned fishes. The simpler synthesis of progesterone, compared to cortisol and other corticosteroids, makes progesterone a candidate physiological activator of the MR in elephant sharks and ray-finned fishes. Elephant shark and ray-finned fish MRs are expressed in diverse tissues, including heart, brain and lung, as well as, ovary and testis, two reproductive tissues that are targets for progesterone, which together suggests a multi-faceted physiological role for progesterone activation of the MR in elephant shark and ray-finned fish. The functional consequences of progesterone as an antagonist of some terrestrial vertebrate MRs and as an agonist of fish and chicken MRs are not fully understood. The physiological activities of progesterone through binding to vertebrate MRs merits further investigation.","[Baker, Michael E.] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Med, Div Nephrol Hypertens, 0735,9500 Gilman Dr, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Katsu, Yoshinao] Hokkaido Univ, Grad Sch Life Sci, Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan","Baker, ME (corresponding author), Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Med, Div Nephrol Hypertens, 0735,9500 Gilman Dr, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.",mbaker@ucsd.edu; ykatsu@sci.hokudai.ac.jp,,"Baker, Michael/0000-0003-4387-3269","Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of JapanMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT) [19K0673409];  [3096]","This work was supported in part by Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research 19K0673409 (YK) from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan.

Customarily, this feature has been treated somewhat superficially in phylogenetic analyses, often as a single defining character of a chondrichthyan clade. TCC is actually a complex hard tissue with numerous distinctive attributes, but its use as a character complex for phylogenetic analysis has not yet been optimized. This study attempts to improve this situation by presenting new terminology for certain aspects of tesseral architecture, including single-monolayered, multiple-monolayered, polylayered and voussoir tesserae; new histological data, including thin sections of TCC in several Palaeozoic taxa, and new proposals for ways in which various characters and states (many of which are defined here for the first time) could be applied in future phylogenetic analyses of chondrichthyan fishes. It can be concluded that many, but not all, of the unique attributes of modern TCC evolved by the Early Devonian (ca. 400 before present (bp)). The globular calcified cartilage reported in Silurian sinacanthids and the so-called subtessellated perichondral biomineralization (with irregular and ill-defined geometries of a layer or layers of calcified cartilage blocks) of certain extinct acanthodians (e.g.,Climatius,Ischnacanthus,Cheiracanthus) could represent evolutionary precursors of TCC, which seems to characterize only part of the chondrichthyan total group. It is hypothesized that heavily biomineralized layer-cake TCC in certain Palaeozoic chondrichthyans perhaps served a dual physiological role, as a phosphate sink and in providing increased skeletal density in very large (>7 m) Devonian-Permian marine sharks such as ctenacanths and as an adaptation to calcium-deficient environments among Permo-Carboniferous non-marine sharks such as xenacanths. By contrast, the equivalent tissue in modern elasmobranchs probably serves only to reinforce regions of cartilage (mostly in the jaws) subjected to high loading. It is also noted that much of the variation observed in tesseral architecture (including localized remodelling), ultrastructure and histology in modern and extinct chondrichthyans is confined to the perichondrally facing cap zone (where Type-1 collagen matrix predominates in modern TCC), whereas the main body of the tessera (where Type-2 collagen matrix predominates) exhibits comparatively little evidence of remodelling and histological or structural variation.","[Maisey, John G.] Amer Museum Nat Hist, Dept Vertebrate Paleontol, New York, NY 10024 USA; [Denton, John S.

There are only three species of thresher sharks worldwide. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed pelagic (A. pelagicus) thresher sharks as endangered while bigeye (Alopias superciliosus) and common (A. vulpinus) thresher sharks as vulnerable to extinction. There is limited scientific information about thresher shark fisheries in the Philipines. In this study we described a thresher shark fishery in Tawi-Tawi, Southern Philippines which has been existing for more than 20 years now. The fishery is generally small-scale, using simple hook and line and 13-hp inboard motorized boats with a capacity of one to two fishers per boat. Fishing is year-round with peak season occurring from March to May. Fishers spend about 10 days per month fishing during neap tide when the currents are weak. All three species of thresher sharks are caught in Tawi-Tawi. They are generally hunted for their fins and meat which are sold to local buyers. About 50 boats fish per day with about half of them catching one to two sharks. Our study suggests that monthly production of thresher sharks during the peak season in 2018 was about 15.3 mt or valued at about US$19,886.39. Our study is the first to report that the Sibutu Passage is an important fishing grounds for thresher sharks which must be put under immediate protection for effective conservation of these valuable species.","[Muallil, Richard N.; Hapid, Mohammad Gafor N.] Mindanao State Univ, Tawi Tawi Coll Technol & Oceanog, Bongao 7500, Tawi Tawi, Philippines","Muallil, RN (corresponding author), Mindanao State Univ, Tawi Tawi Coll Technol & Oceanog, Bongao 7500, Tawi Tawi, Philippines.",rnmuallil@msutawi-tawi.edu.ph,,,Office of the Continuing Education and Extension Services (OCEANeS) of the Mindanao State University Tawi-Tawi College of Technology,The study was part of the internally funded research and extension activities of the Office of the Continuing Education and Extension Services (OCEANeS) of the Mindanao State University Tawi-Tawi College of Technology.

Managers need to identify where and when bycatch occurs and ensure effective action. In 1999, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations released the International Plan of Action for Reducing Incidental Catch of Seabirds in Longline Fisheries (IPOA-s) encouraging states to voluntarily assess potential seabird bycatch problems and implement a National Plan of Action (NPOA) if needed. However, the IPOA-s is ambiguous about the steps and objectives, diminishing its value as a conservation tool. We reviewed NPOAs to identify approaches taken to determine whether seabird bycatch is problematic, how bycatch minimisation and population objectives are set, and if thresholds are specified for managing impacts. Our aim was to recommend measures for improving consistency and effectiveness in future NPOAs and other management frameworks for seabirds, with relevance for other threatened marine vertebrates including sharks, turtles, pinnipeds and cetaceans. Globally, 16 NPOAs have been published, but few effectively linked seabird bycatch risk, objectives and management. However, we identified the following best-practice elements that could improve NPOA design: (1) defining explicit risk criteria and methods to assess bycatch problems; (2) setting specific and measurable objectives for minimising bycatch and achieving desired population status; and (3) defining fishery-specific thresholds to trigger management action linked to the population objective. Consistent adoption of NPOA best practice, particularly in states that have not already developed an NPOA, would help to mitigate bycatch threats and ensure fisheries do not reduce the viability of seabird populations.","[Good, S.

Further, the strength of association among allied male dolphins varies and the stability of alliances correlates with the rate that males consort with estrus females (and is thus a possible indicator of dominance). To examine the possibility that synchrony reflects alliance association strength and dominance relationships, we analyzed videotapes from focal follows of two groups of males that reflect the range of alliance size and the strength of association between individuals in the population. We examined two variables:leadershipduring synchronous behaviors, based on which animal in a synchronously surfacing pair surfaced first, and thedegree of synchrony, based on temporal differences in synchronous surfacing. We predicted that closer associates would exhibit a greater degree of synchrony and that one dolphin in a dyad would consistently lead. Contrary to our predictions, the degree of synchrony was inversely related to strength of association within alliances. This surprising result suggests that individuals with less secure bonds may strive more to achieve synchrony. We found no evidence of leadership during synchronous surfacing or between synchrony and other behavioral variables. Proximate mechanisms for synchronous behavior, such as entrainment and mutual motor imitation (the mirror game paradigm), may inhibit leadership in this context. Our results show that synchrony during surfacing is not a useful behavior to examine for dominance relationships in wild dolphins but it may be a useful tool to examine variation in alliance relationships.","[McCue, Laura M.; Connor, Richard C.] Univ Massachusetts Dartmouth, N Dartmouth, MA USA; [Cioffi, William R.] Duke Univ, Marine Lab, Univ Program Ecol, Beaufort, NC 28516 USA; [Heithaus, Michael R.] Florida Int Univ, Sch Environm Arts & Soc, North Miami, FL USA; [Barre, Lynne] NOAA, Fisheries Serv, Protected Resources Div, Seattle, WA USA","Connor, RC (corresponding author), UMass Dartmouth, Biol Dept, 285 Old Westport Rd, Dartmouth, MA 02747 USA.",rconnor@umassd.edu,,"Heithaus, Michael/0000-0002-3219-1003; Cioffi, William/0000-0003-1182-8578",,,,92,2,2,5,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0179-1613,1439-0310,,ETHOLOGY,Ethology,JUL,2020,126,7,,,,,741,750,,10.1111/eth.13025,,,10,"Psychology, Biological; Behavioral Sciences; Zoology",Psychology; Behavioral Sciences; Zoology,LY0EH,WOS:000540196900008,,,,,9/10/20

The scarcity of data also makes it difficult to interpret results obtained in developmental studies done in model organisms, such as zebrafish. To overcome these gaps, we provide descriptions of the configuration of all appendicular muscles of Amia, median fins of Polypterus, and the dorsal and anal fins of Lepisosteus and Chondrostei. The musculature of other species, including sharks and sturgeons, is also revised. We describe muscles that were previously overlooked, report sexual dimorphism in the muscles of the anal fin of Polypterus, and reveal muscle variations within Polypterus males. Species dissected for the present study thus represent all major non-sarcopterygian extant clades of gnathostomes, i.e. Chondrichthyes, Polypteriformes, Chondrostei, Lepisosteiformes, Amiiformes and Teleostei. Moreover, we compare our observations with the relatively few works that have provided information about muscles of at least some fins of these taxa in order to provide a broad discussion on - and detailed schemes showing - the major evolutionary patterns within the appendicular musculature of these fishes. Such discussion provides an opportunity for a more comprehensive understanding of appendicular evolution and fish evolution in particular and of gnathostome and morphological evolution in general.

In this article, two case studies with different climates were considered in the prediction of monthly evaporation. The optimization algorithms, namely shark algorithm (SA) and firefly algorithms (FFAs), were used to train the adaptive neuro-fuzzy interface system (ANFIS), multilayer perceptron (MLP) model and radial basis function (RBF) model for the prediction of monthly evaporation. The monthly weather data from two stations, Mianeh station and Yazd station, operated by the Iran Meteorological Service were used to examine the proposed models. In the quantitative analysis, the hybrid ANFIS-SA improved the MAE index over the ANFIS, RBF, MLP, RBF-SA, MLP-SA, RBF-FFA, MLP-FFA and ANFIS-SA up to 47% during training and to 51% during testing while examining Yazd station. It should be mentioned that the higher RSR and MAE were attained by the hybrid soft computing (ANN-FFA, RBF-FFA and ANFIS-FFA) models in two stations. The results proved that the developed ANFIS models that have been integrated with shark algorithms could be considered as a powerful tool for predicting evaporation.","[Mohamadi, S.] Grad Univ Adv Technol, Inst Sci & High Technol & Environm Sci, Dept Ecol, Kerman, Iran; [Ehteram, M.] Semnan Univ, Fac Civil Engn, Dept Water Engn & Hydraul Struct, Semnan, Iran; [El-Shafie, A.] Univ Malaya, Fac Engn, Civil Engn Dept, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia","Mohamadi, S (corresponding author), Grad Univ Adv Technol, Inst Sci & High Technol & Environm Sci, Dept Ecol, Kerman, Iran.",mohamadisedigeh@gmail.com,,,,,,39,2,2,2,2,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1735-1472,1735-2630,,INT J ENVIRON SCI TE,Int.

In this manuscript, we characterize the IgNAR of the whitespotted bamboo shark. A newly discovered alternative splicing form of IgNAR Sec (IgNAR(sh)(ort) (Delta C2-C3) Sec) was identified, in which the C1 domain was spliced directly to the C4 domain, the process resulted in a molecule containing three constant domains. However, a single unpaired cysteine remains in the highly flexible hinge region, contributing in the formation of an interchain disulfide bond. Two types of C1 domain were found, and the one lacking a short a-helix showed lower proportion. This finding suggests that short alpha-helices might be important to the stability of IgNAR. High-throughput sequencing revealed that the percentage of V-NAR types significantly vary between the diverse species of sharks. The variable region of IgNAR (the V-NAR) with small size and stabilization is a potential candidate for immunotherapeutic agents. The structure and stability analysis in this manuscript may be useful in future biomedical applications.","[Zhang, Wenjie; Qin, Lanyi; Cai, Xinyi; Juma, Salma Nassor; Xu, Rong; Wei, Ling; Wu, Yixin; Cui, Xuan; Chen, Guiqian; Liu, Lili; Lv, Zhengbing; Jiang, Xiaofeng] Zhejiang Sci Tech Univ, Coll Life Sci, Hangzhou 310018, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Wenjie; Qin, Lanyi; Cai, Xinyi; Juma, Salma Nassor; Xu, Rong; Wei, Ling; Wu, Yixin; Cui, Xuan; Chen, Guiqian; Liu, Lili; Lv, Zhengbing; Jiang, Xiaofeng] Zhejiang Sci Tech Univ, Zhejiang Prov Key Lab Silkworm Bioreactor & Biome, Hangzhou 310018, Peoples R China","Lv, ZB; Jiang, XF (corresponding author), Zhejiang Sci Tech Univ, Coll Life Sci, Hangzhou 310018, Peoples R China.",zwj_67890@163.com; lanyiqin_catherine@163.com; 846710050@qq.com; salmanassor60@yahoo.com; xurong20172020@163.com; Weilingxixi@163.com; woshiwuyixin@126.com; cuixuanzstu1103@163.com; gqchen@zstu.edu.cn; llliu@zstu.edu.cn; zhengbingl@zstu.edu.cn; xfjiang@zstu.edu.cn,,"Jiang, Xiaofeng/0000-0002-6691-9816","Zhejiang Provincial Public Welfare Technology Application Research Project, China [LGF19H250002]","This research was funded by Zhejiang Provincial Public Welfare Technology Application Research Project, China, grant number: LGF19H250002.",,27,0,0,5,5,ACADEMIC PRESS LTD- ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,LONDON,"24-28 OVAL RD, LONDON NW1 7DX, ENGLAND",1050-4648,1095-9947,,FISH SHELLFISH IMMUN,Fish Shellfish Immunol.,JUL,2020,102,,,,,,140,144,,10.1016/j.fsi.2020.04.037,,,5,Fisheries; Immunology; Marine & Freshwater Biology; Veterinary Sciences,Fisheries; Immunology; Marine & Freshwater Biology; Veterinary Sciences,LU5VL,WOS:000537822700017,32311460,,,,9/10/20

While most studies focus on relatively gradual changes, extreme events may have lasting impacts on populations. Animals respond to major disturbances such as hurricanes by seeking shelter, migrating, or they may fail to respond appropriately. We assessed the effects of Hurricane Irma in 2017 on the behavior and survival of juvenile bull sharks (Carcharhinus leucas) within a nursery of the Florida coastal Everglades using long-term acoustic telemetry monitoring. Most of our tagged sharks (n = 14) attempted to leave the shallow waters of the Shark River Estuary before the hurricane strike, but individuals varied in the timing and success of their movements. Eight bull sharks left within hours or days before the hurricane, but three left more than a week in advance. Nine of 11 bull sharks (~ 82%) eventually returned to the array within weeks or months of the storm. Six of these returning individuals were detected in a different coastal array in nearshore waters ca. 80 km away from the mouth of the estuary during their absence. The remaining three bull sharks moved downstream relatively late (after the hurricane) and may have died. We used binomial generalized linear mixed models to estimate the probability of presence within the array as a function of several environmental variables. Departure from the array was predicted by declining barometric pressure, increasing rate of change in pressure, and potentially fluctuations in river stage. Juvenile bull sharks may weigh multiple environmental cues, perceived predation risk, their own physical size, and shifting prey resources when making decisions during and after hurricanes.","[Strickland, Bradley A.; Gastrich, Kirk R.; Paz, Valeria; Heithaus, Michael R.] Florida Int Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Miami, FL 33199 USA; [Massie, Jordan A.; Viadero, Natasha; Santos, Rolando; Rehage, Jennifer S.] Florida Int Univ, Dept Earth & Environm, Miami, FL 33199 USA; [O'Donnell, Patrick] Rookery Bay Natl Estuarine Res Reserve, Florida Dept Environm Protect, Naples, FL 34113 USA; [Kroetz, Andrea M.] Riverside Technol Inc, Natl Ocean & Atmospher Assoc, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Southeast Fisheries Sci Ctr, Panama City, FL 32408 USA; [Ho, David T.] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Oceanog, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA","Strickland, BA (corresponding author), Florida Int Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Miami, FL 33199 USA.",bstri007@fiu.edu,,"Strickland, Bradley/0000-0001-6443-7672; Massie, Jordan/0000-0002-8255-7448; Heithaus, Michael/0000-0002-3219-1003; Kroetz, Andrea/0000-0002-9670-7478",,,,46,4,4,11,11,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1559-2723,1559-2731,,ESTUAR COAST,Estuaries Coasts,JUL,2020,43,5,,,SI,,1144,1157,,10.1007/s12237-019-00600-7,,,14,Environmental Sciences; Marine & Freshwater Biology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Marine & Freshwater Biology,LU1GY,WOS:000537511500017,,,,,9/10/20

Specifically, we gathered information on fishers' perceptions of megafauna in the Bay of Bengal to determine whether fishers view megafauna species as beneficial or harmful and/or under threat. Fieldwork was conducted at five sites from the three coastal districts of Bangladesh. Data were collected through individual interviews (n = 150), focus group discussions (n = 13) and key informant interviews (n = 20). Small-scale fishers interact with marine megafauna as bycatch or intentional harvest, although a small portion of fishers keep the bycatch for sale and consumption or use as ingredients in traditional medicine. Most fishers release marine megafauna back into the water because they are not interested in the catch, they want to obey rules protecting these species or because of social taboos. Fishers have different views on the positive and negative roles of marine megafauna. The perceived positive roles are as indicators of productive fishing grounds, sources of food and livelihoods, and maintenance of ecosystem balance. The perceived negative roles are damage to fishing gear, personal injury, bad omens and predation on target fish. Irrespective of their perceived roles, megafauna groups are vulnerable to the use of fishing gear, pollution, overfishing, bycatch, direct killing, environmental changes and lack of awareness. The present study also summarises the relevant national and international legal obligations relating to the protection of megafauna. The findings reflect a lack of a coherent legal and institutional framework to facilitate conservation of marine megafauna. The results of this study contribute to a better understanding of megafauna status in the northern Bay of Bengal that, in effect, will help define future efforts to enhance marine megafauna conservation in the context of achieving the UN Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 14 and blue growth.","[Begum, Amany; Uzzaman, Md.

When the receptor was expressed alone, stimulation was only observed at [10(-6) M]. A comparable increase in sensitivity to stimulation by srDes-Ac-alpha MSH was also observed when the receptor was co-expressed with wsMRAP1. In addition, co-expression with wsMRAP1 significantly increased the trafficking of wsMC2R to the plasma membrane of CHO cells. Surprisingly, co-expression with wsMRAP2 also increased sensitivity to stimulation by ACTH(1-24) and srDes-Ac-alpha MSH, and increased trafficking of the receptor to the plasma membrane. These observations are in sharp contrast to the response of MC2R orthologs of bony vertebrates which have an obligate requirement for co-expression with MRAP1 for both trafficking to the plasma membrane and activation, and while co-expression with MRAP2 increases trafficking, it has minimal effects on activation. In addition, when comparing the activation features of wsMC2R with those of the elephant shark MC2R and red stingray MC2R orthologs, both similarities and differences are observed. The spectrum of features for cartilaginous fish MC2R orthologs will be discussed. A second objective of this study was to determine whether wsMC5R has features in common with wsMC2R in terms of ligand selectivity and interaction with wsMRAP paralogs. While wsMC5R can be activated by either srACTH(1-24) or srDes-Ac-alpha MSH, and co-expression with wsMRAP1 enhances this activation, wsMRAP1 had no effect on the trafficking of wsMC5R. Co-expression with wsMRAP2 had no positive or negative effect on either ligand sensitivity or trafficking of wsMC5R.","[Hoglin, Brianne E.; Miner, Marin; Dores, Robert M.] Univ Denver, Dept Biol Sci, Denver, CO 80210 USA","Dores, RM (corresponding author), Univ Denver, Dept Biol Sci, Denver, CO 80210 USA.",rdores@du.edu,,,Long Research Endowment,This research was supported by the Long Research Endowment (RMD).,,25,0,0,1,1,ACADEMIC PRESS INC ELSEVIER SCIENCE,SAN DIEGO,"525 B ST, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA",0016-6480,1095-6840,,GEN COMP ENDOCR,Gen.

The assemblage was studied by Sorbini in 1976 based on material from a single locality, Cinto Euganeo. Subsequently, other localities yielding fish remains have been discovered. Our revision also includes fish remains from three new fish-bearing localities, the Carcoselle Quarry, the Valdagno-Schio tunnel and Quem other than those from Bomba Quarry near Cinto Euganeo. At least 27 taxa were identified, including nine previously not reported from the Bonarelli Level, namely: Scpanorhynchus raphiodon, Cretalamna appendiculata, Archaeolamna kopingensis, 'Nursallid tethysensis, Belonostomus sp., Dixonanogmius dalmatius,'Protoenti stebbingi and the beryciform Hoplopteryx sp.

A comparison of the taxonomic diversity with coeval assemblages evidences a general similarity with nearby western Tethyan fish assemblages and especially with the Jbel Tselfat ichthyofauna, although some of the taxa are exclusively shared with the assemblages of the boreal realm (English Chalk, Westphalia and Saxony).

Therefore, this study aimed to assess total Hg (THg) concentrations in S. albicaudus, a deep-water species, sampled off Southeastern Brazil and discuss ecological, reproductive, human consumption and conservation implications. Thirty-two individuals were sampled off the coast of Rio de Janeiro, including 13 gravid females carrying 34 embryos. Muscle THg concentrations were higher in all sex classes compared to liver, gonads and brain. The last three, in turn, presented THg concentrations above toxic biota thresholds. Significant correlations were observed between muscle and brain and liver, indicating systemic Hg contamination and inter-organ transport and distribution. In addition, correlations observed between organs strongly support efficient Hg blood-brain barrier crossing and maternal transfer. Maternal THg transfer was observed, with embryo THg also above toxic thresholds for fish. THg levels in muscle and liver, as well as embryos, were higher compared to other Squalus species worldwide. Hg contamination off the coast of Rio de Janeiro is of significant concern and should be further assessed. Potential human consumption risks are noted, as muscle THg concentrations were above maximum permissible levels set by regulatory agencies. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Here we describe an extraordinarily diverse assemblage of dermal denticles from deposits of Austria, comprising 17 different morphotypes. Based on the functional types of the denticles and their morphological similarities with both extinct and extant representatives, we attempt an order-level taxonomic attribution of the morphotypes recovered. The herein recorded occurrences of Hexanchiformes, Squaliformes, Squatiniformes, Heterodontiformes, the family Protospinacidae (Squalomorphii incertae sedis), and probably Rajiformes or Chimaeriformes increase previous tooth-based taxic diversity estimates of Valanginian cartilaginous fishes from Austria from four to at least nine orders. Additionally, we discuss the absence of denticles of cladodontomorph chondrichthyans, whose teeth were previously reported from the same deposits. Etched sections and light microscope analysis were carried out using the most abundant morphotypes with the aim of exploring the histology of chondrichthyan dermal denticles. Our results confirm previous studies in reporting a single crystallite enameloid, but we also report for the first time the presence of bundled enameloid in dermal scales, a condition so far restricted to the tooth enameloid of some chondrichthyans. Additionally, a putative new dentine type is observed, leading to the introduction of the descriptive term 'nepedentine' for the internal, dense, and poorly supplied dentine core by vascular channels.

However, most studies have focused exclusively on the morphological aspects of teeth, while there are significantly fewer detailed accounts of tooth microstructure and mineralogy. Here we provide a full description of the enamel and dentine microstructure of mosasaurid squamates based on an assessment of isolated teeth belonging to two distantly related mosasaurid taxa, i.e., a russellosaurinan and a mosasaurine, from the ?Coniaciane-Santonian and Maastrichtian of Belgium. The obtained data are further explored with regard to their value for inferences of mosasaurid predatory behaviour. SEM observations have shown that the Schmelzmuster consists of columnar enamel with an outer layer of parallel crystallites; transmitted light observations have further revealed the presence of mantle dentine cushioning between enamel and orthodentine, and electron microprobe analyses have demonstrated the unaltered enamel chemistry and heterogeneous diagenetic alteration of dentine. Columnar enamel allows minute movements without rupture under bending stress, and together with the presence of shock-absorbing mantle dentine and possibly elevated Fe contents in the enamel, which increase its hardness and enhance acid resistance, it is suggestive of a good ability of the teeth to withstand severe mechanical damage. Such properties of teeth indicate adaptation to shaking and tearing large and resisting prey. (C) 2020 The Authors.

We have previously shown an antigen-specific recall response in nurse sharks almost one year after primary exposure. Herein, we extend the time between prime and successful recall to > 8 years, the longest period for which immunological memory has been shown in any non-mammalian vertebrate. We confirm that antigen binding is mediated by monomeric IgM and IgNAR, but not pentameric IgM, in both the primary and recall phases. Our inability to find target-binding clones in recombinant VNAR expression libraries suggests that, at least in this instance, antigen-specific memory cells comprise a small fraction of the IgNAR-positive B cells in epigonal and spleen. Further, that the few memory cells present can generate a robust antigen-specific IgNAR titer following re-stimulation.

To determine spatio-temporal habitat use by juvenile male whale sharks in Cenderawasih Bay, Indonesia, we collected data from June 2015 to November 2016 using 16 fin-mounted satellite tags that provided exceptionally long track durations. Fifteen tags transmitted for 48-534 days (mean = 321 +/- 33, s.e.), with 13 tags transmitting for >= 220 days. Four sharks remained within the bay for the duration of the study, while of the 11 sharks that travelled outside the bay, eight left between March and May 2016. They ranged throughout coastal and offshore waters, travelling up to 5144 km away from Cenderawasih Bay, with a mean horizontal speed of only 3.3 km day(-1) +/- 0.70, s.e. A switching state space model was fitted to satellite fix data to identify behavioural states. It revealed that sharks spent an average of 81% of their time in foraging-related behaviours, mostly in shallow waters (median depth = 35 m), with travelling observed mainly over deeper waters (median depth = 1284 m). The movement patterns reveal variable periods of residency, with individual patterns of horizontal movement most likely in response to different abiotic and biotic factors, including food availability, which may trigger seasonal dispersal.","[Meyers, Megan M.; Constantine, Rochelle] Univ Auckland, Inst Marine Sci, Private Bag 92019, Auckland, New Zealand; [Francis, Malcolm P.] Natl Inst Water & Atmospher Res, Wellington, New Zealand; [Erdmann, Mark; Sianipar, Abraham] Conservat Int Indonesia Marine Program, Bali, Indonesia; [Erdmann, Mark] Calif Acad Sci, 55 Mus Concourse Dr, San Francisco, CA 94118 USA; [Constantine, Rochelle] Univ Auckland, Sch Biol Sci, Private Bag 92019, Auckland, New Zealand","Meyers, MM (corresponding author), Univ Auckland, Inst Marine Sci, Private Bag 92019, Auckland, New Zealand.",megan.meyers@research.uwa.edu.au,,,True North expedition vessel; Ministry of Environment and ForestryMinistry of Forestry & Water Affairs - Turkey; Ministry of Marine Affairs and Fisheries,"We thank B.

However, the difficulties associated with conducting broad-scale surveys of oceanic environments restrict the evidence base available for applied management in pelagic waters. For example, the Oceanic Shoals Australian Marine Park (AMP) was established in 2012 in a part of Australia's continental shelf where unique topographic features are thought to support significant levels of biodiversity, yet where our understanding of ecological processes remains limited. We deployed mid-water baited remote underwater video systems (mid-water BRUVS) in the Oceanic Shoals AMP to provide the first non-extractive baseline assessment of pelagic wildlife communities in the area. We used these observations and high-resolution multibeam swaths of the seafloor to explore potential relationships between prominent geomorphological features and the (i) composition, (ii) richness, and (iii) relative abundance of pelagic communities. We documented 32 vertebrate species across three sampling areas, ranging from small baitfish to large sharks and rays, and estimated that up to nearly twice as many taxa may occur within the region as a whole. This highlights the Oceanic Shoals AMP as a reservoir of biodiversity comparable to other documented offshore oceanic hotspots. Our results also confirm the AMP as a possible distant foraging destination for IUCN red listed sea turtles, and a potential breeding and/or nursing ground for a number of charismatic cetaceans. Model outputs indicate that both species richness and abundance increase in proximity to raised geomorphic structures such as submerged banks and pinnacles, highlighting the influence of submarine topography on megafauna distribution. By providing a foundational understanding of spatial patterns in pelagic wildlife communities throughout a little studied region, our work demonstrates how a combination of non-destructive sampling techniques and predictive models can provide new opportunities to support decision-making under data shortage.","[Bouchett, Phil J.; Letessiert, Tom B.; Hemmi, Jan M.; Meeuwig, Jessica J.] Univ Western Australia, Sch Biol Sci, Crawley, WA, Australia; [Bouchett, Phil J.] Univ St Andrews, Sch Math & Stat, St Andrews, Fife, Scotland; [Bouchett, Phil J.] Univ St Andrews, Ctr Res Ecol & Environm Modelling, St Andrews, Fife, Scotland; [Letessiert, Tom B.] Zool Soc London, Inst Zool, London, England; [Caley, Michael Julian] Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Math Sci, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Caley, Michael Julian] Univ Melbourne, Australian Res Council Ctr Excellence Math & Stat, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Nichol, Scott L.] Geosci Australia, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Meeuwig, Jessica J.] Univ Australia, UWA Oceans Inst, Crawley, WA, Australia","Bouchett, PJ (corresponding author), Univ Western Australia, Sch Biol Sci, Crawley, WA, Australia.; Bouchett, PJ (corresponding author), Univ St Andrews, Sch Math & Stat, St Andrews, Fife, Scotland.; Bouchett, PJ (corresponding author), Univ St Andrews, Ctr Res Ecol & Environm Modelling, St Andrews, Fife, Scotland.",pjbouchet@gmail.com,,,Australian Government's National Environmental Research Program (NERP)Australian Government,"This research was undertaken for the Marine Biodiversity Hub, a collaborative partnership supported through funding from the Australian Government's National Environmental Research Program (NERP).

In this study, we used historical memories of Sicilian fishers to understand their perception of change in abundance of cartilaginous fish in the Strait of Sicily over the last decades. We conducted interviews with 27 retired fishers from Mazara del Vallo harbor (SW Sicily) working in demersal fisheries, using a pre-defined questionnaire with a series of open and fixed questions related to the abundance of sharks and rays. The questionnaire included specific questions about the trends they perceived in catch or by-catch of cartilaginous fish abundance between the 1940s and 2000s compared to the present. Information was gathered for 18 species, including Carcharhinidae, mesopredatory demersal sharks (Squalidae, Hexanchidae, Centrophoridae, Oxynotidae, Triakidae, Scyliorhinidae, and Squatinidae) and batoids. Overall shark catches were perceived to have diminished since the early 1940s: about 95% of fishers reported the decline of commercially important species (e.g., Mustelus spp.) and indicated species that could have been depleted or locally extinct (e.g., Squatina spp., Sphyma lewini, Mustelus asterias, etc.). Our study shows that LEK of fishers can be beneficial for reconstructing long-term population trends of exploited species when traditional standard data on fisheries catch or species relative abundance from surveys is limited or only available for recent periods. The results obtained clearly indicate the rapid and alarming decline of elasmobranchs in the Strait of Sicily highlighting the need for urgent conservation measures to be adopted.","[Colloca, Francesco] Stn Zool Anton Dohrn, Dept Integrat Marine Ecol, Naples, Italy; [Colloca, Francesco] Sapienza Univ Rome, Dept Biol & Biotechnol Charles Darwin, Rome, Italy; [Carrozzi, Virginia; Di Lorenzo, Manfredi] Natl Res Council IRBIM CNR, Inst Marine Biol Resources & Biotechnol, Mazara Del Vallo, Italy; [Simonetti, Andrea] Univ Palermo, Dept Econ Business & Stat, Palermo, Italy","Colloca, F (corresponding author), Stn Zool Anton Dohrn, Dept Integrat Marine Ecol, Naples, Italy.; Colloca, F (corresponding author), Sapienza Univ Rome, Dept Biol & Biotechnol Charles Darwin, Rome, Italy.",francesco.colloca@szn.it,,,"National Research Council, Institute for Marine Biological Resources, and Biotechnologies of Mazara del Vallo; Italian National flagship programme RITMARE","This publication has emanated from research supported by the National Research Council, Institute for Marine Biological Resources, and Biotechnologies of Mazara del Vallo and funded by the Italian National flagship programme RITMARE.",,34,1,1,2,2,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,2296-7745,,FRONT MAR SCI,Front.

Furthermore, our study reveals the diversity and location of non-canonical cysteines and their associated motifs in human V(H)s, which are reminiscent of and more complex than those found in other non-human species such as chicken, camel, llama, shark, and cow. These results explain how non-canonical cysteines strategically occur in the human antibodyome to expand its paratope space.

However, little is known about how certain strategies influence foraging success and efficiency. Due to the miniaturisation of animal tracking technologies, a single individual can be equipped with multiple data loggers to obtain multi-scale tracking information. With the addition of animal-borne video data loggers, it is possible to provide context-specific information for movement data obtained over the video recording periods. Through a combination of video data loggers, accelerometers, GPS and depth recorders, this study investigated the influence of habitat, sex and the presence of other predators on the foraging success and efficiency of the endangered African penguin, Spheniscus demersus, from two colonies in Algoa Bay, South Africa. Due to limitations in the battery life of video data loggers, a machine learning model was developed to detect prey captures across full foraging trips. The model was validated using prey capture signals detected in concurrently recording accelerometers and animal-borne cameras and was then applied to detect prey captures throughout the full foraging trip of each individual. Using GPS and bathymetry information to inform the position of dives, individuals were observed to perform both pelagic and benthic diving behaviour. Females were generally more successful on pelagic dives than males, suggesting a trade-off between manoeuvrability and physiological diving capacity. By contrast, males were more successful in benthic dives, at least for Bird Island (BI) birds, possibly due to their larger size compared to females, allowing them to exploit habitat deeper and for longer durations. Both males at BI and both sexes at St Croix (SC) exhibited similar benthic success rates. This may be due to the comparatively shallower seafloor around SC, which could increase the likelihood of females capturing prey on benthic dives. Observation of camera data indicated individuals regularly foraged with a range of other predators including penguins and other seabirds, predatory fish (sharks and tuna) and whales. The presence of other seabirds increased individual foraging success, while predatory fish reduced it, indicating competitive exclusion by larger heterospecifics. This study highlights novel benthic foraging strategies in African penguins and suggests that individuals could buffer the effects of changes to prey availability in response to climate change. Furthermore, although group foraging was prevalent in the present study, its influence on foraging success depends largely on the type of heterospecifics present.","[Sutton, Grace; Arnould, John P.

The eye denticle differs in morphology from that of the dermal denticles distributed over the rest of the body, consistent with a different function (abrasion resistance). We also demonstrate that the whale shark has a strong ability to retract the eyeball into the eye socket. The retraction distance was calculated to be approximately half the diameter of the eye, which is comparable to those of other vertebrates that are known to have highly retractable eyes. These highly protective features of the whale shark eye seem to emphasize the importance of vision for environmental perception, which contradicts the general, though poorly established, notion of low reliance on vision in this species.","[Tomita, Taketeru; Miyamoto, Kei] Okinawa Churashima Fdn, Okinawa Churashima Res Ctr, Motobu Cho, Okinawa, Japan; [Tomita, Taketeru; Murakumo, Kiyomi; Kino, Masakatsu; Miyamoto, Kei; Toda, Minoru] Okinawa Churashima Fdn, Okinawa Churaumi Aquarium, Motobu Cho, Okinawa, Japan; [Komoto, Shinya] Okinawa Inst Sci & Technol Grad Univ, Res Support Div, Imaging Sect, Okinawa, Japan; [Dove, Alistair] Georgia Aquarium, Atlanta, GA USA","Tomita, T (corresponding author), Okinawa Churashima Fdn, Okinawa Churashima Res Ctr, Motobu Cho, Okinawa, Japan.; Tomita, T (corresponding author), Okinawa Churashima Fdn, Okinawa Churaumi Aquarium, Motobu Cho, Okinawa, Japan.",t-tomita@okichura.jp,,"Dove, Alistair/0000-0003-3239-4772",,,,21,0,0,2,2,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",1932-6203,,,PLOS ONE,PLoS One,Jun-29,2020,15,6,,,,,,,e0235342,10.1371/journal.pone.0235342,,,9,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,MG9OL,WOS:000546361900004,32598385,"DOAJ Gold, Green Published",,,9/10/20

The scientific community largely supports management policies focusing on sustainable fisheries exploitation of sharks, but many concerned members of the public and some environmental advocates believe that sustainable shark fisheries cannot and do not exist and therefore support total bans on all shark fisheries and/or trade in shark products. The belief that sustainable shark fisheries cannot and do not exist persists despite scientific evidence showing that they can and do, and are important to livelihoods. Additionally, many concerned members of the public are only aware of one threat to sharks and are unaware of other threats-or of most available policy solutions.

For the purposes of establishing seafood consumption advisories with regard to methylmercury (MeHg) content, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) classifies Spiny Dogfish as sharks, an overly broad taxonomic grouping with a mean MeHg content of 0.98 mu g/g wet weight. Because the FDA mean includes fishes of different species that have been collected internationally over the last four decades, there is reason to believe that the FDA mean value is not reflective of the fish harvested in the Spiny Dogfish fishery. To evaluate how closely Spiny Dogfish match the values in the FDA's generic shark category, we collected muscle samples from 102 commercially harvested Spiny Dogfish caught off Cape Cod, Massachusetts, during the 2018 fishing season. Among the fish we sampled, 100% had MeHg concentrations lower than the FDA mean for sharks and 77.5% had MeHg concentrations that the FDA considers safe for consumption at a frequency of once per week. The mean MeHg concentration in our samples was 0.378 mu g/g wet weight, less than half of the value for the generic shark category. Moreover, through a comparison with data from the 1970s, we documented a 30% decline in MeHg concentrations for select size categories of Spiny Dogfish captured off the coast of New England. Exposure simulations indicated that to minimize risk, Spiny Dogfish should be consumed no more than twice per month by most people.","[Maynard, George A.] Cape Cod Commercial Fishermens Alliance, 1566 Main St, Chatham, MA 02633 USA; [Baumann, Zofia] Univ Connecticut, Sch Marine Sci, 1080 Shennecossett Rd, Groton, CT 06340 USA","Maynard, GA (corresponding author), Cape Cod Commercial Fishermens Alliance, 1566 Main St, Chatham, MA 02633 USA.",galphonsemaynard@gmail.com,,"Baumann, Zofia/0000-0002-1641-0202; Maynard, George/0000-0003-4246-2345",National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Saltonstall-Kennedy Program [NA16NMF4270234],"Captains G.

As with other shark-seal hotspots, movements to and from terrestrial haul outs can be risky for gray seals, thereby eliciting antipredator strategies. We investigated the movement and coastal behavior of gray seals on Cape Cod (USA) in relation to seasonal and diel changes in white shark activity. Analyzing 412 trips to sea by 8 seals and more than 25000 acoustic detections from 23 individual white sharks, we observed seasonally homogeneous movements in seal behavior during months with greater shark presence. During riskier months, seal behavior manifested in near-exclusive nocturnal foraging, reduced offshore ranging, and limited at-sea activity. On these nocturnal trips to sea, seals returning to haul outs tended to avoid daybreak and traversed during diel minima in shark activity. However, seals tended to depart haul outs at dusk when shark presence was maximal. As conservation efforts succeed in rebuilding depleted populations of coastal predators, studying re-emerging predator-prey interactions can enhance our understanding about the drivers of movement and behavior.","[Moxley, Jerry H.; Halpin, Patrick; Johnston, David W.] Duke Univ, Nicholas Sch Environm, Div Marine Sci & Conservat, Marine Lab, Beaufort, NC 28516 USA; [Skomal, Gregory; Chisholm, John] Massachusetts Div Marine Fisheries, New Bedford, MA 02744 USA; [Halpin, Patrick] Duke Univ, Nicholas Sch Environm, Div Marine Sci & Conservat, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Moxley, Jerry H.] Monterey Bay Aquarium, Conservat Res, Monterey, CA 93940 USA","Moxley, JH (corresponding author), Duke Univ, Nicholas Sch Environm, Div Marine Sci & Conservat, Marine Lab, Beaufort, NC 28516 USA.; Moxley, JH (corresponding author), Monterey Bay Aquarium, Conservat Res, Monterey, CA 93940 USA.",jerry.moxley@gmail.com,,"Johnston, David/0000-0003-2424-036X",Bureau of Ocean Energy Management; International Fund for Animal Welfare; Oak Foundation; Federal Aid in Sport Fish Restoration; John J.

In bigeye thresher sharks, the subcutaneous position of the red, aerobic swimming muscles (RM) suggests that RM temperature mirrors ambient during dives (i.e., ectothermy). In swordfish, the RM is closer to the vertebrae and its associated with vascular counter-current heat exchangers that maintain RM temperature above ambient (i.e., RM endothermy). Here, we sought to determine how exposure to a wide range of ambient temperatures (8, 16, 24 degrees C) impacted peak power output and optimum cycle (i.e., tailbeat) frequency (0.25, 0.5, 1 Hz) in RM isolated from both species. Bigeye thresher shark RM did not produce substantial power at high cycle frequencies, even at high temperatures; but it did produce relatively high power at slow cycle frequencies regardless of temperature. Swordfish RM produced more power when operating at a combination of fast cycle frequencies and higher temperatures. This suggests that swordfish RM benefits considerably more from warming than bigeye thresher shark RM, while the RM of both species was able to produce power at cold temperatures and slow cycle frequencies. Despite different thermal strategies (i.e., ectothermy vs. RM endothermy), the ability of the RM to power sustained swimming during foraging-related search behaviors may contribute to the unique ability of these fishes to successfully exploit food resources in deep, cold water.","[Stoehr, Ashley A.; Bernal, Diego] Univ Massachusetts Dartmouth, Dartmouth, MA 02747 USA; [Donley, Jeanine M.] MiraCosta Coll, Oceanside, CA USA; [Aalbers, Scott A.; Sepulveda, Chugey] Pfleger Inst Environm Res, Oceanside, CA USA; [Syme, Douglas A.] Univ Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada","Stoehr, AA; Bernal, D (corresponding author), Univ Massachusetts Dartmouth, Dartmouth, MA 02747 USA.",astoehr@umassd.edu; dbernal@umassd.edu,,,"National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [IOS-1354593, 1354772]; University of Massachusetts Distinguished Doctoral Fellowship; National Science and Engineering Graduate Fellowship; Sigma Xi","This material is based on the work supported by the National Science Foundation under grants IOS-1354593 and 1354772.

This shark displays hormonally controlled bioluminescence in which melatonin (MT) and prolactin (PRL) trigger light emission, while alpha -melanocyte-stimulating hormone (alpha -MSH) and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) play an inhibitory role. The extraocular encephalopsin (Es-Opn3) was also hypothesized to act as a luminescence regulator. The majority of these compounds (MT, alpha -MSH, ACTH, opsin) are members of the rapid physiological colour change that regulates the pigment motion within chromatophores in metazoans. Interestingly, the lanternshark photophore comprises a specific iris-like structure (ILS), partially composed of melanophore-like cells, serving as a photophore shutter. Here, we investigated the role of (i) Es-Opn3 and (ii) actors involved in both MT and alpha -MSH/ACTH pathways on the shark bioluminescence and ILS cell pigment motions. Our results reveal the implication of Es-Opn3, MT, inositol triphosphate (IP3), intracellular calcium, calcium-dependent calmodulin and dynein in the ILS cell pigment aggregation. Conversely, our results highlighted the implication of the alpha -MSH/ACTH pathway, involving kinesin, in the dispersion of the ILS cell pigment. The lanternshark luminescence then appears to be controlled by the balanced bidirectional motion of ILS cell pigments within the photophore. This suggests a functional link between photoreception and photoemission in the photogenic tissue of lanternsharks and gives precious insights into the bioluminescence control of these organisms.","[Duchatelet, Laurent; Mallefet, Jerome] Univ Catholique Louvain UCLouvain, Marine Biol Lab, Earth & Life Inst, 3 Croix Sud, B-1348 Louvain La Neuve, Belgium; [Sugihara, Tomohiro; Koyanagi, Mitsumasa; Terakita, Akihisa] Osaka City Univ, Grad Sch Sci, Dept Biol & Geosci, Osaka 5588585, Japan; [Delroisse, Jerome] Univ Mons UMONS, Biol Marine Organisms & Biomimet, Res Inst Biosci, 23 Pl Parc, B-7000 Mons, Belgium; [Rezsohazy, Rene] Univ Catholique Louvain UCLouvain, Anim Mol & Cellular Biol, Louvain Inst Biomol Sci & Technol, 5 Croix Sud, B-1348 Louvain La Neuve, Belgium","Duchatelet, L (corresponding author), Univ Catholique Louvain UCLouvain, Marine Biol Lab, Earth & Life Inst, 3 Croix Sud, B-1348 Louvain La Neuve, Belgium.",laurent.duchatelet@uclouvain.be,,,"Fonds de la Recherche Scientifique (FRS-FNRS, Belgium)Fonds de la Recherche Scientifique - FNRS [T.0169.20]","We would like to thank T.

These studies describe a species that occupies highly variable and complex habitats. However, uncertainty remains as to whether the proposed movement patterns are representative of the wider population. Here, we tagged 103 immature Australasian white sharks (147-350cm fork length) with both acoustic and satellite transmitters to expand our current knowledge of population linkages, spatiotemporal dynamics and coastal habitats. Eighty-three sharks provided useable data. Based on individual tracking periods of up to 5 years and a total of 2,865 days of tracking data, we were able to characterise complex movement patterns over similar to 45 degrees of latitude and similar to 72 degrees of longitude and distinguish regular/recurrent patterns from occasional/exceptional migration events. Shark movements ranged from Papua New Guinea to sub-Antarctic waters and to Western Australia, highlighting connectivity across their entire Australasian range. Results over the 12-year study period yielded a comprehensive characterisation of the movement ecology of immature Australasian white sharks across multiple spatial scales and substantially expanded the body of knowledge available for population assessment and management.","[Spaet, Julia L.

This study represents the first description of diet composition for one of the largest European rajid, the blue skateDipturuscf.flossada. A total of 346 specimens collected in the Celtic Sea from 2012 to 2015 were analysed for their gut content, with respect to individual total length, maturity stage and sex. Overall, the blue skate diet mainly consisted of shrimps and prawns, crabs and teleost fishes. Nonmetric multidimensional scaling and ANOSIM analyses revealed major ontogenetic shifts in the feeding strategy that were related to size and maturity, but not to sex. Shrimps and prawns, mostly composed ofCrangon allmanni, dominated the diet of small and immature individuals, while mod-size skate primarily preyed on crabs. The prevalence of crustaceans decreased with size and maturity, and was gradually replaced by teleost fishes in large mature individuals. A concomitant increase of the trophic level with size revealed that large blue skate become a top predator within the ecosystem. These results highlight the need to include ontogenetic changes in the diet description. As individuals grow and mature, blue skates can play a fundamental role in the structure of the Celtic Sea food web.","[Brown-Vuillemin, Sarah; Barreau, Thomas; Caraguel, Jean-Marie] Museum Natl Hist Nat, Stn Marine Concarneau, Pl Croix, F-29900 Concarneau, France; [Iglesias, Samuel P.] Univ Antilles, Sorbonne Univ, Museum Natl Hist Nat, Inst Syst Evolut Biodivers,CNRS,EPHE,Stn Marine C, Concarneau, France","Brown-Vuillemin, S (corresponding author), Museum Natl Hist Nat, Stn Marine Concarneau, Pl Croix, F-29900 Concarneau, France.",sarah.brownvuillemin@gmail.com,,"Brown-Vuillemin, Sarah/0000-0002-8010-7099",France Filiere Peche,This work was supported by France Filiere Peche.,,45,0,0,4,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-1112,1095-8649,,J FISH BIOL,J.

Total volatile basic nitrogen (TVB-N), thiobarbituric acid (TBA), pH,Kvalue, drip loss, and sensory evaluation scores were measured as deterioration indexes. Results show that coating by 1% of chitosan solutions containing 0.0%-0.8% of PSC significantly improved most deterioration indexes. Coating by 1% of chitosan solution containing 0.8% of PSC yielded the best results forKvalue, drip loss, and sensory evaluation, although the other indexes show no clear PSC concentration dependence. These results indicate 1% of chitosan solution containing 0.8% of PSC as the best coating formulation examined in this study. Practical applications Aquatic products have high contents of water and protein. Their qualities are likely to decline because of endogenous chemical and enzyme reactions, and also because of the role of spoilage and pathogenic microorganisms during storage. The edible collagen and chitosan coating suggested by this research is biodegradable, biocompatible, cost effective, and is able to meet the requirements for food quality and storage duration. Pepsin soluble collagen (PSC) is an aquatic product processing by-product that makes the maximum use of resources. As described herein, a composite formulation comprising collagen and chitosan improves preservation effects of different types of coatings. A more high-quality and effective edible coating formulation was obtained, thereby extending the red porgy fillet shelf life.","[Liu, Jinyan; Liu, Fangfang; Lu, Qi; Bao, Jianqiang] Shanghai Ocean Univ, Coll Food Sci & Technol, Shanghai 201306, Peoples R China; [Shibata, Mario; Ma, Qingbao; Hagiwara, Tomoaki] Tokyo Univ Marine Sci & Technol, Grad Sch Marine Sci & Technol, Tokyo 1088477, Japan; [Shan, Qianyi] Shanghai Inst Qual Inspect & Tech Res, Natl Food Qual Supervis & Inspect Ctr, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Bao, Jianqiang] Shanghai Engn Res Ctr Aquat Prod Proc & Preservat, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Bao, Jianqiang] Minist Agr, Lab Qual & Safety Risk Assessment Aquat Prod Stor, Shanghai, Peoples R China","Bao, JQ (corresponding author), Shanghai Ocean Univ, Coll Food Sci & Technol, Shanghai 201306, Peoples R China.; Hagiwara, T (corresponding author), Tokyo Univ Marine Sci & Technol, Grad Sch Marine Sci & Technol, Tokyo 1088477, Japan.",tomoaki@kaiyodai.ac.jp; baojq@shou.edu.cn,,,Oversea Quality-assured Education in Asian Nations for Ocean University Students (OQEANOUS); Tokyo University of Marine Science and Technology; Shanghai Ocean University; Shanghai collaborative innovation center of aquatic animal genetics and breeding center [ZF1206]; Construction of engineering center of Shanghai science and technology commission [11DZ2280300],"Oversea Quality-assured Education in Asian Nations for Ocean University Students (OQEANOUS), Tokyo University of Marine Science and Technology and Shanghai Ocean University.

These mass-reproduced images reached a wide public both within and outside Australia. They dramatized settler-colonial life and shaped relationships of human and nonhuman beings in the oceanic environment of the expanding marine city of Sydney. Consumed in the context of empire, they formed part of a vast record that gave visible form to the remote, the strange and often the feared dimensions of colonial life. As this article shows, the careful selection of images and their juxtaposition within texts about everyday settler-colonial life served the purpose of an imaginary museum of local history.

Because of the proximity to the port of Djibouti that is located along one of the busiest shipping areas in the world, whale sharks are potentially exposed to relatively high levels of trace elements and organochlorines. To assess their contamination status, concentrations of 15 trace elements, DDTs and PCBswere concurrently assessed for the first time in skin biopsies of 20 whale sharks. Additionally, 12 zooplankton samples were collected and analyzed for trace elements content. Concentration of As, Cu, Zn and Se were higher than in previous studies on this species. Whale shark samples exceeded themaximumallowable limits for foodstuffs for Cr, Pb Se, Cd and Zn. Results fromthis study suggests that Cr, Ni andMomay biomagnify in this species. With regard to PCBs, the predominant congenerwere Tetra-CB, accounting for 41% of total PCBs and Penta-CB for 23%, while for DDTs, the predominant metabolite was DDE contributing for 51% of total compounds. The maximum residue limit for DDTs and for the ind-PCBs in fish set by U.S. EPA and by the EU regulation, respectively, was exceeded in 62% of whale sharks. Moreover, the p,p'DDE/SDDT ratios were higher than the critical value of 0.6, indicating possible recent inputs of technicalDDTs in the area.

This study reviews the phylogenetic relationships of species of Scyliorhinus in the subfamily Scyliorhininae. Specimens of all Scyliorhinus species were examined as well as specimens of four of the 18 species of Cephaloscyllium, two species of Poroderma, representatives of almost all other catshark (scyliorhinid) genera and one proscylliid (Proscyllium habereri). A detailed morphological study, including external and internal morphology, morphometry and meristic data, was performed. From this study, a total of 84 morphological characters were compiled into a data matrix. Parsimony analysis was employed to generate hypotheses of phylogenetic relationships using the TNT 1.1. Proscyllium habereri was used to root the cladogram. The phylogenetic analysis, based on implied weighting (k = 3; 300 replications and 100 trees saved per replication), resulted in three equally most parsimonious cladograms with 233 steps, with a CI of 0.37 and an RI of 0.69. The monophyly of the subfamily Scyliorhininae is supported as well as of the genus Scyliorhinus, which is proposed to be the sister group of Cephaloscyllium. The phylogenetic relationships amongst Scyliorhinus species are presented for the first time.","[Soares, Karla D.

Slow growth and low fecundity make many species vulnerable to overfishing, but increased demand for gill rakers in traditional Chinese medicine and elasmobranch meat means exploitation continues. In response, protection has increased, with manta and devilrays (Mobulidae) and sawfishes (Pristidae) now listed on Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES). This protection requires an accurate assay for species identification, even when parts of the body have been removed or products have been processed. Therefore, we developed and tested a new COI minibarcode to identify ray species among processed samples. This assay was tested on 25 samples from across four batoid orders and showed consistent amplification. In 68% of cases, a correct top match was identified on GenBank and BOLD, but its accuracy should be much higher (particularly due to extensive taxonomic revisions in this group). Bioinformatic analysis of existing sequences also showed 81% of minibarcodes were matched back to a single species and 100% correctly back to all other taxonomic ranks. This increased to 91% when only including records published in the previous 2 years (that should help to account for recent taxonomic revisions). Analysis of skate 'wings' and cooked samples was highly successful, allowing the unambiguous identification of species. These results suggest this minibarcode will be highly useful in identifying ray species and could have a range of applications from the analysis of processed products to investigations of environmental DNA, making them an effective tool in the conservation of endangered batoids.","[Wannell, Gregory J.; Griffiths, Andrew M.; Fraser, Bonnie] Univ Exeter, Dept Biosci, Hatherly Bldg,Prince Wales Rd, Exeter EX4 4PS, Devon, England; [Spinou, Anastasia; Papadopoulos, Athanasios, I] Aristotle Univ Thessaloniki, Dept Biol, Thessaloniki 54124, Greece; [Batista, Romina] Museu Paraense Emilio Goeldi, Coordenacao Zool, Lab Biol Mol, BR-66077830 Belem, Para, Brazil; [Mendonca, Marina Barreira] Museu Paraense Emilio Goeldi, Programa Capacitacao Inst PCI, Ave Perimetral 1901, BR-66077530 Belem, Para, Brazil; [Wosiacki, Wolmar Benjamin] Museu Paraense Emilio Goeldi, Caixa Postal 399, BR-66040170 Belem, Para, Brazil; [Wintner, Sabine] KwaZulu Natal Sharks Board, Private Bag 2, ZA-4320 Umhlanga Rocks, Kzn, South Africa; [Wintner, Sabine] Univ KwaZulu Natal, Sch Life Sci, ZA-4000 Durban, South Africa; [Krey, Grigorios; Gubili, Chrysoula] Hellen Agr Org, Fisheries Res Inst, Nea Peramos 64007, Kavala, Greece","Gubili, C (corresponding author), Hellen Agr Org, Fisheries Res Inst, Nea Peramos 64007, Kavala, Greece.",c.gubili@googlemail.com,"Wosiacki, Wolmar/I-1724-2012; Gubili, Chrysoula/AAY-7167-2020; Batista, Romina/J-8282-2014","Wosiacki, Wolmar/0000-0002-4013-8501; Batista, Romina/0000-0002-7030-5227","Save Our Seas Foundation [2019-86213]; FINEp Parque analitico do MPEG [0118003100]; MCTIC/CNPq [444338/2018-7, 301339/2020-1]",Chrysoula Gubili was funded by Save Our Seas Foundation (2019-86213).

For example, shark T cells associate alpha (TCR-alpha) or delta (TCR-delta) constant (C) regions with Ig heavy chain (H) variable (V) segments or TCR-associated Ig-like V (TAILV) segments to form chimeric IgV-TCR, and combine TCR delta C with both Ig-like and TCR-like V segments to form the doubly rearranging NAR-TCR. Activation-induced (cytidine) deaminase-catalyzed somatic hypermutation (SHM), typically used for B-cell affinity maturation, also is used by TCR-alpha during selection in the shark thymus presumably to salvage failing receptors. Here, we found that the use of SHM by nurse shark TCR varies depending on the particular V segment or C region used. First, SHM significantly alters alpha/delta V (TCR alpha delta V) segments using TCR alpha C but not delta C. Second, mutation to IgHV segments associated with TCR delta C was reduced compared to mutation to TCR alpha delta V associated with TCR alpha C. Mutation was present but limited in V segments of all other TCR chains including NAR-TCR. Unexpectedly, we found preferential rearrangement of the noncanonical IgHV-TCR delta C over canonical TCR alpha delta V-TCR delta C receptors. The differential use of SHM may reveal how activation-induced (cytidine) deaminase targets V regions.","[Ott, Jeannine A.; Harrison, Jenna; Criscitiello, Michael F.] Texas A&M Univ, Coll Vet Med & Biomed Sci, Dept Vet Pathobiol, Comparat Immunogenet Lab, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Flajnik, Martin F.] Univ Maryland Baltimore, Sch Med, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Baltimore, MD USA; [Criscitiello, Michael F.] Texas A&M Univ, Texas A&M Hlth Sci Ctr, Coll Med, Dept Microbial Pathogenesis & Immunol, College Stn, TX 77843 USA","Criscitiello, MF (corresponding author), Texas A&M Univ, Coll Vet Med & Biomed Sci, Dept Vet Pathobiol, Comparat Immunogenet Lab, College Stn, TX 77843 USA.; Criscitiello, MF (corresponding author), Texas A&M Univ, Texas A&M Hlth Sci Ctr, Coll Med, Dept Microbial Pathogenesis & Immunol, College Stn, TX 77843 USA.",mcriscitiello@cvm.tamu.edu,,, [NSF IOS 1257829];  [IOS-1656870],"We thank the efforts of Kaitlyn Romoser and Ruth Scego for their persistence in sequencing and then annotating hundreds of T cell receptor sequences and the Comparative Immunogenetics Lab at Texas A&M University (Christian Mitchell, Minal Jamsandekar, Brooke Norwood, and Omar Manzur) for their helpful edits.

Its distinctive features include the suboccipital muscles, described for the first time, the absence of the palatoquadrate symphysis, a longitudinally extended mouth, and teeth unsuited for dissecting prey in typical method of modern sharks, which is cutting motions powered by head shaking from side to side. The palatoquadrate cartilages ofH. perloand closely related Hexanchidae articulate with theneurocraniumvia orbital and postorbital articulations, which together allow for lateral expansion of the jaws, but restrict retraction and protraction. We interpret these features as an adaptation to a different method of prey dissection, that is, ripping in a backward pull. It employs the specific postorbital articulation together with the suboccipital muscles as force-transmitting devices, and is powered by swimming muscles which produce a rearward thrust of the tail. During this type of dissection, the anterior part of the vertebral column should experience a tensile stress which explains the replacement of rigid vertebral bodies by a collagenous sheath around the notochord inH. perlo. The backward-ripping dissection could have been common among ancient Elasmobranchii based on the similarly developed postorbital articulation, a longitudinally extended mouth, and the absence of the palatoquadrate symphysis. A biomechanical comparison with the extinctPucapampellaindicates that ancient elasmobranchs could be also specialized in the backward-ripping prey dissection, but their mechanism was different from that inferred forH. perlo. We suggest that in the early evolution of sharks this mechanism was replaced by head-shaking dissection and then later was restored inH. perloon a new morphological basis. A new position of the postorbital articulation below the vertebral axis is fraught with the braincase elevation when backward ripping the prey, and as a counter-mean, requires formation of suboccipital portions of the axial musculature unknown in other sharks. Homology and origin of these portions is considered.","[Kryukova, Nadezhda V.] Russian Acad Sci, Severtsov Inst Ecol & Evolut, Moscow 119071, Russia; [Kuznetsov, Alexander N.] Russian Acad Sci, Borissiak Paleontol Inst, Moscow, Russia","Kryukova, NV (corresponding author), Russian Acad Sci, Severtsov Inst Ecol & Evolut, Moscow 119071, Russia.",nsterna@gmail.com,,,Russian Foundation for Basic ResearchRussian Foundation for Basic Research (RFBR) [18-04-01301],"Russian Foundation for Basic Research, Grant/Award Number: 18-04-01301",,59,0,0,0,0,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0362-2525,1097-4687,,J MORPHOL,J.

Presence of denser water on the inner continental shelf results in a cross-shelf density gradient that drives a gravitational circulation with offshore transport of denser water along the sea bed that is defined as Dense Shelf Water Cascade (DSWC). Analysis of field data, collected from multiple ocean glider data missions around Australia, confirmed that under a range of wind and tidal conditions, DSWC was a regular occurrence during autumn and winter months over a coastline spanning>10,000km. It is shown that even in the presence of relatively high wind- and tidal-induced vertical mixing, DSWCs were present due to the strength of the cross-shelf density gradient. The occurrence of DSWC around Australia is unique with continental scale forcing through air-sea fluxes that overcome local wind and tidal forcing. It is shown that DSWC acts as a conduit to transport suspended material across the continental shelf and is a critical process that influences water quality on the inner continental shelf.","[Mahjabin, Tanziha] Univ Western Australia, Oceans Grad Sch, Perth, WA 6009, Australia; Univ Western Australia, UWA Oceans Inst, Perth, WA 6009, Australia","Mahjabin, T (corresponding author), Univ Western Australia, Oceans Grad Sch, Perth, WA 6009, Australia.",tanzihamahjabintrina@ymail.com,"; Pattiaratchi, Charitha/E-6916-2011","Mahjabin, Tanziha/0000-0003-3926-9106; Hetzel, Yasha/0000-0003-3307-2011; Pattiaratchi, Charitha/0000-0003-2229-6183",Scholarship International Research Fees (SIRF); University International Stipend; University Postgraduate Award; Ad Hoc Postgraduate Scholarship,"All ocean glider data used in this paper were sourced from Australia's Integrated Marine Observing System (IMOS) data portal (https://portal.aodn.org.au/).

The material is referred to the extant elasmobranch Family Squatinidae on the basis of several distinctive morphological features. It also exhibits features not shared by any modern or fossil Squatina species or the extinct Late Jurassic squatinid Pseudorhina. A new genus and species is erected, despite there being some uncertainty regarding potential synonymy with existing nominal species previously founded on isolated fossil teeth (curiously, no squatinid teeth have been documented from the HSPS). A preliminary phylogenetic analysis suggests that the new genus falls on the squatinid stem, phylogenetically closer to Squatina than Pseudorhina. The craniovertebral articulation in the new genus exhibits features considered convergent with modern batomorphs (skates and rays), including absence of contact between the posterior basicranium and first vertebral centrum, and a notochordal canal which fails to reach the parachordal basicranium. Supporting evidence that similarities in the craniovertebral articulation of squatinoids and batomorphs are convergent rather than synapomorphic (as hypnosqualeans) is presented by an undescribed Early Jurassic batomorph, in which an occipital hemicentrum articulates with the first vertebral centrum as in all modem sharklike (selachimorph) elasmobranchs. The fossil suggests instead that the batomorph synarcual evolved by fusion of the anterior basiventral and basidorsal cartilages prior to the reduction of the anterior centra and loss of the occipital hemicentrum, not afterward as predicted by the hypnosqualean hypothesis.","[Maisey, John G.] Amer Museum Nat Hist, Dept Vertebrate Paleontol, New York, NY 10024 USA; [Ehret, Dana J.] New Jersey State Museum, 205 West State St, Trenton, NJ USA; [Denton, John S.

The overall tooth morphology ofO. bruniensisis similar to those of other closely related members in the order Squaliformes, as is the tissue arrangement, or histotype.Oxynotus bruniensisexhibits a simplified enameloid microstructure, which we compare with previously documented enameloid microstructures of other elasmobranchs. Though subtle interspecific differences in dental characters are documented, neither overall tooth morphology nor histotype and microstructure are unique toO. bruniensis. We conclude that in the case ofO. bruniensis, dietary specialization is facilitated by behavioral rather than morphological specialization.","[Moyer, Joshua K.; Irschick, Duncan J.] Univ Massachusetts, Grad Program Organism & Evolutionary Biol, 230 Stockbridge Rd, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; [Finucci, Brittany] Natl Inst Water & Atmospher Res, Wellington, New Zealand; [Riccio, Mark L.] Carl Zeiss Microscopy Inc, Thornwood, NY USA; [Irschick, Duncan J.] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Biol, Amherst, MA 01003 USA","Moyer, JK (corresponding author), Univ Massachusetts, Grad Program Organism & Evolutionary Biol, 230 Stockbridge Rd, Amherst, MA 01003 USA.",jkmoyer@umass.edu,,"Finucci, Brittany/0000-0003-1315-2946",Jane H.

In ram feeding piscivores, a pattern of monognathic heterodonty has been observed where tooth size either increases posteriorly (Scomberomorus maculatus), or anteriorly (Carcharhinus limbatus), with exceptions such asTrichiurus lepturusandSphyraena barracudawhich have large anterior fangs. Tooth size and placement, as related to prey capture, was examined in Atlantic Spanish Mackerel (S. maculatus), Great Barracuda (S. barracuda), Atlantic Cutlassfish (T. lepturus), and the Blacktip shark (C. limbatus) by quantifying tooth occlusion along the jaw. Percent gape at occlusion inS. maculatusdecreased anteriorly in a linear fashion, indicating occlusion from posterior to anterior. Therefore, prey initially contact the posterior teeth with high puncture pressure during high velocity strikes, capitalizing the region of greatest bite force. ForS. barracudaandT. lepturus, posterior teeth and premaxillary fangs occlude at similar percent gapes (within 10%). The premaxillary fangs are likely used for initial capture due to the high angular velocity of the anterior section of the jaw and then for cutting, due to their laterally compressed shape. InC. limbatusall teeth occluded within a narrow range of 1.4-8.8% gape, indicating that all teeth meet at almost complete jaw closure. Simultaneous puncture of teeth prevents prey escape while maximizing the cutting area during head shaking. Thus, various tooth size and dentition patterns may yield similar success in prey capture, serving the same function.","[Carr, Emily M.; Motta, Philip J.] Univ S Florida, Dept Integrat Biol, 4202 East Fowler Ave, Tampa, FL 33620 USA","Carr, EM (corresponding author), Univ S Florida, Dept Integrat Biol, 4202 East Fowler Ave, Tampa, FL 33620 USA.",emilycarr1@mail.usf.edu; motta@usf.edu,,"Carr, Emily/0000-0001-7985-863X",Porter Family Foundation,"This work was in-part supported by the Porter Family Foundation grant to EC.

Bionic (shark skin) structure was replicated on the outer layer of PDMS membranes to form the super-hydrophobic surface for inhibiting the bacteria adhesion. Furthermore, the zwitterionic polymer (2-methacryloyloxyethyl phosphorylcholine, MPC) brushes were immobilized on the internal layer of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) modified PDMS membranes by the atmospheric plasma-induce polymerization for enhancing wound repairs and absorbing the wound exudates. The characteristics of the bionic functionalized PDMS membranes were evaluated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive Xray spectroscopy (EDS), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), contact angle (CA) measurement, and Xray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The results indicate that the bionic outer layer of PDMS membrane exhibited super-hydrophobic surface (CA: > 120 degrees) by shark skin replica, whereas the internal layer displayed super-hydrophilic surface (CA:< 10 degrees), due to the immobilization of PMPC polymer brushes on the PVA-modified PDMS membrane. Therefore, the bionic outer layer of PDMS membranes could not only avoid the external bacteria adhesion to protect the wound, but also PMPC and PVA modified internal layer can improve the hydrophilicity and biocompatibility to hasten the wound repairs.","[Lin, Yen-Ting; Ting, Yi-Shao; Chen, Bo-Yu; Cheng, Yu-Wei; Liu, Ting-Yu] Ming Chi Univ Technol, Dept Mat Engn, New Taipei 24301, Taiwan","Cheng, YW; Liu, TY (corresponding author), Ming Chi Univ Technol, Dept Mat Engn, New Taipei 24301, Taiwan.",louischengblue@gmail.com; tyliu0322@gmail.com,,"Liu, Ting-Yu/0000-0003-2309-6167","Research Center for Intelligent Medical Devices of Ming Chi University of Technology; Ministry of Science and Technology of TaiwanMinistry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [MOST 108-2218-E-002- 010, MOST 108-2622-E-131-002-CC3]","This work was financially supported by Research Center for Intelligent Medical Devices of Ming Chi University of Technology, and Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan (MOST 108-2218-E-002- 010 and MOST 108-2622-E-131-002-CC3).",,37,1,1,38,38,ELSEVIER SCIENCE SA,LAUSANNE,"PO BOX 564, 1001 LAUSANNE, SWITZERLAND",0257-8972,,,SURF COAT TECH,Surf.

The skin of Chondrichthyes fishes is covered in dermal denticles, whereas Osteichthyes fishes are covered in scales and are mucous rich. The divergence time among these two fish groups is hypothesized to result in predictable variation among symbionts. Here, using shotgun metagenomics, we test if patterns of diversity in the skin surface microbiome across the two fish clades match predictions made by phylosymbiosis theory. We hypothesize (1) the skin microbiome will be host and clade-specific, (2) evolutionary difference in elasmobranch and teleost will correspond with a concomitant increase in host-microbiome dissimilarity, and (3) the skin structure of the two groups will affect the taxonomic and functional composition of the microbiomes. Results We show that the taxonomic and functional composition of the microbiomes is host-specific. Teleost fish had lower average microbiome within clade similarity compared to among clade comparison, but their composition is not different among clade in a null based model. Elasmobranch's average similarity within clade was not different than across clade and not different in a null based model of comparison. In the comparison of host distance with microbiome distance, we found that the taxonomic composition of the microbiome was related to host distance for the elasmobranchs, but not the teleost fishes. In comparison, the gene function composition was not related to the host-organism distance for elasmobranchs but was negatively correlated with host distance for teleost fishes. Conclusion Our results show the patterns of phylosymbiosis are not consistent across both fish clades, with the elasmobranchs showing phylosymbiosis, while the teleost fish are not. The discrepancy may be linked to alternative processes underpinning microbiome assemblage, including possible historical host-microbiome evolution of the elasmobranchs and convergent evolution in the teleost which filter specific microbial groups. Our comparison of the microbiomes among fishes represents an investigation into the microbial relationships of the oldest divergence of extant vertebrate hosts and reveals that microbial relationships are not consistent across evolutionary timescales.","[Doane, Michael P.] Sydney Inst Marine Sci, Mosman, NSW, Australia; [Doane, Michael P.; Morris, Megan M.; Allen, Lauren; Haggerty, John M.; Johri, Shaili; Turnlund, Abigail C.; Peterson, Meredith; Hovel, Kevin; Ledbetter, Julia; Alker, Amanda; Avalos, Jackeline; Baker, Kristi; Bhide, Shruti; Billings, Emma; Clemens, Molly; Demery, Amelia Juliette; Lima, Lais Farias Oliveira; Gomez, Oscar; Gutierrez, Omar; Hinton, Selena; Kieu, Donald; Kim, Angie; Loaiza, Rebeca; Martinez, Alexander; McGhee, Jordan; Nguyen, Kristine; Parlan, Sabrina; Pham, Amanda; Edwards, Robert A.; Dinsdale, Elizabeth A.] San Diego State Univ, Dept Biol, San Diego, CA 92182 USA; [Morris, Megan M.] Stanford Univ, Dept Biol, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Papudeshi, Bhavya] Indiana Univ, Natl Ctr Genome Anal Support, San Diego, IN USA; [Pande, Dnyanada] San Diego State Univ, Comp Sci Dept, San Diego, CA 92182 USA; [Johri, Shaili] Stanford Univ, Hopkins Marine Stn, Pacific Grove, CA 93950 USA; [Turnlund, Abigail C.] Univ Queensland, Australian Ctr Ecogen, St Lucia, Qld, Australia; [Kacev, Dovi; Nosal, Andy] Univ Calif San Diego, Scripps Inst Oceanog, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Nosal, Andy] Univ San Diego, Dept Environm & Ocean Sci, San Diego, CA 92110 USA; [Ramirez, Deni] ConCiencia Mexico AC, Whale Shark Mexico, La Paz, BC, Mexico; [Byrum, Steven] Univ Florida, Dept Biol, Gainesville, FL USA; [Price-Waldman, Rosalyn] Princeton Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Edwards, Robert A.; Dinsdale, Elizabeth A.] San Diego State Univ, Viral Informat Inst, San Diego, CA 92182 USA","Dinsdale, EA (corresponding author), San Diego State Univ, Dept Biol, San Diego, CA 92182 USA.; Dinsdale, EA (corresponding author), San Diego State Univ, Viral Informat Inst, San Diego, CA 92182 USA.",Elizabeth_dinsdale@hotmail.com,,"dinsdale, elizabeth/0000-0002-2177-203X; Edwards, Robert/0000-0001-8383-8949",NSF Division of Undergraduate EducationNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF- Directorate for Education & Human Resources (EHR) [1323809]; NSF Division of Molecular and Cellular Science [1330800],We acknowledge support from S.

Implementation of local management initiatives within these hotspots is more achievable than developing effective conservation strategies that encompass their entire distributions. Such measures have the potential for disproportionate population-level benefits but rely on a detailed understanding of spatiotemporal habitat use. To that end, we examined the residency and small-scale habitat use of 51 whale sharks (Rhincodon typus) over 5 years at an aggregation site in Tanzania using passive acoustic telemetry. Whale sharks were highly resident within and across years, with a combined maximum residency index of 0.39. Although fewer sharks were detected from March to September, residency was high throughout the year. Ancillary photographic-identification data showed that individual residency persisted before and after tag attachment. Kernel utilization distributions (KUD) and movement networks both revealed the same spatiotemporal pattern of habitat use, with a small core habitat (50% KUD area for all sharks combined = 12.99 km(2)) that predictably changed on a seasonal basis. Activity spaces did not differ with time of day, sex, or size of the sharks, indicating a population-level pattern driven by prey availability. The small and predictable core habitat area at this site means that site-based management options to reduce shark injuries and mortality from boat strike and fishing gear entanglement can be spatially targeted for maximum effectiveness and compliance by human users.","[Rohner, Christoph A.; Prebble, Clare E.

This difference in respiratory physiology raises the question: What are the implications of these differences in lifestyle for circadian rhythms? We investigated the diel activity patterns of 5 species of sharks, including 3 ram ventilating species: the school shark (Galeorhinus galeus), the spotted estuary smooth-hound (Mustelus lenticulatus), and the spiny dogfish (Squalus acanthias); and 2 buccal pumping species: the Port Jackson (Heterodontus portusjacksoni) and draughtsboard (Cephaloscyllium isabellum) sharks. We measured the amount, duration, and distance traveled while swimming over multiple days under a 12:12 light:dark light regime for all species and used modified light regimes for species with a clear diel rhythm in activity. We identified a surprising diversity of activity rhythms. The school shark and smooth-hound swam continuously; however, whereas the school shark swam at the same speed and covered the same distance during the day and night, the smooth-hound swam slower at night and traversed a shorter distance. A similar pattern was observed in the spiny dogfish, although this shark swam less overall. Both the Port Jackson and draughtsboard sharks showed a marked nocturnal preference for swimming. This pattern was muted and disrupted during constant light and constant dark regimes, although circadian organization of this pattern was maintained under certain conditions.

Many large MPAs are, however, impacted by illegal fishing activity conducted by unlicensed vessels. While enforcement of these reserves is often expensive, it would likely benefit from the integration of ecological data on the mobile animals they are designed to protect. Consequently, shark populations in some protected areas continue to decline, as they remain a prime target for illegal fishers. To understand shark movements and their vulnerability to illegal fishing, 3 years of acoustic tracking data, from 101 reef-associated sharks, were analysed as movement networks to explore the predictability of movement patterns and identify key movement corridors within the British Indian Ocean Territory (BIOT) MPA. We examined how space use and connectivity overlap with spatially explicit risk of illegal fishing, through data obtained from the management consultancy enforcing the MPA. Using individual-based models, the movement networks of two sympatric shark species were efficiently predicted with distance-decay functions (>95% movements accurately predicted). Model outliers were used to highlight the locations with unexpectedly high movement rates where MPA enforcement patrols might most efficiently mitigate predator removal. Activity space estimates and network metrics illustrate that silvertip sharks were more dynamic, less resident and link larger components of the MPA than grey reef sharks. However, we show that this behaviour potentially enhances their exposure to illegal fishing activity. Synthesis and applications. Marine protected area (MPA) enforcement strategies are often limited by resources. The British Indian Ocean Territory MPA, one of the world's largest 'no take' MPAs, has a single patrol vessel to enforce 640,000 km(2)of open ocean, atoll and reef ecosystems. We argue that to optimize the patrol vessel search strategy and thus enhance their protective capacity, ecological data on the space use and movements of desirable species, such as large-bodied reef predators, must be incorporated into management plans. Here, we use electronic tracking data to evaluate how shark movement dynamics influence species mortality trajectories in exploited reef ecosystems. In doing so we discuss how network analyses of such data might be applied for protected area enforcement.","[Jacoby, David M.

This species has been largely misidentified with S. mitsukurii. However, morphological, meristic and morphometric evidence support it to be a separate and undescribed species. Squalus shiraii sp. nov. differs from this species by having body brown in colour dorsally, caudal fin with ventral and dorsal tips markedly tapered and broadly white, dermal denticles uniscuspidate and lanceolate and larger number of precaudal (91-94) and total vertebrae (120-123) (vs. body dark grey to black; caudal fin with ventral and dorsal tips rounded and not white in colour; denticles tricuspidate and rhomboid; 86-90 precaudal and 116-117 total vertebrae). Squalus shiraii sp. nov. is also clearly separated from other Japanese congeners which are herein revisited to include six species, based on the examination of over 150 specimens caught from Japanese waters that were available in ichthyological collections: S. mitsukurii, S. japonicus, S. acutirostris, S. brevirostris and S. suckleyi. Squalus mitsukurii, S. japonicus and S. brevirostris are re-described in detail and the neotype of S. japonicus is herein designated. Squalus acutirostris is treated as a valid species with occurrences in Japan, China and Taiwan and, thus, a provisional diagnosis is given, as well as an updated diagnosis of S. suckleyi. A key to Squalus species from the North-western Pacific Ocean is given and main morphological differences between S. shiraii sp. nov. and the closest related species are discussed.","[Viana, Sarah T.

However, knowledge on the learning abilities of one of the oldest extant vertebrate groups, Chondrichthyes, remains limited. With the increasing interest in global wildlife tourism and shark feeding operations, it is important to understand the capacities of these animals to form associations between human activities and food. We used an operant conditioning regime with a simple spatial cognitive task to investigate the effects of reinforcement frequency and reward magnitude on the learning performance and memory retention of Port Jackson sharks (Heterodontus portusjacksoni). Twenty-four Port Jackson sharks were assigned one of four treatments differing in reward magnitude and reinforcement frequency (large magnitude-high frequency; large magnitude-low frequency; small magnitude-high frequency; small magnitude-low frequency). The sharks were trained over a 21-day period to compare the number of days that it took to learn to pass an assigned door to feed. Sharks trained at a high reinforcement frequency demonstrated faster learning rates and a higher number of passes through the correct door at the end of the trials, while reward magnitude had limited effects on learning rate. This suggests that a reduction in reinforcement frequency during tourism-related feeding operations is likely to be more effective in reducing the risk of sharks making associations with food than limiting the amount of food provided.","[Heinrich, Dennis D.

Accordingly, we studied the seasonal residency, catch abundance, and distribution of juvenileC. plumbeusin Winyah Bay, SC, as well as their migration patterns along the western North Atlantic. We set 303 bottom longlines from May through September in 2016 and 2017 and deployed 11 Vemco (V16-4H) acoustic transmitters in juvenileC. plumbeus. Catch abundance did not differ by month or year (p = 0.45) and was not significantly influenced by any tested water parameter (p = 0.58).C. plumbeuscatches were dominated by individuals measuring 81-100 cm precaudal length, and mean size only significantly differed by year (p = 0.02) with slightly larger sharks (86.8 cm PCL) caught in 2017 than 2016 (81.4 cm PCL). Tidal stage and Bay region were positively correlated with catches (p = 0.02). From August 2016 through January 2019, juveniles were detected in Winyah Bay from April to November for 1-302 non-consecutive days (mu +/- SE = 108.1 +/- 32.6 days), with six juveniles exhibiting interannual return. Detection frequency and presence differed by Bay region, with most detections nearshore and in Lower Bay, fewest in Middle Bay, and none in Upper Bay.

Although Helicobacter spp. infections are known to cause gastric ulcers and gastritis in humans and ferrets, it is unknown if the sea otter bacterium, H. enhydrae sp. nov., causes similar gastric pathology. Determining whether Helicobacter detection is associated with sea otter gastric pathology is the first step toward using this information to expedite diagnosis and treatment. We investigated the proportion of Helicobacter infections in 46 necropsied southern sea otters via quantitative realtime polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) of the 16S rRNA gene. Helicobacter DNA was detected in fresh-frozen and formalin-fixed gastric body and pyloric tissues using Helicobacter genus-specific 16S rRNA primers. Data from gross necropsy and histopathology were analyzed for associations between Helicobacter detection via qPCR and presence/absence of gastric pathology. ETEST (R) gradient strips were utilized to investigate antimicrobial minimum inhibitory concentrations for H. enhydrae isolates. Helicobacter spp. were detected in the gastric tissue of 85% of sea otters in this study. Fresh-frozen samples were more commonly Helicobacter qPCR-positive than formalin-fixed tissue, indicating variable sensitivity of detection in relation to postnecropsy tissue processing methods. Diagnosis of gastric ulcers at necropsy was significantly associated with Helicobacter qPCR detection in gastric mucosa (P = 0.005), while age, sex, presence of melena, shark trauma, and protozoal infection were not associated (P > 0.1). Helicobacter enhydrae isolates were sensitive to clarithromycin and tetracycline in vitro at physiologically relevant concentrations. Overall, this work suggests that Helicobacter spp. might be commonly found in southern sea otters, particularly those with ulcers, and that H. enhydrae can be treated with several commonly used anti-Helicobacter therapies.","[Batac, Francesca, I; Miller, Melissa A.] Calif Dept Fish & Wildlife, Off Spill Prevent & Response, Marine Wildlife Vet Care & Res Ctr, Santa Cruz, CA 95834 USA; [Batac, Francesca, I; Ottemann, Karen M.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Microbiol & Environm Toxicol, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Miller, Melissa A.; Moriarty, Megan E.] Univ Calif Davis, One Hlth Inst, Karen C Drayer Wildlife Hlth Ctr, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Shen, Zeli; Fox, James G.] MIT, Div Comparat Med, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA","Batac, FI (corresponding author), Calif Dept Fish & Wildlife, Off Spill Prevent & Response, Marine Wildlife Vet Care & Res Ctr, Santa Cruz, CA 95834 USA.; Batac, FI (corresponding author), Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Dept Microbiol & Environm Toxicol, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA.",francesca.batac@wildlife.ca.gov,,"Batac, Francesca/0000-0002-3187-059X",CDFW-MWVCRC; Department of Microbiology and Environmental Toxicology at UC Santa Cruz; California Sea Otter Fund; Oiled Wildlife Care Network Small Grant; Sea Otter Foundation; Trust Grant; Friends of Seymour Marine Discovery Center's Student Research and Education Award; American Association of University Women Re-Entry Scholarship; Marilyn C. and Raymond E.

Describing changes in the dimensions of biodiversity relative to spatiotemporal and environmental gradients facilitates more refined and integrated views of community dynamics. This study synthesized fisheries-independent bottom longline survey data collected from 1990 to 2018 to elucidate patterns in six inventory biodiversity indices across temporal, small-scale spatial, and thermal domains for the shark community inhabiting the Mid-Atlantic Bight. Model-based predictions over years showed marked increases since the mid-2000s in several indices and were suggestive of an expanding community in terms of species richness, biodiversity, relative abundance, functional traits, and size composition. Annual relative evenness predictions were fairly constant and indicative of persistent maintenance in the distribution of community abundance across taxa through time. Changes in the biodiversity indices were also evident across a fairly small spatial area and in response to bottom water temperature, although patterns were less prominent when compared to interannual trends. The results of this study complement single-species population analyses by providing a community-level perspective, and offer positive indications that the shark community off the U.S. east coast has become more robust over the past several years.","[Latour, Robert J.; Gartland, James] Virginia Inst Marine Sci, POB 1346, Gloucester Point, VA 23062 USA","Latour, RJ (corresponding author), Virginia Inst Marine Sci, POB 1346, Gloucester Point, VA 23062 USA.",latour@vims.edu,,"Latour, Robert/0000-0002-8644-1733","NOAA, Silver Spring, MD, USA [NA16NMF4720218]","Recent funding for VASMAP was provided by a grant to RJL by NOAA, Silver Spring, MD, USA (agency award # NA16NMF4720218).",,76,0,0,5,5,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0025-3162,1432-1793,,MAR BIOL,Mar.

The extremely elongate and highly flexible tail of thresher sharks provides an opportunity to characterize gradients in denticle surface characteristics along the length of the tail and assess correlations between denticle morphology and tail kinematics. We measured denticle morphology on the caudal fin of three mature and two embryo common thresher sharks (Alopias vulpinus), and we compared thresher tail denticles to those of eleven other shark species. Using surface profilometry, we quantified 3D-denticle patterning and texture along the tail of threshers (27 regions in adults, and 16 regions in embryos). We report that tails of thresher embryos have a membrane that covers the denticles and reduces surface roughness. In mature thresher tails, surfaces have an average roughness of 5.6 mu m which is smoother than some other pelagic shark species, but similar in roughness to blacktip, porbeagle, and bonnethead shark tails. There is no gradient down the tail in roughness for the middle or trailing edge regions and hence no correlation with kinematic amplitude or inferred magnitude of flow separation along the tail during locomotion. Along the length of the tail there is a leading-to-trailing-edge gradient with larger leading edge denticles that lack ridges (average roughness = 9.6 mu m), and smaller trailing edge denticles with 5 ridges (average roughness = 5.7 mu m). Thresher shark tails have many missing denticles visible as gaps in the surface, and we present evidence that these denticles are being replaced by new denticles that emerge from the skin below.","[Popp, Meagan; White, Connor F.; Wainwright, Dylan K.; Lauder, George V.] Harvard Univ, Dept Organism & Evolutionary Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Bernal, Diego] Univ Massachusetts Dartmouth, Dept Biol, Dartmouth, MA USA","Lauder, GV (corresponding author), Museum Comparat Zool, 26 Oxford St, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",glauder@oeb.harvard.edu,"White, Connor/O-1055-2016","White, Connor/0000-0001-8260-290X; Lauder, George/0000-0003-0731-286X; Popp, Meagan/0000-0003-0201-6420","National Oceanic and Atmospheric AdministrationNational Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA [NA16NMF4270231]; National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [IOS1354593, GRF DGE-1144152]; Office of Naval ResearchOffice of Naval Research [N00014-09-1-0352, N000141410533]","National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Grant/Award Number: NA16NMF4270231; National Science Foundation, Grant/Award Numbers: IOS1354593, GRF DGE-1144152; Office of Naval Research, Grant/Award Numbers: N00014-09-1-0352, N000141410533",,48,0,0,3,3,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0362-2525,1097-4687,,J MORPHOL,J.

To fully understand this phenomenon, an evolutionary challenge has risen during the last decades, away from human limits, driving the scientific quest into the wild life. The study of wild vertebrate populations in their natural habitats has shown that cancer is rather prominent. Thus, the diversity of vertebrates reported with some form of neoplasia is quite scattered through a variety of habitats. However, some species constitute exceptions by exhibiting cancer-protective features, driven by certain loci in their DNA. It is obvious that from an evolutionary standpoint, the incidence of cancer in different taxa is nowadays studied by seeking for patterns and their roots. The main purpose of the evolutionary approach is no other than to answer a fundamental question: Could cancer be ultimately regarded as another evolutionary force conducive to the formation or shaping-up of species?","[Kitsoulis, Christos V.; Baxevanis, Athanasios D.; Abatzopoulos, Theodore J.] Aristotle Univ Thessaloniki, Dept Genet Dev & Mol Biol, Sch Biol, Fac Sci, Thessaloniki 54124, Greece","Abatzopoulos, TJ (corresponding author), Aristotle Univ Thessaloniki, Dept Genet Dev & Mol Biol, Sch Biol, Fac Sci, Thessaloniki 54124, Greece.",abatzop@bio.auth.gr,,,,,,72,0,0,6,6,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",1790-045X,2241-5793,,J BIOL RES-THESSALON,J.

Mark-recapture surveys produced a minimum convex polygon (MCP) of 0.07 km(2) that was significantly larger than the MCP derived from acoustic telemetry (0.02 km(2)). Acoustic telemetry produced 50 and 95% kernel utilization densities that were smaller (0.02 km(2)) and larger (0.14 km(2)) than home range estimates from mark-recapture surveys, respectively. Home range estimates from this study are the smallest that have been documented for neonatal blacktip reef sharks, possibly owing to the study sites' proximity to deep channels.

According to the von Bertalanffy growth model, the results indicated that the species showed from three to seven cohorts annually and slow growth (W-i = 57.20%): L-infinity = 292.86 cm, K = 0.141 per year and t(0) = -2.26. Length of sexual maturity was 239.30 and 209.10 cm at first capture; the average natural mortality value was 0.231 per year, by fishing 0.051 per year with a total mortality of 0.26 1 per year and exploitation rate of 0.15. Interannual variability was recorded in biomass with an average of 7367.24 tonnes, as well as a spatial permanence pattern.

Sub-Antarctic fur seals Arctocephalus tropicalis are opportunistic and pelagic foragers that feed on a variety of fish, cephalopods, and crustaceans throughout their range. Penguins are also targeted, but to what extent remains uncertain, with only two records to date: Amsterdam Island, South Indian Ocean, where they kill and feed on northern rockhopper penguins Eudyptes moseleyi; and Gough Island, the southernmost island in the Tristan da Cunha archipelago, South Atlantic Ocean, where they are suspected to be significant predators of northern rockhopper penguins based on an unprecedented number of penguin carcasses (> 100) found floating at sea in 2011. We report the first documented records of such predations from the northern islands in the Tristan archipelago. Over three austral summers (2015-2017), northern rockhopper penguins with severe injuries were frequently observed at Nightingale Island. The cause of the wounds was unknown, but seal or shark attacks seemed probable. In January 2019, the first confirmed sighting of a sub-Antarctic fur seal, predating a healthy northern rockhopper penguin at sea off Nightingale Island was recorded. It remains uncertain whether the large A. tropicalis population at the Tristan da Cunha islands is significant predators of northern rockhopper penguins, but this could partly explain the significant recent decrease in northern rockhopper penguin population numbers.","[Bester, M.

These characteristics may induce complex population genetic structure patterns, with resulting implications for the management of exploited populations. The scalloped hammerhead, Sphyrna lewini, is a cosmopolitan, migratory shark in tropical and warm temperate waters, inhabiting coastal bays during parturition and juvenile development, and the open ocean as adults. Here, we investigated the genetic connectivity and diversity of S. lewini in the western Atlantic using large sample coverage (N = 308), and data from whole mitochondrial control region (mtCR) sequences and ten nuclear microsatellite markers We detected significant population genetic structure with both mtCR and microsatellites markers (mtCR: phi(ST) = 0.60; p < 0.001; microsatellites: D-est 0.0794, p = 0.001, F-ST = 0.046, p < 0.05), and isolation by distance (mtCR r = 0.363, p = 0.009; microsatellites markers r = 0.638, p = 0.007). Migration and gene flow patterns were asymmetric and female reproductive philopatry is postulated to explain population subdivisions. The notable population differentiation at microsatellites markers indicates low-levels of male-mediated gene flow in the western Atlantic. The overall effective population size was estimated as 299 (215-412 CI), and there was no evidence of strong or recent bottleneck effects. Findings of at least three management units, moderate genetic diversity, and low effective population size in the context of current overfishing calls for intensive management aimed at short and long-term conservation for this endangered species in the western Atlantic Ocean.","[Pinhal, Danillo] Univ Estadual Paulista UNESP, Inst Biociencias, Dept Genet, Lab Genom & Evolucao Mol, Rua Prof Doutor Antonio Celso Wagner Zanin S-N, BR-18618689 Botucatu, SP, Brazil; [Domingues, Rodrigo R.] Univ Fed Sao Paulo, UNIFESP, Inst Mar, Dept Ciencias Mar, Rua Carvalho de Mendonca 144, BR-11070100 Santos, SP, Brazil; [Bruels, Christine C.; Shivji, Mahmood S.] Save Our Seas Shark Res Ctr, Dania, FL USA; [Bruels, Christine C.; Shivji, Mahmood S.] Nova Southeastern Univ, Guy Harvey Res Inst, 8000 North Ocean Dr, Dania, FL 33004 USA; [Ferrette, Bruno L.

Nutrition plays a key mediatory role in species-environment interactions, yet descriptions of marine predators' diets are usually limited to the combinations of prey species consumed. Here we combined stomach contents analysis (n = 40), literature prey nutritional data and a multidimensional nutritional niche framework to establish the diet and niche breadths of white sharks (Carcharodon carcharias; mean +/- SD precaudal length = 187.9 +/- 46.4 cm, range = 123.8-369.0 cm) caught incidentally off New South Wales (NSW), Australia. Our nutritional framework also facilitated the incorporation of existing literature diet information for South African white sharks to further evaluate nutritional niches across populations and sizes. Although teleosts including pelagic eastern Australian salmon (Arripis trutta) were the predominant prey for juvenile white sharks in NSW, the diversity of benthic and reef-associated species and batoids suggests regular benthic foraging. Despite a small sample size (n = 18 and 19 males and females, respectively), there was evidence of increased batoid consumption by males relative to females, and a potential size-based increase in shark and mammal prey consumption, corroborating established ontogenetic increases in trophic level documented elsewhere for white sharks. Estimated nutritional intakes and niche breadths did not differ among sexes. Niche breadths were also similar between juvenile white sharks from Australia and South Africa. An increase in nutritional niche breadth with shark size was detected, associated with lipid consumption, which we suggest may relate to shifting nutritional goals linked with expanding migratory ranges.","[Grainger, Richard; Raubenheimeru, David; Machovsky-Capuska, Gabriel E.] Univ Sydney, Charles Perkins Ctr, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Grainger, Richard; Raubenheimeru, David] Univ Sydney, Sch Life & Environm Sci, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Peddemors, Victor M.] Sydney Inst Marine Sci, New South Wales Dept Primary Ind Fisheries, Mosman, NSW, Australia","Grainger, R (corresponding author), Univ Sydney, Charles Perkins Ctr, Sydney, NSW, Australia.; Grainger, R (corresponding author), Univ Sydney, Sch Life & Environm Sci, Sydney, NSW, Australia.",richard.grainger@sydney.edu.au,,,New South Wales Department of Primary Industries through the New South Wales Shark Management Strategy (NSW SMS); NSW SMS/University of Sydney; Australian GovernmentAustralian Government,Project funding and support was provided by the New South Wales Department of Primary Industries through the New South Wales Shark Management Strategy (NSW SMS).

The proposed antenna is mainly composed of a feeding monopole, a grounded strip, a parasitic strip, and a parasitic patch. The lower band is covered by the quarter-wavelength resonant modes of the feeding monopole and grounded strip. The higher band is originally generated by the high order modes of the feeding monopole and grounded strip, and further widened by the quarter wavelength resonant modes of two parasitic structures. The utilization of some miniaturization techniques, such as parasitic radiating elements, loading substrate, and meandering radiating elements, enables the proposed antenna to achieve a compact structure. Therefore, the proposed antenna only occupies a compact volume of 29 mm x 15 mm x 57 mm. It is worth noting that the proposed antenna achieves two widebands without additional matching network.

Biotic and abiotic features vary among nursery areas, resulting in young sharks experiencing a range of physical and biological conditions that, in turn, influence life-history characteristics such as growth and mortality and are, therefore, directly related to population structure and ability to withstand fishing pressure. In the present study, we used tag and recapture data to estimate growth rates and construct size at age models for lemon sharks at Los Rogues, Venezuela. Annual growth rates of lemon sharks were comparable to those in other nursery areas, but considerably higher than those reported for the well studied nursery at Bimini, Bahamas. Growth rate increased with age during the first 4 years of life for lemon sharks at Los Rogues, while they occupied the nursery area. Comparison of growth rates of lemon sharks among geographically separate nursery areas showed no obvious relationships between growth rate and latitude or temperature. For species with broad geographical distributions, consideration of variability of life-history characteristics such as growth is important for accurate stock assessment and effective large-scale management of populations.","[Tavares, Rafael] Ctr Invest Tiburones CIT, Ave Don Bosco,Quinta ABC 10,Florid 1050, Caracas, Venezuela; [Wetherbee, Bradley M.] Univ Rhode Isl, Dept Biol Sci, Kingston, RI 02881 USA; [Wetherbee, Bradley M.] Nova Southeastern Univ, Guy Harvey Res Inst, Dania, FL 33064 USA; [Rodriguez, Jon Paul] Inst Venezolano Invest Cient IVIC, Ave Panamer Kilometro 11, San Antonio De Los Altos 1204, Estado Miranda, Venezuela","Wetherbee, BM (corresponding author), Univ Rhode Isl, Dept Biol Sci, Kingston, RI 02881 USA.; Wetherbee, BM (corresponding author), Nova Southeastern Univ, Guy Harvey Res Inst, Dania, FL 33064 USA.",wetherbee@uri.edu,,"Tavares, Rafael/0000-0003-4185-1357","USDA National Institute of Food and AgricultureUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA) [1017848, RI0019-H020]","This study is dedicated to the late Samuel `Sonny' Gruber, who pioneered research on lemon sharks.

The Nauta method, developed in a novel Army think tank at the Walter Reed Army Medical Center, was the next major breakthrough before neuroscience emerged as a separate discipline. Dr. Walle Nauta's (1916-1994) method allowed for the first time the ability to trace interneuronal connections accurately to their termination. The think tank, created by Dr. David Rioch (1900-1985), provided a unique intellectual environment for interdisciplinary neuroscience research, the first of its kind. Rioch hired exceptional senior faculty and recruited outstanding young investigators who were drafted into the Army, typically after finishing their M.D.s or Ph.D.s, and were interested in brain research. Many of these young investigators went on to illustrious careers in neuroscience. I worked with Walle Nauta at a time when the technique was first being applied to nonmammalian vertebrate brains. Along with other Army draftees, I was encouraged to pursue my own research interests. This led me on a quest to understand interspecific variability of connections in relation to evolution and ontogeny of the brain. By 1980, I had found that the variability of all known connections could be explained by a theory to the effect that new structures such as the neocortex were not formed by one system invading another and mingling, as Clarence Luther Herrick (1858-1904) had proposed, but by selective proliferation and differentiation sometimes involving the select loss of connections to reduce cross-modality interference as in the case of the parcellation and differentiation of cortical areas. The resulting parcellation theory predicts that elements of a primordial neocortex existed from the beginning of vertebrate evolution and did not originate by an invasion of nonolfactory modalities into the olfactory lobe, as commonly believed before the introduction of the Nauta method. This theory would not have been created if it were not for the brilliant environment that was Walter Reed in the 1960s.","[Ebbesson, Sven O.

And biologically inspired design has been studied in mechanical engineering using biological functions and principles as source domains. However, there were few studies regarding shape-based biological design in industrial design; furthermore, the openness of the source and target domains was vague. This study tries to explore shape-based biological design with closed source domain and closed target domain. In addition, this study aims to figure out students' difficulties and defects in bionics design to promote design education. Third-year undergraduate students, graduate students, and experts whose backgrounds are industrial design were invited to be participants in the study. Participants of each expertise level were divided into two groups and were given whole and segmented pictures of white sharks individually to design electric cars. Outcome-based validation was chosen to measure the effect of analogy. Multivariate ANOVA was used to evaluate the effect of expertise level and source domain completeness on the results. The findings showed that presenting designers with segmented pictures can increase the number of biological elements and details in the solution. However, there appeared to be no significant difference between the novelty of the work, whether the group received complete or segmented images. Novice designers were more innovative and preferred to use more biological elements during ideation than the experts, while the latter tended to use fewer elements of biology and generated solutions with a higher level of abstraction. For design education, the findings will give teachers advice on how to train and inspire their students in bionics design. For the design industry, segmented biological images can increase the elements used and the details in the sketches. In addition, the evaluation metrics for shape-based BID established in this study can help designers and manufacturers in terms of production.","[Luo, Shijian; Bian, Ze; Hu, Yuqi] Zhejiang Univ, Coll Comp Sci & Technol, Dept Ind Design, Hangzhou 310027, Peoples R China","Bian, Z (corresponding author), Zhejiang Univ, Coll Comp Sci & Technol, Dept Ind Design, Hangzhou 310027, Peoples R China.",sjluo@zju.edu.cn; 11421074@zju.edu.cn; 21621024@zju.edu.cn,,,National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [51675476],This work is supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (No.51675476).,,47,0,0,6,6,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0957-7572,1573-1804,,INT J TECHNOL DES ED,Int.

This study aimed to resolve the current lack of information on the movements and habitat use of white sharks, Carcharodon carcharias, between shelf, slope and oceanic areas located off southwestern Australia. Movement behaviours, spatial distribution patterns and vertical habitat use of juvenile, sub-adult and adult white sharks ranging in size from 1.9 to 5.7 m total length were examined using 43 satellite tags deployed over 15 years. Pop-up satellite archival tags and satellite-linked radio tags collected 3663 days and > 109,900 km of tracking data over periods of up to 381 days. We demonstrated sex-based differences in movement and distribution patterns of male (21) and female (19) white sharks. Female dispersal was broader and extended further offshore than males, which largely remained in neritic and gulf habitats. Female white sharks experienced a narrower range of water temperatures (F = 9.0-19.0 degrees C; M = 10.4-24.8 degrees C). Despite these subtle differences, both sexes showed an affinity to the Neptune Island Group and the shelf slope canyons of the eastern Great Australian Bight, which are productive and oceanographically complex regions that support known prey of white sharks. This study highlighted that the southern-western Australian population of white sharks use off-shelf habitat to a greater extent than previously identified. Findings have potential implications for: ecological risk assessments of fisheries that operate in these offshore habitats and for monitoring and managing marine protected areas.","[Bradford, Russell; Patterson, T.

Strong interference competition can drive habitat separation, but less is known of the role of interference if agonistic interactions are weak. While most theoretical models assume interference abilities to be constant in an environment, few consider that the extent of interference can vary by habitat and change model predictions. Using baited underwater cameras, we show a consistent dominance status between two sympatric reef sharks at an uninhabited Pacific atoll. Blacktip reef shark (Carcharhinus melanopterus) and gray reef shark (Carcharhinus amblyrhyncos) relative abundance showed an inverse relationship to each other but the strength of this relationship varied by habitat. Reef shark relative abundance declined more rapidly in the presence of heterospecifics on forereef habitats as opposed to backreefs. In all habitats, gray reef sharks were more likely to bite bait cages than blacktips when both species were present, and appeared to be the dominant species. Intraspecific interactions were also apparent, with individual willingness to bite bait decreasing as the number of conspecifics increased. Gray reef sharks may exert differential control over blacktip foraging success in different habitats. Habitat-specific behavioral interactions may partially explain patterns of spatial separation between competing species where interference is weak.","[Sabando, Maria A.; Papastamatiou, Yannis P.] Florida Int Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Miami, FL 33199 USA; [Rieucau, Guillaume] Louisiana Univ Marine Consortium, Chauvin, LA 70344 USA; [Bradley, Darcy] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Bren Sch Environm Sci, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Caselle, Jennifer E.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Marine Sci Inst, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA","Papastamatiou, YP (corresponding author), Florida Int Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Miami, FL 33199 USA.",ypapastamatiou@gmail.com,,"Bradley, Darcy/0000-0003-2581-8768",USFWSUS Fish & Wildlife Service; TNC,"We thank K.

The present study investigated the short-term effects of tourist presence on the behaviour of spinner dolphins at Sha'ab Samadai (Samadai Reef), in the southern Egyptian Red Sea. The reef has a large central lagoon where a population of spinner dolphin regularly rest from mid-morning to mid-afternoon; visitors are permitted to snorkel in the southern part of the lagoon, but not in the northern closed zone that the dolphins mainly use. Dolphin behaviour was monitored both on days when tourist boats were present and on days when they were absent. In the presence of tourists the proportion of time that the dolphins spent resting was reduced by two-thirds, whereas the times spent milling, travelling, and showing avoidance behaviour all increased. Furthermore, upon using Markov chain modelling to investigate the effect of tourist presence on the transition probabilities between dolphin activity states, significant changes were found in 10 of the 25 possible behavioural transitions, including increased probabilities of transitioning from resting to milling or travelling, from milling to travelling or avoiding, and from travelling to avoiding. These findings raise concerns that despite the management measures in place, tourist activities affect the dolphins' behaviour to a greater extent than was previously apparent, with potential long-term negative effects on their energy budget. The study led to proposals for amending the zoning of the site and for strengthening the regulations for tourist vessels.","[Shawky, Ahmed M.] Minister Environm, Tech Off, Cairo, Egypt; [Christiansen, Fredrik] Aarhus Inst Adv Studies, Hoegh Guldbergs Gade 6B, Aarhus, Denmark; [Christiansen, Fredrik] Aarhus Univ, Dept Biol, Zoophysiol, Aarhus, Denmark; [Christiansen, Fredrik] Murdoch Univ, Harry Butler Inst, Ctr Sustainable Aquat Ecosyst, Murdoch, WA, Australia; [Ormond, Rupert] Marine Conservat Int, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland; [Ormond, Rupert] Heriot Watt Univ, Ctr Marine Biodivers & Biotechnol, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland; [Ormond, Rupert] King Abdulaziz Univ, Fac Marine Sci, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia","Ormond, R (corresponding author), Marine Conservat Int, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland.",rupert.ormond.mci@gmail.com,,"Ormond, Rupert/0000-0003-4943-2843",HRH Prince Khaled bin Sultan,"The project was approved by official letter from the Marsa Alam office of the Red Sea Protectorates Division of the Egyptian Environmental Affairs Agency (EEAA), whom we also thank for logistical support, including the use of the patrol boat and other field gear.

Here we review the demise and the historical ecology of an iconic species, the critically endangered Angelshark Squatina squatina in the southern North Sea, using historical books and catch records of 104 individuals brought to the Dutch fish markets. These sources reveal that between 1600 and 1950, Angelsharks were annual visitors to the North Sea, and in some years were fairly commonly observed. The number of recorded individuals peaked in the early twentieth century and between 1945 and 1955, and declined rapidly in the 1960s, with the last recorded observation in 1973. The decline coincides with the introduction of engine-powered fisheries, whereas the full extirpation followed the increased use of diesel-powered beam-trawlers. The recorded observations of Angelsharks were most commonly from the summer season, in accordance with the prevailing notion of Angelsharks migrating to warmer waters in winter. Furthermore, most recorded catches were of newborns and adult females in shallow waters, showcasing the importance of the area for parturition and nursery. Our review exemplifies how a large predator disappeared from a marine food web and shows the importance of historical data to deduce the natural richness of the North Sea.","[Bom, Roeland A.; Camphuysen, Kees C.

A critical factor in determining the lifetime and transport of INPs is their size; however very little size-resolved atmospheric INP concentration information exists. Here we present the development and application of a radio-controlled payload capable of collecting size-resolved aerosol from a tethered balloon for the primary purpose of offline INP analysis. This payload, known as the SHARK (Selective Height Aerosol Research Kit), consists of two complementary cascade impactors for aerosol size-segregation from 0.25 to 10 mu m, with an after-filter and top stage to collect particles below and above this range at flow rates of up to 100 L min(-1). The SHARK also contains an optical particle counter to quantify aerosol size distribution between 0.38 and 10 mu m, and a radiosonde for the measurement of temperature, pressure, GPS altitude, and relative humidity. This is all housed within a weatherproof box, can be run from batteries for up to 11 h, and has a total weight of 9 kg. The radio control and live data link with the radiosonde allow the user to start and stop sampling depending on meteorological conditions and height, which can, for example, allow the user to avoid sampling in very humid or cloudy air, even when the SHARK is out of sight. While the collected aerosol could, in principle, be studied with an array of analytical techniques, this study demonstrates that the collected aerosol can be analysed with an offline droplet freezing instrument to determine size-resolved INP concentrations, activated fractions, and active site densities, producing similar results to those obtained using a standard PM10 aerosol sampler when summed over the appropriate size range. Test data, where the SHARK was sampling near ground level or suspended from a tethered balloon at 20m altitude, are presented from four contrasting locations having very different size-resolved INP spectra: Hyytiala (southern Finland), Leeds (northern England), Longyearbyen (Svalbard), and Cardington (southern England).","[Porter, Grace C.

Nevertheless, the taxonomic diversity of the Marine Molasse sharks, rays and skates is still largely unknown. Here, we describe 37 taxa from the lower Miocene of the Molasse Basin: 21 taxa could be identified at species level, whereas 15 taxa could only be assigned to genus and one taxon is left as order incertae sedis. The material was collected from deposits of the Auwiesholz Member of the Achen Formation (middle Burdigalian, middle Ottnangian age, ca. 17.8 Ma) exposed near Simssee, Upper Bavaria. This faunal assemblage is a mixture of shallow marine, near-coastal, pelagic and deep-water taxa. The fauna from Simssee displays different biogeographic dynamics at local and regional scales, possibly related to the intense climatic, oceanographic and tectonic events that occurred during the Eggenburgian-Ottnangian stages. The faunal relationships of the early Miocene chondrichthyan faunas from the Mediterranean Sea and Paratethys with others regions are established on the basis of qualitative (presence/absence) data. The beta diversity (Sorensen-Dice coefficient) of the Miocene Molasse elasmobranchs was used to characterize the taxonomic differentiation between localities and regions. According to our results, the fauna from Simssee shows close similarities with those from Switzerland, Austria, France and northern Germany. Faunal similarities and differences are mainly related to tectonic events and oceanographic variables (i.e. migration through seaway passages) or might represent collecting biases.","[Villafana, Jaime A.; Marrama, Giuseppe; Kriwet, Juergen] Univ Vienna, Dept Palaeontol, Althanstr 14, A-1090 Vienna, Austria; [Villafana, Jaime A.] Univ Bernardo OHiggins, Ctr Invest Recursos Nat & Sustentabilidad, Santiago, Chile; [Klug, Stefanie] Georg August Univ, Sch Sci GAUSS, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany; [Pollerspoeck, Juergen] Bavarian State Collect Zool, Munich, Germany; [Balsberger, Markus] Achberg 11, D-83259 Schleching, Germany; [Rivadeneira, Marcelo] Ctr Estudios Avanzados Zonas Aridas, Av Ossandon 877, Coquimbo, Chile; [Rivadeneira, Marcelo] Univ Catolica Norte, Fac Ciencias Mar, Dept Biol Marina, Coquimbo, Chile; [Rivadeneira, Marcelo] Univ La Serena, Dept Biol, La Serena, Chile; [Marrama, Giuseppe] Univ Torino, Dipartimento Sci Terra, Via Valperga Caluso 35, I-10125 Turin, Italy","Villafana, JA (corresponding author), Univ Vienna, Dept Palaeontol, Althanstr 14, A-1090 Vienna, Austria.; Villafana, JA (corresponding author), Univ Bernardo OHiggins, Ctr Invest Recursos Nat & Sustentabilidad, Santiago, Chile.",villafanaj88@univie.ac.at; giuseppe.marrama@unito.it; stefanie.klug@gauss.uni-goettingen.de; juergen.pollerspoeck@shark-references.com; mbalsberger@gmx.de; marcelo.rivadeneira@ceza.cl; juergen.kriwet@univie.ac.at,"Pollerspock, Jurgen/K-5499-2015; Klug, Stefanie/T-2328-2018","Pollerspock, Jurgen/0000-0001-5558-0987; Villafana, Jaime/0000-0002-6441-9025; Rivadeneira, Marcelo/0000-0002-1681-416X; Kriwet, Jurgen/0000-0002-6439-8455; Klug, Stefanie/0000-0001-9437-7236","Becas de Doctorado en el Extranjero, Becas Chile [72160271]","This research was supported by Becas de Doctorado en el Extranjero, Becas Chile (Grant 72160271).",,193,0,0,1,1,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0031-0220,1867-6812,,PALZ,PalZ,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1007/s12542-020-00518-7,,Jun-20,33,Paleontology,Paleontology,LT8RK,WOS:000537335000001,,Other Gold,,,9/10/20

Predicted climate-change impacts threaten the stability of this setting and the balance of biogeomorphological processes that generate them. In this setting, long-term surficial CO2 sequestration occurs through the combination of biomineralisation, organomineralisation and lithification, which locks atmospheric CO2 into CaCO3 rocks and sediments. Biogeomorphological processes that control the distribution and effectiveness of these mechanisms including biostabilisation, bioconstruction, bioerosion and bioturbation have not been addressed in this setting to date. A three-dimensional biogemorphological mapping unit framework is defined at three locations in Hamelin Pool within the shallow-subtidal to supratidal zones based on historical and recent multiscale datasets. This framework is used to review the complex distribution of geomorphological and biogeomorphological processes. The distribution of lithification within a biogeomorphological process context is examined, and current geological analogue models of microbialite and coquina development are expanded to include biogeomorphological processes. The framework is used to understand the impacts of increased water elevation in response to intensification of the Leeuwin Current during the 2010-2012 Ningaloo Nino event. Potential climate change impacts are identified including reduced intertidal bioconstruction, and a shift from microbialitic structure generation to increased grain generation reducing stromatolite development. Review of the uncertainty of impacts of ocean acidification and temperature shifts on biomineralisation, organomineralisation and lithification processes, crucial to the maintenance of the outstanding universal values in this World Heritage location, suggests urgent research is required.","[Morris, Therese E.; Collins, Lindsay B.] Curtin Univ, Appl Geol, Perth, WA, Australia; [Visscher, Pieter T.] Univ Connecticut, Dept Marine Sci, Storrs, CT USA; [O'Leary, Micheal J.] Univ Western Australia, Sch Earth Sci, Perth, WA, Australia; [Fearns, Peter R.

It found that four critical groups that have a significant role in the development of Indonesian BMTs: ICMI (Association of Indonesian Muslim Intellectual), Islamic mass organizations, NGOs, and local governments. The issues of loan sharks and poverty alleviation were the primary factors driving the inception of BMTs. Despite women being crucial clients, none of the studied BMTs explicitly invoked women's empowerment in their organizational vision. To conclude, the BMTs' preference for women is not based on an understanding of gender inequality, but rather motivated by pragmatic business considerations, particularly the self-sustainability paradigm that underpins their practices.","[Rahayu, Ninik Sri] Islamic Univ Indonesia, Dept Finance & Banking, Yogyakarta 55283, Indonesia","Rahayu, NS (corresponding author), Islamic Univ Indonesia, Dept Finance & Banking, Yogyakarta 55283, Indonesia.",ninik.srirahayu2013@gmail.com,,,Indonesia Endowment Fund for Education (LPDP) [20151122094780],I would like to acknowledge the financial support provided by Indonesia Endowment Fund for Education (LPDP) (Project No. 20151122094780).,,50,0,0,0,0,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",2227-7072,,,INT J FINANC STUD,Int.

Current therapies suppress HBV but viral rebound occurs on cessation of therapy; novel therapeutic strategies are urgently required. To develop a therapeutic HBV vaccine that can induce high magnitude T cells to all major HBV antigens, we have developed a novel HBV vaccine using chimpanzee adenovirus (ChAd) and modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA) viral vectors encoding multiple HBV antigens. ChAd vaccine alone generated very high magnitude HBV specific T cell responses to all HBV major antigens. The inclusion of a shark Invariant (SIi) chain genetic adjuvant significantly enhanced the magnitude of T-cells against HBV antigens. Compared to ChAd alone vaccination, ChAd-prime followed by MVA-boost vaccination further enhanced the magnitude and breadth of the vaccine induced T cell response. Intra-cellular cytokine staining study showed that HBV specific CD8+ and CD4+ T cells were polyfunctional, producing combinations of IFN gamma, TNF-alpha, and IL-2. In summary, we have generated genetically adjuvanted ChAd and MVA vectored HBV vaccines with the potential to induce high-magnitude T cell responses through a prime-boost therapeutic vaccination approach. These pre-clinical studies pave the way for new studies of HBV therapeutic vaccination in humans with chronic hepatitis B infection.","[Chinnakannan, Senthil K.; Cargill, Tamsin N.; Donnison, Timothy A.; Lee, Lian Ni; Hutchings, Claire; Klenerman, Paul; Barnes, Eleanor] Univ Oxford, Nuffield Dept Med, Peter Medawar Bldg, Oxford OX1 3SY, England; [Ansari, M.

However, few studies of ecosystem structure in the tropical Pacific Ocean have been carried out. In this study, we analyzed the food web structure in the central and eastern tropical Pacific Ocean based on trophic relationships of 35 pelagic species collected by Chinese tuna longline observers from June to November in 2017. Topology indices (node degree, D; centrality indices,BCandCC; topological importance indices,TI1,TI3; keystone indices,K, K(t)andK(b)) and Key-Player algorithms (KPP-1, KPP-2) were used to select key species and construct a simplified food web combined with body size data. The Kendall rank correlation and hierarchical clustering analysis indicated that different topology indices resulted in consistent rankings of key species. Most key species were the same as those selected in other studies in the Pacific Ocean, such as Shortbill spearfish (Tetrapturus angustirostris), Swordfish (Xiphias gladius), Albacore tuna (Thunnus alalunga), cephalopods and scomber. The food web would be separated into many unconnected parts (F=0.632,F-D=0.795,R-D=0.957) after the removal of the five key species, indicating the key roles of these species in the food web structure and stability. Body size was considered an influential indicator in constructing the simplified food web.

We demonstrate human-friendly, simple, stretchable, fast, durable, and programmable centimeter-scale SEMAs that drive a soft shark, interact with everyday objects, or rapidly mix a dye with water. A multicoil flower SEMA with individually controlled petals blooms or closes within tens of milliseconds, and a cubic SEMA performs programmed, arbitrary motion sequences. We develop a numerical model supporting design and opening potential routes toward miniaturization, reduction of power consumption, and increase in mechanical efficiency. SEMAs are electrically controlled shape-morphing systems that are potentially empowering future applications from soft grippers to minimally invasive medicine.","[Mao, Guoyong; Drack, Michael; Karami-Mosammam, Mahya; Wirthl, Daniela; Stockinger, Thomas; Schwoediauer, Reinhard; Kaltenbrunner, Martin] Johannes Kepler Univ Linz, Inst Expt Phys, Div Soft Matter Phys, Altenberger Str 69, A-4040 Linz, Austria; [Mao, Guoyong; Drack, Michael; Karami-Mosammam, Mahya; Wirthl, Daniela; Stockinger, Thomas; Schwoediauer, Reinhard; Kaltenbrunner, Martin] Johannes Kepler Univ Linz, Linz Inst Technol, Soft Mat Lab, Altenberger Str 69, A-4040 Linz, Austria","Mao, GY; Kaltenbrunner, M (corresponding author), Johannes Kepler Univ Linz, Inst Expt Phys, Div Soft Matter Phys, Altenberger Str 69, A-4040 Linz, Austria.; Mao, GY; Kaltenbrunner, M (corresponding author), Johannes Kepler Univ Linz, Linz Inst Technol, Soft Mat Lab, Altenberger Str 69, A-4040 Linz, Austria.",guoyong.mao@jku.at; martin.kaltenbrunner@jku.at,"Mao, Guoyong/F-1095-2015","Mao, Guoyong/0000-0002-7570-6206; Kaltenbrunner, Martin/0000-0002-7247-9183",ERC Starting Grant GEL-SYS [757931]; LIT (Linz Institute of Technology) Soft Electronics Laboratory [LIT013144001SEL],This work was supported by the ERC Starting Grant GEL-SYSunder grant agreement no. 757931 and a startup funding of the LIT (Linz Institute of Technology) Soft Electronics Laboratory under grant no.

How this largest fish thrives in tropical environments that promote high metabolism but support less robust zooplankton communities has not been sufficiently explained. We used open-source inertial measurement units (IMU) to log 397 h of whale shark behavior in Yucatan, Mexico, at a site of both active feeding and intense wildlife tourism. Here we show that the strategies employed by whale sharks to compensate for the increased drag of an open mouth are similar to ram feeders five orders of magnitude smaller and one order of magnitude larger. Presumed feeding constituted 20% of the total time budget of four sharks, with individual feeding bouts lasting up to 11 consecutive hours. Compared with normal, sub-surface swimming, three sharks increased their stroke rate and amplitude while surface feeding, while one shark that fed at depth did not demonstrate a greatly increased energetic cost. Additionally, based on time-depth budgets, we estimate that aerial surveys of shark populations should consider including a correction factor of 3 to account for the proportion of daylight hours that sharks are not visible at the surface. With foraging bouts generally lasting several hours, interruptions to foraging during critical feeding periods may represent substantial energetic costs to these endangered species, and this study presents baseline data from which management decisions affecting tourist interactions with whale sharks may be made.","[Cade, David E.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Inst Marine Sci, 115 McAllister Way, Santa Cruz, CA 95060 USA; [Cade, David E.] Stanford Univ, Hopkins Marine Stn, 120 Ocean View Blvd, Pacific Grove, CA 93950 USA; [Levenson, J.

The goal of this study was to investigate the stability of body temperature in large fish using data from field experiments. We measured the muscle temperatures of free-ranging whale sharks (Rhincodon typus), the largest extant fish globally, and investigated their ectothermic physiology and the stability of their body temperature. The muscle temperature changed substantially more slowly than the water temperature fluctuations associated with vertical movements, and the whole-body heat-transfer coefficients (HTCs) of whale sharks estimated using heat-budget models were lower than those of any other fish species measured to date. The heat-budget models also showed that internal heat production does not contribute to changes in muscle temperature. A comparative analysis showed that the HTC at cooling in various fish species including both ectothermic and endothermic species ranging from 10(-4) to 10(3) kg was proportional to body mass(-0.63). This allometry was present regardless of whether the fish were ectothermic or endothermic, and was an extension of the relationship observed in previous studies on small fish. Thus, large fish have the advantage of body temperature stability while moving in environments with large temperature variations. Our results suggest that the large body size of whale sharks aids in preventing a decrease in body temperature during deep excursions to more than 1000 m depths without high metabolic costs of producing heat.","[Nakamura, Itsumi] Nagasaki Univ, Org Marine Sci & Technol, 1551-7 Tairamachi, Nagasaki 8512213, Japan; [Matsumoto, Rui] Okinawa Churaumi Aquarium, 888 Ishikawa, Motobu, Okinawa 9050206, Japan; [Sato, Katsufumi] Univ Tokyo, Atmosphere & Ocean Res Inst, 5-1-5 Kashiwanoha, Kashiwa, Chiba 2778564, Japan","Nakamura, I (corresponding author), Nagasaki Univ, Org Marine Sci & Technol, 1551-7 Tairamachi, Nagasaki 8512213, Japan.",itsumi@nagasaki-u.ac.jp,,"Nakamura, Itsumi/0000-0002-1386-7266","Bio-Logging Science; University of Tokyo (UTBLS); Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS)Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [16J00837, 17H00776]; CREST funding program from the Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST) [JPMJCR13A5]","This study was funded by the Bio-Logging Science, the University of Tokyo (UTBLS), Grant-in-Aids for JSPS Fellows from the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) (16J00837, 17H00776), and the CREST funding program from the Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST) (JPMJCR13A5).",,62,1,1,10,10,COMPANY BIOLOGISTS LTD,CAMBRIDGE,"BIDDER BUILDING, STATION RD, HISTON, CAMBRIDGE CB24 9LF, ENGLAND",0022-0949,1477-9145,,J EXP BIOL,J.

The objective of this study was to determine baseline gastric emptying and GI transit times in cownose rays (Rhinoptera bonasus) and whitespotted bamboo sharks (Chiloscyllium plagiosum) via radiographic barium sulfate contrast studies. Additionally, a pilot study was undertaken to determine the effect of metoclopramide on GI transit time in whitespotted bamboo sharks. Eight cownose rays and eight whitespotted bamboo sharks were administered a 98% w/w barium sulfate suspension at 8 ml/kg via orogastric tube. Post-contrast radiographs were obtained at 2 min, 3, 6, 12, and 23 hr for rays; and 2 min, 3, 6, 9, 12, 16, 25, 30, 36, and every 12 hr until complete gastric emptying occurred for sharks. In cownose rays, the mean and standard error were established for time of initial spiral colon filling (3.4 +/- 0.4 hr), complete spiral colon opacification (12 +/- 0 hr), initial spiral colon emptying (21.6 +/- 1.4 hr), and complete gastric emptying (23 +/- 0 hr). In bamboo sharks, the mean and standard error were established for time of initial spiral colon filling (5.3 +/- 0.5 hr), complete spiral colon opacification (12.4 +/- 1.3 hr), initial spiral colon emptying (22.5 +/- 2.7 hr), and complete gastric emptying (39.9 +/- 3.3 hr). Cownose rays had a significantly shorter time to spiral colon filling and complete gastric emptying compared with bamboo sharks (P < 0.05). Whitespotted bamboo sharks (n = 8) were administered metoclopramide (0.4 mg/kg orally once daily for 10 days) and the barium series was repeated. Complete gastric emptying time was significantly shorter in treated sharks compared with control (P < 0.05), suggesting that metoclopramide may be a useful therapeutic for GI motility disorders in elasmobranchs.","[Joblon, Melissa J.; Flower, Jennifer E.; Tuttle, Allison D.] Mystic Aquarium, Dept Anim Care, 55 Coogan Blvd, Mystic, CT 06355 USA; [Thompson, Laura A.] Mystic Aquarium, Dept Res, 55 Coogan Blvd, Mystic, CT 06355 USA; [Bray, Rebecca L.] Mystic Aquarium, Invertebrates Dept, 55 Coogan Blvd, Mystic, CT 06355 USA; [Joblon, Melissa J.] New England Aquarium, Anim Hlth Dept, 1 Cent Wharf, Boston, MA 02110 USA","Flower, JE (corresponding author), Mystic Aquarium, Dept Anim Care, 55 Coogan Blvd, Mystic, CT 06355 USA.",jflower@mysticaquarium.org,,,,,,27,0,0,0,0,AMER ASSOC ZOO VETERINARIANS,YULEE,"581705 WHITE OAK ROAD, YULEE, FL 32097 USA",1042-7260,1937-2825,,J ZOO WILDLIFE MED,J.

In the present study, for the first time, the in situ mineralization (ideally hydroxyapatite formation) of blue shark (Prionace glauca (PG)) collagen to fabricate 3D printable cell-laden hydrogels is proposed. In the first part, several parameters for collagen mineralization were tested until optimization. The hydroxyapatite formation was confirmed by FT-IR, XRD, and TEM techniques. In the second part, stable bioinks combining the biomimetically mineralized collagen with alginate (AG) (1:1, 1:2, 1:3, and AG) solution were used for 3D printing of hydrogels. The addition of Ca2+ ions into the system did present a synergistic effect: by one side, the in situ mineralization of the collagen occurred, and at same time, they were also useful to ionically cross-link the blends with alginate, avoiding the addition of any cytotoxic chemical cross-linking agent. Mouse fibroblast cell line survival during and after printing was favored by the presence of PG collagen as exhibited by the biological performance of the hydrogels. Inspired in a concept of marine byproduct valorization, 3D bioprinting of in situ mineralized blue shark collagen is thus proposed as a promising approach, envisioning the engineering of mineralized tissues.","[Diogo, Gabriela S.; Marques, Catarina F.; Pirraco, Rogerio P.; Reis, Rui L.; Silva, Tiago H.] Univ Minho, I3Bs Res Inst Biomat Biodegradables & Biomimet, 3Bs Res Grp, Headquarters European Inst Excellence Tissue Engn, P-4805017 Guimaraes, Portugal; [Diogo, Gabriela S.; Marques, Catarina F.; Pirraco, Rogerio P.; Reis, Rui L.; Silva, Tiago H.] ICVS 3Bs PT Govt Associate Lab, Braga, Portugal; [Sotelo, Carmen G.; Perez-Martin, Ricardo, I] Inst Invest Marinas CSIC, Vigo 36208, Spain; [Reis, Rui L.] Headquarters Univ Minho, Discoveries Ctr Regenerat & Precis Med, P-4805017 Guimaraes, Portugal","Silva, TH (corresponding author), Univ Minho, I3Bs Res Inst Biomat Biodegradables & Biomimet, 3Bs Res Grp, Headquarters European Inst Excellence Tissue Engn, P-4805017 Guimaraes, Portugal.; Silva, TH (corresponding author), ICVS 3Bs PT Govt Associate Lab, Braga, Portugal.",tiago.silva@i3bs.uminho.pt,"Pirraco, Rogerio P/O-8122-2015; da Silva, Tiago Henriques/P-6902-2019","Pirraco, Rogerio P/0000-0001-5521-950X; da Silva, Tiago Henriques/0000-0001-8520-603X","Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology (FCT)Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology [M-ERA-NET2/0022/2016]; European UnionEuropean Union (EU) [ERC-2012-ADG 20120216-321266]; INTERREG Atlantic Area Programme under project BlueHuman [EAPA_151/2016]; Norte Portugal Regional Operational Programme (NORTE 2020), under the PORTUGAL 2020 Partnership Agreement [NORTE-08-5369-FSE-000044, NORTE-01-0145-FEDER-000021, NORTE-01-0145-FEDER-000023]; European Social FundEuropean Social Fund (ESF); FCTPortuguese Foundation for Science and Technology [IF/00347/2015]","This study was funded by the Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology (FCT) under the scope of the BiogenInk project (M-ERA-NET2/0022/2016), by the European Union Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013) through grant agreement n.

The constant imposed temperature gradient may be aligned with gravity in either the same or opposite direction. In the dimensionless parameter space, deformation becomes important at a smaller drop size ratio when the temperature gradient and gravity are aligned in the same direction, because the driving force is larger and induces dimple formation earlier. For the same reason, in a physical system of ethyl salicylate (ES) drops in an unbounded matrix of diethylene glycol (DEG), deformation becomes important for smaller drops when the driving forces have a parallel, rather than anti-parallel, arrangement. In developing the population dynamics for slightly deformable drops, a new, simplified expression for the collision efficiency for spherical drops in the absence of van der Waals forces is presented, which successfully separates the contributions of the two driving forces. Two collision-forbidden regions can occur for opposed driving forces leading to a shark-fin shaped collision efficiency curve for two slightly deformable drops. As shown in population dynamics, if the drop distribution is broad enough, it is possible for drops to jump the first collision-forbidden region.","[Stark, John K.; Rother, Michael A.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Chem Engn, Duluth, MN 55812 USA; [Stark, John K.] Univ Illinois, Dept Chem Engn, Chicago, IL 60607 USA","Rother, MA (corresponding author), Univ Minnesota, Dept Chem Engn, Duluth, MN 55812 USA.",mrother@d.umn.edu,,,,,,40,0,0,2,2,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0938-0108,1875-0494,,MICROGRAVITY SCI TEC,Microgravity Sci.

Nevertheless, very little information is known about their ecology, behaviour, and taxonomy in the Mediterranean, and especially in the Levant, where water temperature, salinity, and the impact of invasive species are relatively high. Although it has been suggested that some species may aggregate in the Levant, this has not been formally documented and the scale of this phenomenon, the taxonomic composition, and the temporal dynamics are unknown. Visual surveys were conducted, which allowed the documentation of stingrays and guitarfish behaviour, and which was not available from data based on fishery catches. The census took place within a marine protected area over a period of 3 years. Altogether, we documented 675 batoid observations. One of the observed species is Endangered (Glaucostegus cemiculus) and one is Vulnerable (Dasyatis pastinaca), whereas the others are classed as Least Concern (Torpedo torpedoandTorpedo marmorata), Data Deficient (Taeniurops grabatus), non-assessed within the Mediterranean (Dasyatis chrysonota), and Not Evaluated (Himantura uarnak). Results show clear seasonal patterns, with dense aggregations recorded during spring and early summer, when densities reached 85 observations per kilometre. In addition, there were clear indications of breeding behaviour inD. pastinacaandD. chrysonota, including the first recorded documentation ofD. pastinacacourtship in the Mediterranean. Large seasonal stingrays and guitarfish aggregations in shallow waters have not, to our knowledge, been documented in the Mediterranean Sea previously. This highlights the importance of conserving shallow habitats as potential breeding grounds. As these sites are easily reached while both snorkelling and diving, the aggregation of these charismatic species can serve as potential ecotourism sites. Finally, this study shows the benefits of using simple visual census, as opposed to catch-based methods, to record both the diversity and the behaviour of batoids.","[Chaikin, Shahar; Belmaker, Jonathan] Tel Aviv Univ, Fac Life Sci, Sch Zool, IL-6997801 Tel Aviv, Israel; [Chaikin, Shahar; Barash, Adi] NGO Conservat Sharks & Rays Israel & Mediterranea, Sharks Israel, Tel Aviv, Israel; [Belmaker, Jonathan] Tel Aviv Univ, Steinhardt Museum Nat Hist, Tel Aviv, Israel; [Barash, Adi] Univ Haifa, Sch Marine Sci, Haifa, Israel","Chaikin, S (corresponding author), Tel Aviv Univ, Fac Life Sci, Sch Zool, IL-6997801 Tel Aviv, Israel.",shahar710@gmail.com,,"Belmaker, Jonathan/0000-0002-5618-7359; Chaikin, Shahar/0000-0003-1352-9432",,,,47,0,0,5,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1052-7613,1099-0755,,AQUAT CONSERV,Aquat.

The usual J-hook No. 2 with 10 degrees offset, which has been traditionally used by the fishery, was compared to the 18/0 non-offset circle hook in an alternating fashion along the main line. In total, 22 experimental longline sets were deployed through the shark fishing seasons of 2016 and 2017 to examine the effects of hook types on the catch composition, the catch rates, the hooking location, and the status at haulback. The catch composition differed significantly among hook types. Moreover, an overall increase in catch rates for the main species, the sandbar sharkCarcharhinus plumbeus, and the shortfin mako sharkIsurus oxyrinchus, was observed when using circle hooks. There was no size-selective effect of circle hooks for the common species. The circle hooks were not effective at reducing at-haulback mortality of sandbar shark. Conversely, shortfin mako and smooth-hound sharkMustelus mustelusshowed significantly lower relative mortality at haulback with circle hooks than with J-hooks. Furthermore, circle hooks were more frequently hooked externally than the J-hooks for the three shark species. Results demonstrated that the use of 18/0 non-offset circle hooks in the pelagic shark longline fishery can reduce mortality at haulback for some species without any benefit for the dominant species, the sandbar shark. Overall, it is difficult to promote the adoption of the use of circle hooks as a management measure in this specialized fishery. Management measures focusing on fishing effort controls, fishing closures in critical habitats, and size limits could have significant benefits for the conservation of shark species and may help to improve the sustainability of the shark fishery in the Gulf of Gabes.","[Saidi, Bechir] Ahmed Zarroug, Fac Sci Gafsa, Gafsa, Tunisia; [Echwikhi, Khaled] Inst Super Biol Appl Medenine, Medenine, Tunisia; [Saidi, Bechir; Enajjar, Samira; Karaa, Sami; Bradai, Mohamed N.] Inst Natl Sci & Technol Mer, Ctr Sfax, Sfax, Tunisia; [Jribi, Imed] Fac Sci Sfax, Sfax, Tunisia","Saidi, B (corresponding author), Ahmed Zarroug, Fac Sci Gafsa, Gafsa, Tunisia.",bechirinstm@yahoo.fr,,,,,,51,0,0,4,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1052-7613,1099-0755,,AQUAT CONSERV,Aquat.

SerumEPHfractions have been determined for elasmobranchs using mammalian albumin, alpha 1-, alpha 2-, beta-, and gamma-globulin fractions, and have been deemed fractions 1 through 5, respectively. However, serumEPHfraction concentration reference intervals (RIs) have not been widely established for different elasmobranch species. In this study,RIs for fractions 1 through 5 were determined from 45 wild-caught Nurse SharksGinglymostoma cirratum(27 females and 23 males) in South Florida. Serum samples were isolated from whole blood following caudal venipuncture. Body condition was also measured in the field to assess the relative health of the individuals sampled. There was no relationship between body condition and serumEPHfraction concentrations. In addition, there was no difference in body condition or serumEPHfraction concentrations between females and males. Total solids and total protein values were significantly different (P < 0.001). Nurse Shark serumEPHfraction 1 was found within the mammalian albumin migrating band distance and was negligible. Fraction 2 showed no peak in the mammalian alpha 1-globulin range. A thin, medium peak in the mammalian alpha 2-globulin range represented fraction 3. In the mammalian beta-globulin range, fraction 4 consisted of the majority of protein observed. It was represented by a smooth, broad peak. A short, medium broad peak in the mammalian gamma-globulin range represented fraction 5. The Nurse Shark serumEPHfractionRIs provided in this study may be utilized to clinically evaluate the health of Nurse Sharks in captivity and in the wild, and to compare the health of their populations around the world experiencing various anthropogenic stressors and other environmental impacts.","[AtallahBenson, Leila; Hammerschlag, Neil] Univ Miami, Dept Marine Ecosyst & Soc, Rosenstiel Sch Atmospher Sci, 4600 Rickenbacker Causeway, Miami, FL 33149 USA; [AtallahBenson, Leila; Merly, Liza; Hammerschlag, Neil] Univ Miami, Shark Res & Conservat Program, 4600 Rickenbacker Causeway, Miami, FL 33149 USA; [AtallahBenson, Leila; Merly, Liza] Univ Miami, Dept Marine Biol & Ecol, Rosenstiel Sch Atmospher Sci, 4600 Rickenbacker Causeway, Miami, FL 33149 USA; [Cray, Carolyn] Univ Miami, Div Comparat Pathol, Dept Pathol & Lab Med, Miller Sch Med, POB 016960 R46, Miami, FL 33101 USA","AtallahBenson, L (corresponding author), Univ Miami, Dept Marine Ecosyst & Soc, Rosenstiel Sch Atmospher Sci, 4600 Rickenbacker Causeway, Miami, FL 33149 USA.",latallahbenson@gmail.com,,"AtallahBenson, Leila/0000-0002-9812-791X",,,,30,0,0,4,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0899-7659,1548-8667,,J AQUAT ANIM HEALTH,J.

Also referred to as niche specialization, such differences can be documented through direct or indirect observation of resource or habitat use. Here, we examined selective habitat use in alliance-forming male Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins, Tursiops aduncus, in Shark Bay, Western Australia. Using 6 years of sighting data (2001-2006), we calculated the home ranges of 17 male alliances (comprising 3-14 individuals each). We defined five habitat types in the study area and measured the proportion of each habitat type in the home range of each alliance. Habitat selectivity was examined using selection ratios of used and available habitat within alliance home ranges. Since home range is also a form of habitat selection, we also examined selection ratios of alliances within defined subareas within the study area. Subareas were the combined home ranges of subsets of alliances that were linked by general location, distinctive habitat features and seasonal movement patterns. During each sighting, the predominant group behaviour was recorded. We analysed data from all sightings (which included all behavioural types: resting, travelling, socializing and foraging), as well as a restricted set of foraging groups only. For all sightings, alliances were selective of habitat within each of three subareas (northern, central, southern), and 14 alliances were selective of habitat within their home range. For foraging sightings, alliances within all three subareas were selective with respect to foraging habitat, and seven alliances showed significant selection of foraging habitat within their respective home ranges. Some alliances with broadly overlapping ranges foraged in different habitats. Alliance-specific habitat use may be influenced by ecological and social factors. Our results raise the possibility that the considerable variation in alliance size within this population may be influenced by the distribution of food as well as the distribution of females.

Siliciclastic sediment is interpreted to have been delivered to the tidal flat by aeolian processes because of the narrow range in grain size and paucity of clay. Tidal influence is dominant as evidenced by reversing currents and desiccation on the tidal flat, and megaripples with reversing current indicators in offshore shoals. Intraclastic conglomerates were deposited in broad channels on the tidal flats during storm surges. Microbialite deposition is interpreted to be controlled by accommodation favouring amalgamated thin biostromes developed in the tidal flat vs. larger mounds with greater synoptic relief in the offshore, and current energy resulting in preferential elongation of offshore mounds in a NE-SW orientation. Intertidal mounds and biostromes grew in the presence of significant siliciclastic flux and trapped it within their structure, whereas offshore large buildups incorporated little siliciclastic component. Oolite and skeletal grainstone formed in tide agitated shoals associated with large subtidal microbial mounds. Storms extensively recycled and redistributed skeletal and oolitic sands from the offshore shoals across the shelf as thin sand sheets. Spatial mixing of siliciclastic and carbonate sediment occurred across the tidal flat and shelf. Low-frequency and intermediate-frequency stratigraphic cycles were driven by shifts in the shoreline and changes in rate of siliciclastic flux in response to relative sea-level fluctuation. Random facies stacking and the lack of metre-scale cyclicity are interpreted to reflect stratigraphic incompleteness and an episodic signal introduced by storms.","[Lehrmann, Daniel J.; Droxler, Dylan A.; Kelleher, Caroline; Lehrmann, Asmara A.; Lhemann, Adrien; Mabry, Grace; Mercado, Lauren; Yazbek, Lindsey] Trinity Univ, Geosci Dept, One Trinity Pl, San Antonio, TX 78212 USA; [Droxler, Andre W.; Hopson, Heath H.; Khanna, Pankaj; Proctor, Jacob M.; Singh, Pulkit] Rice Univ, Dept Earth Sci, Houston, TX USA; [Harris, Paul (Mitch)] Univ Miami, RSMAS, CSL Ctr Carbonate Res, Miami, FL USA; [Minzoni, Marcello] Univ Alabama, Dept Geol Sci, Tuscaloosa, AL USA","Lehrmann, DJ (corresponding author), Trinity Univ, Geosci Dept, One Trinity Pl, San Antonio, TX 78212 USA.",dlehrmann@trinity.edu,,"Harris, Paul/0000-0002-6908-9088; Khanna, Pankaj/0000-0001-7165-3082",Chevron; Conoco-Phillips; ShellRoyal Dutch Shell; Statoil; Rice Univerity [OTT-SRA-13-0182_Sub],"Chevron; Conoco-Phillips; Shell; Statoil; Rice Univerity Subcontract, Grant/Award Number: OTT-SRA-13-0182_Sub",,98,0,0,1,1,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2055-4877,,,DEPOS REC,Depos.

PROSPECT comes with two popular families of stellar population libraries (BC03 and EMILES), and a large variety of methods to construct star formation and metallicity histories. It models dust through the use of a Charlot & Fall attenuation model, with re-emission using Dale far-infrared templates. It also has the ability to model active galactic nucleus (AGN) through the inclusion of a simple AGN and hot torus model. Finally, it makes use of MAPPINGS-III photoionization tables to produce line emission features. We test the generative and inversion utility of PROSPECT through application to the SHARK galaxy formation semi-analytic code, and informed by these results produce fits to the final ultraviolet to far-infrared photometric catalogues produces by the Galaxy and Mass Assembly Survey. As part of the testing of PROSPECT, we also produce a range of simple photometric stellar mass approximations covering a range of filters for both observed frame and rest-frame photometry.","[Robotham, A.

MATERIALS/METHODS: Low-density lipoprotein receptor knockout (LDLR-KO) mice were fed HCD with an oral administration of CS (50 and 100 mg/kg BW/day), SCS (100 and 200 mg/kg BW/day), or water, respectively, for ten weeks. RESULTS: The administration of CS or SCS reduced the levels of serum triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), and LDL cholesterol and elevated the levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, compared with those of the control group (P < 0.05). Furthermore, CS or SCS significantly attenuated inflammation by reducing the serum levels of interleukin (IL)-1 beta and hepatic protein expression levels of nuclear factor kappa B, inducible nitric oxide synthase, cyclooxygenase-2, and IL-1beta (P < 0.05). In particular, the serum level of tumor necrosis factor-alpha was reduced only in the 100 mg/kg BW/day of SCS-fed group, whereas the IL-6 level was reduced in the 100 and 200 mg/kg BW/day of SCS-fed groups (P < 0.05). In addition, lipid peroxidation and nitric oxide production were attenuated in the livers of the CS and SCS groups mediated by the upregulation of hepatic proteins of antioxidant enzymes, such as superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase ( P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the biological effects of SCS, similar to those of CS, are attributed to improved lipid profiles as well as suppressed inflammation and oxidative stress induced by the intake of HCD.","[Seol, Bo Gyeong; Kim, Ji Hyun; Woo, Minji; Song, Yeong Ok; Cho, Eun Ju] Pusan Natl Univ, Dept Food Sci & Nutr, 2 Busandaehak Ro 63Beon Gil, Busan 46241, South Korea; [Seol, Bo Gyeong; Kim, Ji Hyun; Woo, Minji; Song, Yeong Ok; Cho, Eun Ju] Pusan Natl Univ, Kimchi Res Inst, 2 Busandaehak Ro 63Beon Gil, Busan 46241, South Korea; [Woo, Minji] Busan Innovat Inst Ind Sci & Technol Planning BIS, Busan 48058, South Korea; [Choi, Yung Hyun] Dong Eui Univ, Antiaging Res Ctr, Busan 47227, South Korea; [Choi, Yung Hyun] Dong Eui Univ, Dept Biochem, Coll Korean Med, Busan 47227, South Korea; [Noh, Jeong Sook] Tongmyong Univ, Dept Food Sci & Nutr, 428 Sinseon Ro, Busan 48520, South Korea","Noh, JS (corresponding author), Pusan Natl Univ, Dept Food Sci & Nutr, 2 Busandaehak Ro 63Beon Gil, Busan 46241, South Korea.; Noh, JS (corresponding author), Pusan Natl Univ, Kimchi Res Inst, 2 Busandaehak Ro 63Beon Gil, Busan 46241, South Korea.; Cho, EJ (corresponding author), Tongmyong Univ, Dept Food Sci & Nutr, 428 Sinseon Ro, Busan 48520, South Korea.",jsnoh2013@tu.ac.kr; ejcho@pusan.ac.kr,,"Kim, Ji Hyun/0000-0001-6617-2129",Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Ministry of Education [NRF2017R1D1A3B03034845],This work was supported by the Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by the Ministry of Education (NRF2017R1D1A3B03034845).,,46,0,0,1,1,KOREAN NUTRITION SOC,SEOUL,"804 KST CTR, 635-4 YEOGSAM-SONG KANGNAM-KU, SEOUL, 135-703, SOUTH KOREA",1976-1457,2005-6168,,NUTR RES PRACT,Nutr.

Here, we tested whether maternal investment and ecological lifestyle are related to variation in brain size and organization across 100 chondrichthyans. We hypothesized that brain size and organization would vary with the level of maternal investment and habitat depth and complexity. We found that chondrichthyan brain organization varies along four main axes according to (1) absolute brain size, (2) relative diencephalon and mesencephalon size, (3) relative telencephalon and medulla size, and (4) relative cerebellum size. Increased maternal investment is associated with larger relative brain size, while ecological lifestyle is informative for variation between relative telencephalon and medulla size and relative cerebellum size after accounting for the independent effects of reproductive mode. Deepwater chondrichthyans generally provide low levels of yolk-only (lecithotrophic) maternal investment and have relatively small brains, predominantly composed of medulla (a major portion of the hindbrain), whereas matrotrophic chondrichthyans-which provide maternal provisioning beyond the initial yolk sac-found in coastal, reef, or shallow oceanic habitats have relatively large brains, predominantly composed of telencephalon (a major portion of the forebrain). We have demonstrated, for the first time, that both ecological lifestyle and maternal investment are independently associated with brain organization in a lineage with diverse life-history strategies and reproductive modes.","[Mull, Christopher G.; Dulvy, Nicholas K.] Simon Fraser Univ, Earth Oceans Res Grp, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada; [Yopak, Kara E.] Univ North Carolina Wilmington, Dept Biol & Marine Biol, Wilmington, NC 28403 USA","Mull, CG (corresponding author), Simon Fraser Univ, Earth Oceans Res Grp, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada.",creeas@gmail.com,,,J.

This method provides us with a very fast and accurate tracker. At first, we remove the haze, which is caused by the turbidity of the water from a captured image. After that, we apply YOLO to allow recognition and tracking of marine organisms, which include shrimp, squid, crab and shark.

In this study, we investigated the diversity of body forms in extant sharks using landmark-based geometric morphometric analyses on nearly all the known (ca. 470) extant sharks. We ran three different analyses: the 'full body,' 'precaudal body,' and 'caudal fin' analyses. Our study suggests that there are two basic body forms in sharks, a 'shallow-bodied' form (Group A) and 'deep-bodied' form (Group B), where all sharks essentially have one basic caudal fin design of a heterocercal tail despite some specializations. We found that swimming modes in sharks are highly correlated with body forms where Group A sharks are predominantly anguilliform swimmers and Group B sharks are represented by carangiform and thunniform swimmers. The majority of Group A sharks are found to be benthic whereas pelagic forms are relatively common among Group B sharks. Each of the two superorders of sharks, Squalomorphii and Galeomorphii, must have gone through complex evolutionary history where each superorder contains both Group A sharks and Group B sharks, possibly involving parallel evolution from one group to the other or at least one episode of evolutionary reversal.","[Sternes, Phillip C.; Shimada, Kenshu] DePaul Univ, Dept Biol Sci, 2325 North Clifton Ave, Chicago, IL 60614 USA; [Shimada, Kenshu] DePaul Univ, Dept Environm Sci & Studies, 1110 West Belden Ave, Chicago, IL 60614 USA; [Shimada, Kenshu] Ft Hays State Univ, Sternberg Museum Nat Hist, 3000 Sternberg Dr, Hays, KS 67601 USA; [Sternes, Phillip C.] Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Evolut Ecol & Organismal Biol, 900 Univ Ave, Riverside, CA 92521 USA","Sternes, PC (corresponding author), DePaul Univ, Dept Biol Sci, 2325 North Clifton Ave, Chicago, IL 60614 USA.; Sternes, PC (corresponding author), Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Evolut Ecol & Organismal Biol, 900 Univ Ave, Riverside, CA 92521 USA.",philsternes77@gmail.com,,,,,,74,1,1,4,4,ELSEVIER GMBH,MUNICH,"HACKERBRUCKE 6, 80335 MUNICH, GERMANY",0944-2006,,,ZOOLOGY,Zoology,JUN,2020,140,,,,,,,,125799,10.1016/j.zool.2020.125799,,,13,Zoology,Zoology,LT9GU,WOS:000537375000016,32413674,Bronze,,,9/10/20

Here, we developed an ecological trait model to predict the categorical conservation status of 22 Northeast Atlantic and 13 Mediterranean Sea Data Deficient sharks and rays. We first developed an explanatory cumulative link mixed model based on regionally data-sufficient species on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List of Threatened Species (TM) using maximum body size, median depth, and reproductive mode, then predicted the statuses of Data Deficient species. Species exclusive to the Mediterranean were 3.8 times more likely to be threatened than species exclusive to the Northeast Atlantic. Over half of Northeast Atlantic (55%, n = 12 of 22), and two-thirds of Mediterranean (62%, n = 8 of 13) Data Deficient species were predicted to be threatened. When applied to all data-sufficient species, the mean predictive accuracy was 71% and 66% for the Northeast Atlantic and Mediterranean models, respectively. Overall, Northeast Atlantic Data Deficient species are predicted to be 1.4 times more threatened than data-sufficient species proportionally (39% assessed-threatened, n = 38 of 98), whereas threat levels in the Mediterranean Sea are similarly high for both (65% assessed-threatened, n = 39 of 60 data-sufficient). With the growing availability of vertebrate trait databases, trait-based, categorical prediction of conservation status is a cost-effective approach towards incorporating Data Deficient species into unbiased (i) estimates of lineage-wide extinction rates, (ii) protected species lists, and (iii) Red List Indices, thus preventing poorly-known species from reaching extinction unnoticed.","[Walls, Rachel H.

Fossils of mollusks have been discovered on its shores since the XIX century, and in recent years, several new remains of invertebrates and vertebrates have been found in the Brazilian area of the lake that provide insights on the geological evolution and environmental changes that affected this lake during the late Quaternary. In this first of two papers describing these new findings we focus on vertebrates, consisting of aquatic and terrestrial taxa. The former include the first associated fossil remains of one adult and one juvenile balaenid whale known in Brazil, probably a female and calf of the southern right whale (baleia-franca) Eubalaena australis, besides bull sharks (Carcharhinus leucas) also recorded for the first time in southern Brazil, rays (Dasyatidae and Myliobatidae) and teleost fishes. The fossils of terrestrial vertebrates include several extinct mammals, found on the margins and retrieved from the lake bottom by fishermen at depths of up to 4 m. One molar tooth of Toxodon discovered in situ in one irrigation channel yielded an electron spin resonance (ESR) age of 68 +/- 13 ka, in agreement with an age of 32.8 +/- 5.1 ka obtained in quartz grains extracted from a caliche nodule collected above that fossil and dated by optically-stimulated luminescence (OSL). Other quartz grains in the same nodule that yielded ages of 16.9 +/- 2.5 ka indicate partial dissolution of the caliche by increased rainfall at the beginning of the last glacial-interglacial transition (Termination I) . The lake was invaded by marine waters and organisms during the Holocene sea-level highstand of +3 m around 5-6 ka b2k through paleo-connections with the Atlantic Ocean, becoming a paleo-lagoon. At that time coastal waters were warmer than today, as indicated by the presence of the tropical shark C. leucas. The ESR and OSL ages indicate chronocorrelation with the Pleistocene fossil-bearing Santa Vitoria Formation that outcrops to the east. The fossil and sedimentary records indicate that the geological evolution and environmental conditions of the lake were controlled by climate and sea-level oscillations related to glacial-interglacial cycles.","[Lopes, Renato Pereira; Dillenburg, Sergio Rebello] Univ Fed Rio Grande do Sul, Inst Geociencias, Agron, Ave Bento Goncalves 9500, BR-91540000 Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil; [Pereira, Jamil Correa] Museu Coronel Tancredo Fernandes de Melo, Rua Barao do Rio Branco 467, BR-96230000 Santa Vitoria Do Palmar, RS, Brazil; [Tatumi, Sonia Hatsue; Yee, Marcio] Univ Fed Sao Paulo, UNIFESP, Campus Baixada Santista, BR-11015020 Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil; [Graciano Figueiredo, Ana Maria] Inst Pesquisas Energet & Nucl IPEN, Ave Lineu Prestes 2242,Cidade Univ, BR-05508000 Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil; [Kinoshita, Angela] Univ Sagrad Coracao USC, PRPPG, Rua Irma Arminda 10-50,Campus Univ, BR-17011160 Bauru, SP, Brazil; [Kinoshita, Angela] Univ Oeste Paulista UNOESTE, Rodovia SP-270,Km 572,Campus 2, BR-19067175 Presidente Prudente, SP, Brazil; [Baffa, Oswaldo] Univ Sao Paulo FFCLRP USP, Dept Fis, Fac Filosofia Ciencias & Letras Ribeirao Preto, Ave Bandeirantes 3900, BR-14040901 Ribeirao Preto, SP, Brazil","Lopes, RP (corresponding author), Univ Fed Rio Grande do Sul, Inst Geociencias, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil.",paleonto_furg@yahoo.com.br; jcorreapereira@bol.com.br; sergio.dillenburg@ufrgs.br; sonia.tatumi@gmail.com; marcioyee@hotmail.com; anamaria@ipen.br; angelamitie@gmail.com; baffa@usp.br,"Kinoshita, Angela/C-6946-2012","Kinoshita, Angela/0000-0002-5057-1667; Lopes, Renato/0000-0002-4865-6426",Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPq)National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq) [150153/2014-7],"The authors would like to express their gratitude for the people who found and donated the fossils described here to the museum Coronel Tancredo Fernandes de Mello: Edmilson Pereira (antler PV1003), Eranio dos Santos Rodrigues (antler PV1006), Gilson Borges Moreno (antler 1102), Jaime Renato Silveira do Amaral (molar PV0435) Jandira Correa Borges (vertebrae PV1206, 1207 and 1208), Maicon Machado Souza (osteoderm PV1181 and phalanx 1182), Neurimar Borba Muniz (pterygiophore PV0457) and Oldemar Borges Moreno (femur PV0981).

MITSUKURII,"Japan is known for its marine biodiversity and diverse ecosystem due to its unique geological composition and water currents creating suitable habitats for a wider range of marine species. A rich deep-sea shark community with high endemism occurs on the continental shelf. Yet, the deep-sea shark taxonomy is still under development and poorly documented. Here, a DNA barcoding technique was adopted using the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I (COI) and NADH2 genes of samples collected from Japan with additional samples from genetic databases to draft out a phylogenetic tree of the deep-sea shark genus Squalus (dogfishes). The morphological divergence of congeners was further examined. Bayesian and maximum-likelihood-based species-level phylogenetic analyses of mitochondrial COI, ND2 and combined sequences provided strong support for distinct clades corresponding to the parental species with substantial sequence divergence between parental species. The combined dataset of the COI and ND2 gene was most suitable for barcoding of Squalus dogfishes. A multivariate analysis of morphological traits was largely consistent with the genetic data showing small but discrete differences in phenotypic characteristics allowing to separate Squalus species. Genetic samples of the taxonomically problematic Shortspine spurdog 'Squalus mitsukurii from the Atlantic Ocean and Taiwan did not match with the type material of S. mitsukurii Jordan & Snyder, 1903 from mainland Japan. Squalus mitsukurii once considered a globally distributed species is a single, unique spurdog restricted to temperate Japan and Korea and may present an endemic in the Northwestern Pacific. This study further resolved two genetically and phenotypically distinct species of Squalus dogfishes in Japan, one in sympatry with S. mitsukurii in mainland Japan and one in sympatry with subtropical waters associated congeners in the Ryukyu Archipelago. The occurrence of populations of the 'high-fin Taiwan spurdog, Squalus formosus, in subtropical Japan is herein confirmed.","[Ziadi-Kunzli, F.] Okinawa Inst Sci & Technol Grad Univ, Nonlinear & Nonequilibrium Phys Unit, Onna, Okinawa 9040495, Japan; [Soliman, T.] Okinawa Inst Sci & Technol Grad Univ, DNA Sequencing Sect, Onna, Okinawa 9040495, Japan; [Soliman, T.] Natl Inst Oceanog & Fisheries, 101 Kasr Al Ainy St, Cairo, Egypt; [Imai, H.; Tachihara, K.] Univ Ryukyus, 1 Senbaru, Nishihara, Okinawa 9030213, Japan; [Sakurai, M.] Univ Ryukyus, Grad Sch Engn & Sci, 1 Senbaru, Nishihara, Okinawa 9030213, Japan; [Maeda, K.] Okinawa Inst Sci & Technol Grad Univ, Marine Genom Unit, Onna, Okinawa 9040495, Japan","Ziadi-Kunzli, F (corresponding author), Okinawa Inst Sci & Technol Grad Univ, Nonlinear & Nonequilibrium Phys Unit, Onna, Okinawa 9040495, Japan.",fabienne.ziadi@oist.jp; tahabasheirhassan.soliman@oist.jp; imai@sci.u-ryukyu.ac.jp; ken.maeda@oist.jp; ktachiha@sci.u-ryukyu.ac.jp,"Maeda, Ken/G-4189-2015; Soliman, Taha/G-4081-2015","Maeda, Ken/0000-0003-3631-811X; Soliman, Taha/0000-0003-3185-3092","Nonlinear and Non-equilibrium Physics Unit, OIST Graduate University; JSPS KAKENHIMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [16K07492]; University of the Ryukyus","This work was supported by the Nonlinear and Non-equilibrium Physics Unit, OIST Graduate University, the University of the Ryukyus and in parts through JSPS KAKENHI (Grant number 16K07492).",,106,0,0,4,4,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0967-0637,1879-0119,,DEEP-SEA RES PT I,Deep-Sea Res.

To date, metrics of thermal stress within marine systems have focussed on coral communities, and less is known about measuring stress relevant to other primary producers, such as seagrasses. An extreme MHW occurred across the Western Australian coastline in the austral summer of 2010-2011, exposing marine communities to summer seawater temperatures 2-5 degrees C warmer than average. Using a combination of satellite imagery and in situ assessments, we provide detailed maps of seagrass coverage across the entire Shark Bay World Heritage Area (ca. 13,000 km(2)) before (2002 and 2010) and after the MHW (2014 and 2016). Our temporal analysis of these maps documents the single largest loss in dense seagrass extent globally (1,310 km(2)) following an acute disturbance. Total change in seagrass extent was spatially heterogeneous, with the most extensive declines occurring in the Western Gulf, Wooramel Bank and Faure Sill. Spatial variation in seagrass loss was best explained by a model that included an interaction between two heat stress metrics, the most substantial loss occurring when degree heating weeks (DHWm) was >= 10 and the number of days exposed to extreme sea surface temperature during the MHW (DaysOver) was >= 94. Ground truthing at 622 points indicated that change in seagrass cover was predominantly due to loss of Amphibolis antarctica rather than Posidonia australis, the other prominent seagrass at Shark Bay. As seawater temperatures continue to rise and the incidence of MHWs increase globally, this work will provide a basis for identifying areas of meadow degradation, or stability and recovery, and potential areas of resilience.","[Strydom, Simone; Wilson, Shaun; Rule, Michael] Dept Biodivers Conservat & Attract, Biodivers & Conservat Sci, Marine Sci Program, 17 Dick Perry Ave, Kensington, WA 6151, Australia; [Strydom, Simone] Edith Cowan Univ, Ctr Marine Ecosyst Res, Joondalup, WA, Australia; [Strydom, Simone] Edith Cowan Univ, Sch Sci, Joondalup, WA, Australia; [Murray, Kathy; Huntley, Bart; Zdunic, Katherine] Dept Biodivers Conservat & Attract, Biodivers & Conservat Sci, Remote Sensing & Spatial Anal Program, Kensington, WA, Australia; [Wilson, Shaun; Kendrick, Gary A.; Fraser, Matthew W.] Univ Western Australia, Sch Biol Sci, Crawley, WA, Australia; [Wilson, Shaun; Kendrick, Gary A.; Fraser, Matthew W.] Univ Western Australia, Oceans Inst, Crawley, WA, Australia; [Heithaus, Michael] Florida Int Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Ctr Coastal Oceans Res, Miami, FL 33199 USA; [Bessey, Cindy] CSIRO, Indian Ocean Marine Res Ctr, Oceans & Atmosphere, Crawley, WA, Australia; [Burkholder, Derek] Nova Southeastern Univ, Halmos Coll Nat Sci & Oceanog, Dania, FL USA","Strydom, S (corresponding author), Dept Biodivers Conservat & Attract, Biodivers & Conservat Sci, Marine Sci Program, 17 Dick Perry Ave, Kensington, WA 6151, Australia.",simone.strydom@dbca.wa.gov.au,,"Wilson, Shaun/0000-0002-4590-0948; Bessey, Cindy/0000-0002-4081-0214; Heithaus, Michael/0000-0002-3219-1003; Rule, Michael/0000-0001-7278-8317","Department of Biodiversity, Conservation and Attractions Funding Source: Medline",,,111,6,6,14,19,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1354-1013,1365-2486,,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOL,Glob.

For example, in the Gulf of Mexico (GoM) 98 species of cestodes have been reported to date; however, data on their intraspecific genetic variation and population genetic studies are lacking. The trypanorhynch cestode, Oncomegas wageneri, is found (among other places) off the American Western Atlantic Coast, including the GoM, and has been reported as an adult from stingrays and from several teleost species in its larval form (as plerocerci). This study represents the first report of 2 previously unregistered definitive hosts for O. wageneri, namely the Atlantic sharpnose shark Rhizoprionodon terraenovae and the southern stingray Hypanus americanus. In this work, partial sequences of the 28S (region D1-D2) ribosomal DNA were analyzed to include O. wageneri within an eutetrarhynchoid phylogenetic framework. All O. wageneri individuals (which included plerocerci and adults) were recovered as monophyletic and Oncomegas celatus was identified as the sister species of O. wageneri. Furthermore, population genetic analyses of O. wageneri from the southern GoM were carried out using DNA sequences of the mitochondria! cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (COI) gene, which reflected high genetic variation and a lack of genetic structure among the 9 oceanographic sampling sites. Based on these results, O. wageneri is panmictic in the southern GoM. More extensive sampling along the species entire distribution is necessary to make more accurate inferences of population genetics of O. wageneri.","[Martinez-Aquino, Andres] Univ Autonoma Baja California, Fac Ciencias, Carretera Transpeninsular 3917, Ensenada 22860, Baja California, Mexico; [Vidal-Martinez, Victor M.; Soler-Jimenez, Lilia C.; Leopoldina Aguirre-Macedo, M.] Inst Politecn Nacl, Dept Recursos Mar, Lab Patol Acuat, Ctr Invest & Estudios Avanzados,Unidad Merida, Carretera Antigua Progreso Km 6, Merida 97310, Yucatan, Mexico; [Sara Ceccarelli, F.] CONACYT Ctr Invest Cient & Educ Super Ensenada, Dept Biol Conservac, Carretera Ensenada Tijuana, Ensenada 22860, Baja California, Mexico; [Mendez, Oscar] Univ Veracruzana, Fac Biol Xalapa, Lab Hidrobiol, Circuito Gonzalo Aguirre Beltran S-N Zona Univ, Xalapa 91090, Veracruz, Mexico","Vidal-Martinez, VM (corresponding author), Inst Politecn Nacl, Dept Recursos Mar, Lab Patol Acuat, Ctr Invest & Estudios Avanzados,Unidad Merida, Carretera Antigua Progreso Km 6, Merida 97310, Yucatan, Mexico.",vvidal@cinvestav.mx,"Aguirre-Macedo, Ma.

This paper presents a novel method to digitize an arbitrary surface, either from nature or manmade, replicate it, modify it, and print it. A banana skin, an eastern wahoo leaf, and a coin were digitized using a 3D laser scanning confocal microscope and modified with arbitrary additional textures. The digitized surfaces were then printed using a UV-sensitive polymer based on two-photon polymerization. The printed surfaces replicate the original surfaces with submicron accuracy; and additional textures were added to illustrate the ability to modify the surface topography. This method enables novel surface topographies to be created that cannot be found in nature.","[Maddox, Shelby] Univ Arkansas, Microelect Photon, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA; [Afshar-Mohajer, Mahyar; Zou, Min] Univ Arkansas, Dept Mech Engn, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA","Zou, M (corresponding author), Univ Arkansas, Dept Mech Engn, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA.",mzou@uark.edu,,"Maddox, Shelby/0000-0002-1381-5044; Zou, Min/0000-0003-0647-0890","Center for Advanced Surface Engineering, under the National Science Foundation [OIA-1457888]; Arkansas EPSCoR Program, ASSET III","Funding for this research was provided by the Center for Advanced Surface Engineering, under the National Science Foundation Grant No. OIA-1457888, the Arkansas EPSCoR Program, ASSET III.

Clasper descriptions are available only for a few catshark species and most of these are focused only in external morphology. Besides that, divergences regarding the identification of some structures persist in the literature emphasizing the need of more encompassing morphological comparative analyses on claspers of scyliorhinids. In this study, claspers structures of almost all catshark genera were examined, described, and illustrated (except Akheilos and Pentanchus) and comments on their phylogenetic significance are provided. Some characters such as degree of development of rhipidions and terminal dermal cover, occurrence, position and size of accessory marginal and terminal cartilages proved to be useful for taxonomic purposes and their significance along carcharhiniforms systematics needs to be further investigated.

Although global fin trade has decreased since 2000 meat trade has increased, with Brazil figuring as the largest shark meat importer worldwide. Still, in Brazil, elasmobranchs are traded under the label cacao making it difficult to monitor what species are actually being traded. To overcome elasmobranch fraudulent trade, molecular techniques have been developed aiding in illegal trade monitoring. Therefore, the objective of the present study was apply DNA barcoding technique (COI analysis) as a molecular support tool for the identification of shark species commercialized in the main fish markets of southern Brazil. A total of 650 base pairs (bp) of barcode COI from 231 samples were sequenced and analyzed, identifying 16 different elasmobranch species, being 12 shark species and four batoid species. About 43.3% of the total sampled consists of species listed in some IUCN risk category (e.g. Carcharias taurus, Carcharhinus falciformis, Sphyrna lewini, S. zygaena, Squatina gug,genheim). A key step for conservation would be encourage the consumer to demand the correct identification of the meat consumed. Such an attitude may influence the decision of supermarkets and fish markets to purchase only correctly identified products, which in turn would lead to the need for specialists actively and constantly working alongside fishery landings.","[Bernardo, Cristina; Bornatowski, Hugo] Univ Fed Parana, Programa Posgrad Sistemas Costeiros & Ocean PGSIS, Pontal Do Parana 83255976, Parana, Brazil; [Correa de Lima Adachi, Aisni Mayumi B.; da Cruz, Vanessa Paes; Foresti, Fausto] Univ Estadual Paulista Julio de Mesquita UNESP, Lab Biol & Genet Peixes LBGP, Inst Biociencias Botucatu IBB, Botucatu 18618689, SP, Brazil; [Loose, Robin H.; Bornatowski, Hugo] Assoc MarBrasil, Pontal Do Parana 83255000, Parana, Brazil","Bornatowski, H (corresponding author), Assoc MarBrasil, Pontal Do Parana 83255000, Parana, Brazil.",anequim.bio@gmail.com,,,Petrobras; CAPESCAPES,"We thank NGO MarBrasil Association for the field data collected under the project Rebimar III, financed by Petrobras.

A total of 63 whale sharks (50 male, 13 female) were sampled from the two localities (La Paz Bay n = 32, Yucatan Peninsula n = 31) in Mexico. Isotopic signatures differed greatly between both localities with mean values for delta N-15 in La Paz Bay (13.5 +/- 0.1 parts per thousand) being considerably higher than the Yucatan Peninsula (8.3 +/- 0.1 parts per thousand). As for delta C-13 both localities represented similar means (La Paz Bay - 15.4 +/- 0.5%o, Yucatan Peninsula - 14.2 +/- 0.1 parts per thousand). A Mann-Whitney U test revealed no significant differences between sexes at localities for delta N-15 (La Paz Bay, p > .05, Yucatan Peninsula, P > .05) and also for delta C-13 (La Paz Bay, p > .05, Yucatan Peninsula, P > .05). Between size groups of individuals ( < 6 m - > 6 m), significant differences were observed in the delta N-15 for whale sharks solely from La Paz Bay (p < .05), while no differences were found for delta C-13 at both localities. A significant relationship was observed between animal size and delta N-15 values, only for La Paz Bay (r(2) = 0.27, p <= .05). Analysis focused on the isotopic niches within each locality, revealed that individuals from La Paz Bay occupied the largest isotopic niche area compared with the Yucatan Peninsula, suggesting that animals from this population are using a different isoscape outside of the Gulf of California compared to a more uniform use of the habitat in the Gulf of Mexico. Ultimately, this study provided the first isotopic assessment of whale sharks at two unique geographical sites, providing key information that reveals differences in the base of the food web can affect the overall isotopic values.","[Whitehead, D.

Our study analyzes a multi-specific artisanal fishery (<10 TGR) operating from La Paloma port (Uruguay, South America) within the MPA of the Rocha Lagoon Protected Landscape (MPA-RLPL) through the temporal assessment (September 2005 to January 2010) of daily catch composition, fishing gear, and fish community dynamics. Seventeen vessels operated inside and outside the MPA-RLPL and they reached 202,773 kg of total catch within that MPA. This amount represents 9.1% of landings registered in La Paloma port during the study period (5 years). Following the seasonal dynamics of catch composition and fishing gears it was revealed a differential use of this coastal protected area by the artisanal fisheries and the fish community. Higher catches of Squatina guggenheim, Mustelus schmitti, Galeorhinus galeus, Urophycis brasiliensis, Paralichtys orbignyanus, and Cynoscion guatucupa occurred from spring-summer, whereas in fall-winter, the higher catches were composed of Micropogonias furnieri (adults and juveniles), Umbrina canosai, Pomatomus saltatrix, and Parona signata. A multiclass classification tree (CART) method confirmed the strong relationship between the catch composition, fishing gear, and time of fishing (month, season); this method successfully classified the dominant catches in 72% of the sets (error = 18%, n = 294). Squatina guggenheim (a threatened coastal shark), and Micropogonias furnieri (a overexploited bony fish) were the dominant catch in most fishing sets. At the present there are no specific measures to regulate fishery activities inside the MPA of the RLPL. Thus, our study results were used to propose an adaptive strategy to management small-scale fisheries within MPAs in balance with natural resources conservation. The key role of the MPA-RLPL in conservation ecology was revealed through a comparative analysis with larger areas distributed in the jurisdictional waters of Uruguay or under binational management with Argentina.","[Vogler, Rodolfo; Gonzalez, Clara; Segura, Angel M.] Univ Republica, Ctr Univ Reg Este, Sede Rocha Cure Rocha, Modelizac & Anal Recursos Nat MAREN, Montevideo, Uruguay","Vogler, R (corresponding author), UdelaR, CURE Rocha, Ruta Nacl 9 Km 205, Ciudad De Rocha 27000, Rocha, Uruguay.",rodolfovogler@gmail.com,,,"Fondo Vaz Ferreira [019, MEC-D2C2]","R.V. and A.M.S. thanks to DT Central Commission-UdelaR, SNI-ANII and PEDECIBA (Biologia: R.V., A.M.S.).

These rocks have different textural characteristics related to depositional and diagenetic processes, which influence the pore system and consequently the permeability. Understanding how the different facies are distributed and their relationship with petrophysics is essential to preview the quality of a reservoir. In this study, we classify the shell beds of the Itapema Formation through taphonomic characteristics, applying the concept of taphofacies, where taphonomic patterns such as orientation of shells, degree of packing, fragmentation of shells, abrasion, rounding, and sorting (type of grains) are used to differentiate shell concentrations. Six taphofacies (Tf-1 to Tf-6) were described in a core interval of 12 m, which corresponds to the Itapema Formation. Taphofacies Tf-1 and Tf-2 are well-sorted and unsorted grainstones/ rudstones with parallel-oriented and densely packed shells with a braded valves. Taphofacies Tf-3 and Tf-4 are well-sorted and unsorted grainstones/rudstones with oblique oriented shells, generally well-preserved but often with high shell dissolution. Taphofacies Tf-5 and Tf-6 are well-sorted and unsorted grainstones/rudstones with randomly oriented shells and densely packed deposits. In general, all the well-sorted taphofacies are composed mainly of shells and their fragments, do not show mud matrix or even shell fragments smaller than 0.2 mm, the size of valves varies from 0.5 to 5 mm and shell fragments are the smallest components. The unsorted taphofacies contain grains smaller than 0.2 mm, most of them peloids, and very small shell fragments. Through the analysis of thin sections, x-ray tomography (CT), high resolution tomography (H-CT) and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) it was possible to quantify the porosity in the described taphofacies and classify them according to Choquette and Pray (1970) and Ahr (2008). In well-sorted taphofacies primary pores are preserved; the total porosity varies from 9% to 21% in thin sections, and mainly consists of interparticle, intraparticle, and moldic pores and vugs. The control of porosity varies from depositional to hybrid 1, according to Ahr (2008), and pores are generally connected. In unsorted taphofacies, preserved primary porosity is uncommon and most pores are moldic and vugs. The total porosity in this facies varies from 2 to 15%, although almost all values are between 10% and 15%. The control of porosity varies from hybrid 1 to diagenetic, based on Ahr (2008), and the connectivity varies. Despite these textural differences between well-sorted and unsorted taphofacies, in general, the porosity is good and varies between 10% and 25%. The permeability in well-sorted taphofacies varies from 0.3 to 8 D, the high values being associated with a connected porous system, whereas in unsorted taphofacies the permeability varies from 0.01 to 0.4 D due to the occurrence of isolated vugs and moldic pores. The well-sorted coquinas were interpreted as deposits influenced by storm-induced currents and waves where the energy was sufficient to winnow the finer grains and preserve the primary pores. The taphonomic characteristics indicate tempestites to shoreface deposits, whereas in unsorted taphofacies the energy was not sufficient to remove finer grains generally associated with distal tempestites and backshore deposits.","[Chinelatto, Guilherme Furlan; Pocas Belila, Aline Maria; Basso, Mateus; Ponte Souza, Joao Paulo; Vidal, Alexandre Campane] Univ Estadual Campinas UNICAMP, Ctr Estudos Petroleo CEPETRO, Rua 06 Agosto,50 First Floor, Campinas, SP, Brazil","Chinelatto, GF (corresponding author), Univ Estadual Campinas UNICAMP, Ctr Estudos Petroleo CEPETRO, Rua 06 Agosto,50 First Floor, Campinas, SP, Brazil.",gfchinelatto@gmail.com; alinebelila@yahoo.com.br; bassomgeo@gmail.com; joao.ponte.souza@gmail.com; acvidal@gmail.com,,,CAPESCAPES; Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior - Brasil (CAPES)CAPES [001],"The authors acknowledge financial support provided by CAPES.

The redescription of the holotype of Ptychodus mediterraneus and lectotype fixations for P. latissimus and P. polygyrus allow the systematic reassessment of the three low-crowned Ptychodus species. In addition, these taxa are compared with other morphologically similar species, such as P. martini and P. marginalis. Micropalaeontological analyses suggest a Turonian age for the low-crowned P. mediterraneus. Based on articulated tooth sets of P. mediterraneus, the pavement-like dentitions of this durophagous taxon are reconstructed herein, revealing a marked dignathic heterodonty. Imbricated dentitions observed in articulated specimens of Ptychodus mediterraneus also suggest broad distributions of bite-induced load on tooth plates; the dental features of this low-crowned durophagous shark indicate a high specialization for grinding thick-shelled bivalves (e.g., inoceramids and rudists). Fragments of cranial mineralized cartilages (e.g., a 'V-shaped' jaw portion) of P. mediterraneus are consistent to those commonly occurring in fusiform sharks. Evidences of scavenging on Ptychodus recorded on cartilages and tooth-bioerosion are also reported herein. Moreover, a posterior-to-anterior tooth replacement is hypothesized for Ptychodus based on the abrasion patterns observed in articulated dental sets. New insights on the palaeoecology and palaeobiology of Ptychodus are also provided. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the lack of data for most species makes it difficult to use conventional population assessments to estimate their status. The productivity and susceptibility analysis (PSA) has been recommended for elasmobranchs as it is a data-poor assessment that uses the best available information of the species and their fisheries to determine their vulnerability. A historical characterisation was performed to define the most important periods for the shark fishery in Campeche, southern Gulf of Mexico, and a PSA was conducted to determine the vulnerability of the eleven most important commercial shark species in each three periods. The periods were defined as: local commercialisation (1940-1979), when all species had their lowest vulnerability values, and Carcharhinus leucas, Negraprion brevirostris, and Sphyrna mokarran were classified as highly vulnerable; developed industry (1980-1998) when there was an increase of the fishing pressure, and most small species changed from low to moderate vulnerability and the large coastal sharks scored their highest vulnerability values; and declining industry (1999-2018), when all species had lower vulnerability values than in the developed industry period. However, Carcharhinus brevipinna, Ginglymostoma cirratum, N. brevisrostris, C. leucas, and S. mokarran were still classified as highly vulnerable and could be suffering the accumulative effects of decades of fishing pressure. This multidisciplinary approach serves to identify the most vulnerable species throughout the history of the fishery and to understand the vulnerability values within a historical context, avoiding the shifting baseline syndrome.","[Martinez-Candelas, I.

The tuna purse seine industry takes advantage of this associative behavior and has been increasingly deploying free-drifting man-made floating objects, also known as fish aggregating devices (FADs). Using passive acoustic telemetry, this study describes the associative dynamics of the main targeted tropical tuna species (Thunnus albacores, T. obelus and Katsuwonus pelamis), as well as three major bycatch species, silky shark (Carcharhinus falciformis), rainbow runner (Elagatis bipinmdata) and oceanic triggerfish (Canthidermis maculata). Short-term excursions away from the FADs were frequently performed by all tuna species as well by silky sharks. These excursions were characterized by a marked diel pattern, mainly occurring during nighttime. Rainbow runners and oceanic triggerfish were much more present at the FADs and rarely performed excursions. Average continuous residence times (CRTs) ranged from 6 days, for silky shark, up to 25 days for bigeye tuna. Similar to silky shark, average CRTs for skipjack tuna and oceanic triggerfish were less than 10 days. For yellowfin tuna and rainbow runner, CRTs averaged 19 and 16 days, respectively. Bigeye and yellowfin tuna remained associated to a single drifting FAD for a record of 55 days and 607 km traveled.","[Tolotti, Mariana Travassos; Forget, Fabien; Capello, Manuela; Dagorn, Laurent] Univ Montpellier, IFREMER, CNRS, MARBEC,IRD, Sete, France; [Filmalter, John David] South African Inst Aquat Biodivers, Grahamstown, South Africa; [Hutchinson, Melanie] Univ Hawaii, Joint Inst Marine & Atmospher Res, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Itano, David] 689 Kaumakani St, Honolulu, HI USA; [Holland, Kim] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Hawaii Inst Marine Biol, Kaneohe, HI USA","Tolotti, MT (corresponding author), Stn Ifremer, Ave Jean Monnet CS 30171, F-34203 Sete, France.",mariana.travassos@ird.fr,,"Filmalter, John/0000-0003-4542-925X",International Seafood Sustainability Foundation (ISSF); French National Research Agency (ANR)French National Research Agency (ANR) [ANR-14-ACHN0002],"This work was funded by the International Seafood Sustainability Foundation (ISSF).

However, despite demonstration of secondary stress responses in a number of elasmobranchs, our understanding of the endocrine control of these responses is lacking. This is largely due to the unusual structure of the dominant corticosteroid in elasmobranch fish, la-hydroxycorticosterone (1 alpha-OH-B). Here we describe plasma extraction and HPLC separation procedures that allowed for the measurement of 1 alpha-OH-B and corticosterone from plasma samples in the cannulated, conscious free-swimming Japanese banded houndshark, Triakis scyllium. While patterns of concentration in the plasma for 1 alpha-OH-B and corticosterone were found to be similar in all experiments conducted, circulating levels of 1 alpha-OH-B were consistently 100-fold greater than circulating levels of corticosterone. Immediately following cannulation surgery, circulating levels of 1 alpha-OH-B increased 7-fold compared to pre-surgery levels, while the levels were 11-fold higher than pre-stress levels 30 min post a repeated handling/air-exposure stress. A three week period of fasting resulted in a 22-fold increase in circulating levels of 1 alpha-OH-B in the banded houndshark. This is the first report of direct measurement of changes in circulating levels of the primary corticosteroid in elasmobranch fish, 1 alpha-OH-B, following exposure to a stressor such as handling/air-exposure. Data indicate the steroid may respond similarly to the classic glucocorticoid response, such as cortisol in teleosts.","[Iki, Ayuko; Anderson, W.

There is a limited amount of published research directly related to HMS and OPPs. This may be due to the relatively recent offshore expansion of the industry and of studies. Most studies have focused on structure-associated species such as rockfishes and snappers. Within the U.S. exclusive economic zone, the most probable areas of interaction between HMS and OPPs occur in the Gulf of Mexico. This report focuses primarily upon this region, while noting that HMS roam the majority of the world's oceans and may interact with petroleum infrastructure in many other locations. With such large stock boundaries it is unlikely that HMS interactions with OPPs will have a significant impact at the stock level, however, there could be impacts at local or regional levels.","[Snodgrass, Derke J.

Embryos of oviparous elasmobranchs may be further challenged during development by rising temperatures and falling dissolved oxygen concentrations in their intertidal environment. However, the impact of climate change on survival and growth of oviparous elasmobranchs is still poorly understood. Here, we investigate the effects of temperature and hypoxia on the growth and survival of small-spotted catshark (Scyliorhinus canicula) embryos by incubating eggs in normoxia 15 degrees C, normoxia 20 degrees C, hypoxia 15 degrees C, or hypoxia 20 degrees C. Incubation under the elevated temperature increased the embryonic growth rate, yolk consumption rate and Fulton's condition factor at hatching, whilst decreasing the total length and body mass of newly hatched sharks. Under low oxygen conditions (50% air saturation) the survival rate ofS. caniculaembryos dropped significantly and the temperature-induced increase in Fulton's condition factor was reversed. Together, these data demonstrate both the individual and compound effects of elevated temperature and hypoxia on the survival and growth during early ontogeny of a ubiquitous, coastal elasmobranch,S. canicula.","[Musa, Syafiq M.; Ripley, Daniel M.; Shiels, Holly A.] Univ Manchester, Fac Biol Med & Hlth, 3-15d Core Technol Facil,46 Grafton St, Manchester M13 9NT, Lancs, England; [Musa, Syafiq M.] Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Fac Sci & Technol, Dept Earth Sci & Environm, Marine Sci Programme, Bangi, Malaysia; [Moritz, Timo] Deutsch Meeresmuseum, Stralsund, Germany; [Moritz, Timo] Friedrich Schiller Univ Jena, Inst Zool & Evolutionary Res, Jena, Germany","Shiels, HA (corresponding author), Univ Manchester, Fac Biol Med & Hlth, 3-15d Core Technol Facil,46 Grafton St, Manchester M13 9NT, Lancs, England.",holly.shiels@manchester.ac.uk,"Musa, Syafiq/AAF-9567-2019","Musa, Syafiq/0000-0001-9170-2646; Ripley, Daniel/0000-0001-5912-6722","Ministry of Higher Education (KPT, Malaysia); Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia (UKM); Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research CouncilBiotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC); Higher Education Innovation Fund through the University of Manchester's Knowledge and Innovation Hub for Environmental Stability","S.M.M. is supported by the Ministry of Higher Education (KPT, Malaysia) and Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia (UKM).

Two different types of baiting techniques were compared: bait bags where squid were placed into 2-mm mesh bags, and tied bait where squid were tied into meshes. Both types of baited gillnets significantly increased the capture of the target species, Greenland halibut, with increases of 253.8% and 149.7% for the bait bag and tied bait, respectively. Common bycatch species showed mixed effects, with roughhead grenadier Macrourus berglax Lacepede showing no increase in catch per unit effort (CPUE) for either bait type (p > 0.05), and porcupine crab Neolithodes grimaldii (Milne-Edwards and Bouvier) only had a higher CPUE with baited gillnets when bait bags were placed on the footrope. Less common bycatch species-but with threatened populations-showed an increase in CPUE, including Greenland shark Somniosus microcephalus (Bloch and Schneider) and Northern wolffish Anarhichas denticulatus Kroyer.

To investigate habitat preference and the influence of water quality on movement of bull sharks, we monitored 36 juveniles using an array of acoustic receivers in the Logan and Albert Rivers, Australia, for 30 months. Acoustic data were used to estimate mean daily distance upstream, and generalized additive models were used to determine the influence of flow, salinity, temperature, dissolved oxygen, turbidity, and chlorophyllaon movement. A model that included flow, salinity, dissolved oxygen, and chlorophyllaexplained 89% of the variance. Movement was tightly correlated to both flow and salinity with sharks moving downstream in response to increasing flow/declining salinity and upstream during low flow/increasing salinity. During periods of negligible flow and stable salinity, animals moved upstream and downstream in response to decreasing and increasing dissolved oxygen, respectively. Dissolved oxygen and temperature were strongly negatively correlated and interchangeable within the model. Despite fluctuations in environmental salinity (0-32 psu) and a strong declining gradient in salinity with increasing distance upstream, bull sharks remained within a narrow band of salinity (6-10 psu) throughout the tracking period. The results of this study indicate that habitat choice by juvenile bull sharks is a complex tradeoff between physiology, food availability, and predator avoidance, resulting in large differences between adjacent systems and more broadly across their range.","[Pillans, R.

We used 10 yr (2009-2018) of data from commercial fisheries and a bather protection program along the coast of New South Wales (NSW), southeastern Australia, to investigate (1) spatial and temporal patterns of occurrence in bull sharks and (2) environmental factors affecting bull shark occurrence along the coast of NSW. Predicted future distribution for this species was modelled for the forecast strengthening East Australian Current. Bull sharks were mostly harvested in small to larger estuaries, with average depth and rainfall responsible for contrasting patterns for each of the fisheries. There was an increase in the occurrence of bull sharks over the last decade, particularly among coastal setline fisheries, associated with seasonal availability of thermal gradients >22 degrees C and both westward and southward coastal currents stronger than 0.15 and 0.60 m s(-1), respectively, during the austral summer. Our model predicts a 3 mo increase in the availability of favourable water temperatures along the entire coast of NSW for bull sharks by 2030. This coast-line provides a uniquely favourable topography for range expansion in the face of a southerly shift of warmer waters, and habitat is unlikely to be a limiting factor for bull sharks in the future. Such a southerly shift in distribution has implications for the management of bull sharks both in commercial fisheries and for mitigation of shark-human interactions.","[Niella, Yuri; Harcourt, Robert] Macquarie Univ, Dept Biol Sci, N Ryde, NSW 2113, Australia; [Smoothey, Amy F.; Peddemors, Victor] Sydney Inst Marine Sci, Fisheries Res, NSW Dept Primary Ind, Mosman, NSW 2088, Australia","Niella, Y (corresponding author), Macquarie Univ, Dept Biol Sci, N Ryde, NSW 2113, Australia.",yuri.niella@gmail.com,,"Niella, Yuri/0000-0003-1878-6091; Harcourt, Robert/0000-0003-4666-2934",International Macquarie University Research Training Program scholarship,"The authors are grateful to O.

Naturally, many biological surfaces having unique micro-nanostructures, such as lotus leaves, butterfly wings, rose petals and shark skin, exhibit skills and attribute beyond conventional engineering. These skills and characteristic properties are exploited by several scientists to produce bioinspired materials by mimicking biological materials. Scientists called these materials as biomimetic materials as they are developed by inspiration from nature. For the last few decades, an extensive research has been going on to introduce a wide variety of biomimetic materials which can exhibit advanced properties. This paper gives an overview of recently developed biomimetic materials such as Se-modified carbon nitride nanosheets, small intestinal submucosa, magnesium-strontium hydroxyapatite, dimethylglyoxime-urethane polyurethane, polydimethylsiloxane, Ag/Ag@AgCl/ZnO and PDTC(COOH)(4)/HA, along with their biological properties.

Notwithstanding the rich fossil record of the modern great white shark (Carcharodon carcharias, GWS), its use of nursery areas in the fossil record has never been assessed before. Here, we analysed the fossil record of the GWS from three South American Pliocene localities, assessed body size distributions and applied previously established criteria to identify palaeo-nurseries. We found that juveniles dominate the Coquimbo locality (Chile), whereas subadults and adults characterize Pisco (Peru) and Caldera (Chile), respectively. These results, summed to the paleontological and paleoenvironmental record of the region, suggest that Coquimbo represents the first nursery area for the GWS in the fossil record. Our findings demonstrate that one of the top predators in today's oceans has used nursery areas for millions of years, highlighting their importance as essential habitats for shark survival in deep time.","[Villafana, Jaime A.; Kriwet, Juergen] Univ Vienna, Geoctr, Dept Palaeontol, Althanstr 14, A-1090 Vienna, Austria; [Villafana, Jaime A.] Univ Bernardo OHiggins, Ctr Invest Recursos Nat & Sustentabilidad, Santiago, Chile; [Hernandez, Sebastian; Alvarado, Alonso] Univ VERITAS, Ctr Int Programs, Biomol Lab, San Jose 10105, Costa Rica; [Hernandez, Sebastian] Univ Catolica Norte, Fac Ciencias Mar, Sala Colecc Biol, Coquimbo, Chile; [Shimada, Kenshu] Depaul Univ, Dept Environm Sci & Studies, Chicago, IL 60614 USA; [Shimada, Kenshu] Depaul Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Chicago, IL 60614 USA; [Shimada, Kenshu] Sternberg Museum Nat Hist, Hays, KS 67601 USA; [Pimiento, Catalina] Swansea Univ, Dept Biosci, Swansea SA2 8PP, W Glam, Wales; [Pimiento, Catalina] Smithsonian Trop Res Inst, Balboa, Panama; [Rivadeneira, Marcelo M.] Ctr Estudios Avanzados Zonas Aridas CEAZA, Lab Paleobiol, Coquimbo, Chile; [Rivadeneira, Marcelo M.] Univ Catolica Norte, Fac Ciencias Biol, Dept Biol Marina, Larrondo 1281, Coquimbo, Chile; [Rivadeneira, Marcelo M.] Univ La Serena, Dept Biol, Av Raul Bitran 1305, La Serena, Chile","Villafana, JA (corresponding author), Univ Vienna, Geoctr, Dept Palaeontol, Althanstr 14, A-1090 Vienna, Austria.; Villafana, JA (corresponding author), Univ Bernardo OHiggins, Ctr Invest Recursos Nat & Sustentabilidad, Santiago, Chile.",villafanaj88@univie.ac.at,,,"Becas-Chile Scholarship; Advanced Human Capital Program of the National Comission for Scientific and Techological Research (CONICYT, Chile); SYNTHESYS grant (DE-TAF); University of Vienna","We thank C.

The Florida Big Bend is home to a diverse assemblage of fauna; and the ecosystem is regionally important through its support of robust fishing (recreational and commercial) and eco-tourism industries. Stable isotope analyses suggest assemblages of fishes in the Florida Big Bend are trophically diverse, with considerable isotopic overlap across many taxa. Patterns of trophic structure corroborated the results of similar studies of these and related taxa and in other seagrass ecosystems, and there appear to be multiple channels of primary production. Large elasmobranch fishes were most enriched in delta N-15 with values well above the teleost fishes sampled, while smaller and demersal elasmobranchs had delta N-15 signatures comparable to several species of predatory teleosts. Results of stable isotope analyses suggested high trophic redundancy and overlap in resource use among both teleost and elasmobranch fishes. Comparisons of regional stable isotope values revealed some spatial variability and indicated the southern Big Bend is isotopically distinct, suggesting a distinct regional faunal zone in this region, potentially due to greatly reduced river influence in the southern portion of the system.","[Peterson, Cheston T.] Florida State Univ, 319 Stadium Dr, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA; [Grubbs, R.

The apparent trend among apex predators for some evolving into feeding on small zooplankton is of interest for understanding the associated shifts in anatomy and behaviour, while the spatial and temporal distribution gives clues to an inherent relationship with ocean primary productivity and how past and future perturbations to these may impact on the different tiers of the food web. The evolution of large nektonic suspension feeders-'gentle giants'-occurred four times among chondrichthyan fishes (e.g. whale sharks, basking sharks and manta rays), as well as in baleen whales (mysticetes), the Mesozoic pachycormid fishes and at least twice in radiodontan stem group arthropods (Anomalocaridids) during the Cambrian explosion. The Late Devonian placoderm Titanichthys has tentatively been considered to have been a megaplanktivore, primarily due to its gigantic size and narrow, edentulous jaws while no suspension-feeding apparatus have ever been reported. Here, the potential for microphagy and other feeding behaviours in Titanichthys is assessed via a comparative study of jaw mechanics in Titanichthys and other placoderms with presumably differing feeding habits (macrophagy and durophagy). Finite-element models of the lower jaws of Titanichthys termieri in comparison to Dunkleosteus terrelli and Tafilalichthys lavocati reveal considerably less resistance to von Mises stress in this taxon. Comparisons with a selection of large-bodied extant taxa of similar ecological diversity reveal similar disparities in jaw stress resistance. Our results, therefore, conform to the hypothesis that Titanichthys was a suspension feeder with jaws ill-suited for biting and crushing but well suited for gaping ram feeding.","[Coatham, Samuel J.; Vinther, Jakob; Rayfield, Emily J.] Univ Bristol, Life Sci Bldg,24 Tyndall Ave, Bristol, Avon, England; [Klug, Christian] Univ Zurich, Palaontol Inst & Museum, Karl Schmid Str 4, CH-8006 Zurich, Switzerland; [Coatham, Samuel J.] Univ Manchester, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Michael Smith Bldg,Dover St, Manchester, Lancs, England","Coatham, SJ (corresponding author), Univ Bristol, Life Sci Bldg,24 Tyndall Ave, Bristol, Avon, England.; Coatham, SJ (corresponding author), Univ Manchester, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Michael Smith Bldg,Dover St, Manchester, Lancs, England.",sam.coatham@postgrad.manchester.ac.uk,,"Vinther, Jakob/0000-0002-3584-9616; Klug, Christian/0000-0002-4099-7453; Coatham, Sam/0000-0003-4597-6210",Swiss National Science Foundation SNFSwiss National Science Foundation (SNSF),C.K. was supported by the Swiss National Science Foundation SNF.,,96,0,0,1,1,ROYAL SOC,LONDON,"6-9 CARLTON HOUSE TERRACE, LONDON SW1Y 5AG, ENGLAND",2054-5703,,,ROY SOC OPEN SCI,R.

Despite the strong link between metabolism and temperature in ectotherms, there is a paucity of data regarding how the metabolic ecology of species affects growth and fitness under such circumstances. Here, we integrated data describing field metabolic rates and body condition of two sympatric species of ectotherms with divergent lifestyles, the benthic freshwater (or largetooth) sawfish (Pristis pristis) and the epipelagic bull shark (Carcharhinus leucas) occurring in the Fitzroy River, Western Australia, to test the implications of their differing metabolic ecologies for vulnerability to rising temperatures. Over a temperature range of 18-34 degrees C, sawfish had lower field metabolic rates (63-187 mg O-2 kg(-0.86) h(-1)) and lower temperature sensitivity of metabolic rates [activation energy (E-A) = 0.35 eV] than bull sharks (187-506 mg O-2 kg(-0.86) h(-1); E-A = 0.48 eV). Both species lost body mass throughout the dry season, although bull sharks significantly more (0.17% mass loss day(-1)) than sawfish (0.07% mass loss day(-1)). Subsequent bioenergetics modelling showed that under future climate change scenarios, both species would reach potentially lethal levels of mass loss during dry season periods before the end of the century. These results suggest that ectotherms with low metabolic rates may be better suited to extreme environmental conditions, and that even small increases in temperature due to climate change could have substantial impacts on the ability of ectotherms to grow and survive in harsh conditions, including high temperatures and energy-limiting circumstances.","[Lear, Karissa O.; Morgan, David L.; Whitt, Jeff M.; Byrnes, Evan E.; Beatty, Stephen J.; Gleiss, Adrian C.] Murdoch Univ, Harry Butler Inst, Ctr Sustainable Aquat Ecosyst, 90 South St, Murdoch, WA 6150, Australia; [Lear, Karissa O.; Byrnes, Evan E.; Gleiss, Adrian C.] Murdoch Univ, Environm & Conservat Sci, 90 South St, Murdoch, WA 6150, Australia; [Whitney, Nicholas M.] New England Aquarium, Anderson Cabot Ctr Ocean Life, 1 Cent Wharf, Boston, MA 02110 USA","Lear, KO (corresponding author), Murdoch Univ, Harry Butler Inst, Ctr Sustainable Aquat Ecosyst, 90 South St, Murdoch, WA 6150, Australia.; Lear, KO (corresponding author), Murdoch Univ, Environm & Conservat Sci, 90 South St, Murdoch, WA 6150, Australia.",k.lear@murdoch.edu.au,"Morgan, David L./H-9794-2019; Beatty, Stephen John/H-8702-2019","Morgan, David L./0000-0003-1948-1484; Beatty, Stephen John/0000-0003-2620-2826","Murdoch University Strategic Research Fund; Australian Research CouncilAustralian Research Council [150100321]; Forrest Research Foundation; Holsworth Wildlife Research Fund; Fisheries Society of the British Isles; Australia Pacific Science Foundation; Waitt Foundation; Graduate Women Western Australia; Australian Government Research Training Program ScholarshipAustralian GovernmentDepartment of Industry, Innovation and Science","We are greatly appreciative of support and assistance with fieldwork from the Nyikina-Mangala Rangers over many years, as well as a number of volunteers including T.

Here, we review the impacts of both direct and indirect human interactions on the reproductive biology of elasmobranchs. Within direct human influence, capture-induced stress from fisheries bycatch and poor coastal management practices leading to habitat destruction and pollution are among the most impactful on elasmobranch reproduction. Capture-induced stress has been shown to negatively influence offspring and reproductive capacity via capture-induced parturition as well as by disrupting the reproductive physiology of adults. Habitat degradation impacts essential ecosystems that are necessary for the development of young elasmobranchs. Pollutants such as heavy metals, legacy pesticides, and flame retardants have been traced through elasmobranch reproduction; however, the long-term effects of these exogenous chemicals are yet to be determined. Furthermore, within indirect human impacts, climate change-mediated influences (e.g., ocean warming and acidification) can impact development, physiological processes, and behavioral patterns necessary for essential tasks such as foraging, growth, reproduction, and ultimately survival. Here, we also present a case study, where data regarding temperature and incubation time from 28 egg-laying elasmobranch species were examined to show relevance of such data in predicting how suitable (e.g., via maximum threshold temperatures) habitats will be for skate and shark development in the coming century. Concomitantly, this information highlights areas for future research that will help inform better management as well as climate change forecasting for this threatened group of aquatic vertebrates.","[Wheeler, Carolyn R.; Johnson, Martijn S.; Rummer, Jodie L.] James Cook Univ, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia; [Wheeler, Carolyn R.; Vance, Shelby; Mandelman, John W.] New England Aquarium, Anderson Cabot Ctr Ocean Life, Boston, MA 02110 USA; [Wheeler, Carolyn R.; Mandelman, John W.] Univ Massachusetts, Sch Environm, Boston, MA 02125 USA; [Gervais, Connor R.] Macquarie Univ, Sydney, NSW 2109, Australia; [Rosa, Rui] Univ Lisbon, Fac Ciencias, Lab Maritimo Guia, MARE Marine & Environm Sci Ctr, Ave Nossa Senhora Cabo 939, P-2750374 Cascais, Portugal","Wheeler, CR (corresponding author), James Cook Univ, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia.",carolyn.wheeler23@gmail.com,"Gervais, Connor/AAP-8986-2020; Rosa, Rui/A-4580-2009; Rummer, Jodie/A-6524-2015","Gervais, Connor/0000-0001-6501-9798; Rosa, Rui/0000-0003-2801-5178; Rosa, Rui/0000-0002-6453-4277; Wheeler, Carolyn/0000-0001-9976-8420; Rummer, Jodie/0000-0001-6067-5892","Anderson Cabot Center for Ocean Life at New England Aquarium; University of Massachusetts Boston; American Australian Association; Fundacao para a Ciencia e Tecnologia (FCT, Portugal)Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology [UID/MAR/04292/2019, PTDC/AAG-GLO/1926/2014]; Australian Research Council (ARC) Early Career Discovery Fellowship (2015-2018)Australian Research Council; L'Oreal-UNESCO Women in Science Foundation Fellowship (2015-2016)","CRW is supported by a research assistantship jointly through the Anderson Cabot Center for Ocean Life at New England Aquarium and the University of Massachusetts Boston as well as a graduate fellowship from the American Australian Association.

We report the hearing abilities in the dogfish Scyliorhinus canicula at different stages, from embryos that still have their yolk sac inside their egg, to juveniles. Hearing development corresponds to an increase in the frequency range from 100-300 Hz in early pre-hatching stages to 100-600 Hz in juveniles. Modifications in hearing abilities correspond to the development of the brain, the increase of the volume of the membranous labyrinth, the growth of the sensory epithelium, and the development of stereocilia in addition to kinocilium before hatching. This work offers solid insights into the development of hearing abilities that usually can only be inferred from the anatomy of vertebrates or after birth/hatching.

Fourteen embryos were observed in total, in which two males in the left uterus presented different stages of mummification. Both mummified embryos were covered by an exudate (i.e., a mucous substance), indicating a hematic mummification process. All embryos were at the placentotrophic stage of development, indicating that they were close to parturition. An intrinsic characteristic is suggested as possible etiology for this condition, such as umbilical torsion, because both embryos were at different sizes and, therefore, at different development stages. In addition, the sample size did not allow the authors to presume any pollution effect once only one female was observed. Finally, fetal mummification and other embryonic development disorders might have populational impacts due to reduction in embryo survival and, consequently, recruitment. For this reason and considering that S. lewini is categorized as a critically endangered species, this study's results have conservational relevance.","[Martins, Mariana F.] Univ Fed Rio Grande FURG, Programa Posgrad Ciencias Fisiol, Inst Ciencias Biol, Ave Italia Km 8, BR-96203900 Rio Grande, RS, Brazil; [Martins, Mariana F.; Rolim, Fernanda A.; Gadig, Otto B.

An additional congeneric species, Cucullanus bioccai Orecchia et Paggi, 1987 was recorded from Mugil cephalus (Mugilidae, Mugiliformes) (first record in the Pacific Ocean) and Cucullanus sp. (only female) was found in Arothron manilensis (Tetraodontidae, Tetraodontiformes). Furthermore, two known cucullanid species, Dichelyne (Cucullanellus) branchiostegi (Yamaguti, 1941) in Branchiostegus wardi (Malacanthidae, Perciformes) (new host and geographical records) and Dichelyne (Cucullanellus) bodiani Moravec et Justine, 2019 in Bodianus busellatus (new host) and B. perditio (both Labridae, Perciformes), were found; Dichelyne (Cucullanellus) sp.

It is assumed to represent an ancient morphotype of sharks (e.g., terminal mouth opening, more than five gill slits) and thus is often considered to represent plesiomorphic traits for sharks. Therefore, its early ontogenetic developmental traits are important for understanding the evolution of its particular phenotype. Here, we established six stages for prenatal embryos and used linear measurements and geometric morphometrics to analyse changes in shape and size as well as their timing during different embryonic stages. Our results show a change in head shape and a relocation of the mouth opening at a late stage of development. We also detected a negative allometric growth of the head and especially the eye compared to the rest of the body and a sexual dimorphism in total body length, which differs from the known data for adults. A multivariate analysis of covariance shows a significant interaction of shape related to the logarithm of centroid size and developmental stage. Geometric morphometrics results indicate that the head shape changes as a covariate of body size while not accounting for differences between sexes. The growth pattern of stages 32 and 33 indicates a shift in head shape, thus highlighting the moment in development when the jaws start to elongate anteriorly to finally achieve the adult condition of terminal mouth opening rather than retaining the early embryonic subterminal position as is typical for sharks. Thus, the antero-terminal mouth opening of the frilled shark has to be considered a derived feature.","[Lopez-Ronnero, Faviel A.; Klimpfinger, Claudia; Kriwet, Juergen] Univ Vienna, Dept Paleontol, Vienna, Austria; [Tanaka, Sho] Tokai Univ, Fac Marine Sci & Technol, Sch Marine Sci & Technol, Shimizu Ku, Shizuoka, Japan","Lopez-Ronnero, FA (corresponding author), Univ Vienna, Geozentrum, Dept Paleontol, Althanstr 14, A-1090 Vienna, Austria.",faviel.alejandro.lopez.romero@univie.ac.at,,"Lopez Romero, Faviel/0000-0001-6500-0747; Kriwet, Jurgen/0000-0002-6439-8455",Universitat Wien,Universitat Wien,,95,0,0,3,3,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-1112,1095-8649,,J FISH BIOL,J.

To date, most scientific publications on this topic have focused on the collisions between large vessels and large whales. However, our review found that at least 75 marine species are affected, including smaller whales, dolphins, porpoises, dugongs, manatees, whale sharks, sharks, seals, sea otters, sea turtles, penguins, and fish. Collision incidents with smaller species are scarce, likely as a result of reporting biases. Some of these biases can be addressed through the establishment of species-specific necropsy protocols to ensure reliable identification of collision-related injury, particularly blunt force trauma. In addition, creating a ship strike database for smaller species can assist in identifying the species most frequently involved in collisions, identifying high-risk areas, and determining species-specific relationships between vessel speed and lethal injury. The International Whaling Commission database on collisions with large whales provides a good example of this type of database and its potential uses. Prioritizing the establishment of a species-specific necropsy protocol and a database for smaller species as well as the identification of high-risk areas for species other than large whales, would be a valuable step toward the mitigation of collisions with smaller species.","[Schoeman, Renee P.] Nelson Mandela Univ, Sch Environm Sci, Port Elizabeth, South Africa; [Patterson-Abrolat, Claire] Endangered Wildlife Trust, Modderfontein, South Africa; [Plon, Stephanie] Nelson Mandela Univ, Earth Stewardship Sci Res Inst, African Earth Observ Network, Port Elizabeth, South Africa","Schoeman, RP (corresponding author), Nelson Mandela Univ, Sch Environm Sci, Port Elizabeth, South Africa.",renee.p.schoeman@gmail.com,,,,,,277,0,0,5,5,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,2296-7745,,FRONT MAR SCI,Front.

The blacktip shark Carcharhinus limbatus is a popular recreational species targeted throughout the western, central and eastern Gulf of Mexico (Gulf) yet it is unclear what levels of physiological stress result from catch-release fishing practices with hook and line gear and if the stress levels result in post-release mortality. This study correlates physiological response to stress through blood chemistry analysis and examines post-release behaviour of adult blacktip sharks caught to determine post-release mortality rates. Release behaviour was determined by pop-up satellite archival transmitting (PSAT) tags that record temperature, depth and light level data. To quantify physiological stress levels, blood samples were collected from 52 blacktip sharks and a suite of metabolic and osmotic markers were measured. Thirty-six of those blacktip sharks were also outfitted with a PSAT tag yielding time-at-large from 3 to 180 days. Of the 36 tags, 22 (61%) provided sufficient data to confirm post-release fate and 11 (31%) were recovered providing high-resolution data. Tag data suggests a post-release morality rate of 22.7% (95% confidence interval 7.8-45.4%), with mortality occurring within minutes (immediate mortality) to over 12 h post-release (delayed mortality). Compared to survivors, immediate mortalities exhibited significantly higher lactate (median 2.8 mmol/L-survivor vs 5.9 mmol/(Limmediate mortality)) and significantly lower hematocrit (median 24.4% (survivor) vs 14% (immediate mortality)) levels, but no difference was detected between survivors and delayed mortalities. Higher mortality in the western (30%) compared to the central (20%) Gulf may be due to shark handling. All PSATs from mortalities (N = 5) were recovered, and archived data revealed evidence of tag ingestion by predators. Results suggest reduced fight time, decreased handling time and limited air exposure provide blacktip sharks the best survival chances after release by recreational anglers.","[Mohan, John A.; Wells, R.

In this work, we investigated the lowermost Middle Triassic (Ladinian) carbonate deposits in the Catalan Basin to evaluate the potential environmental mechanisms and evolutionary constrains involved in the kilometre-scale predominance of microbialites and the low-diversity and high-density Planolites association in a low-latitude epicontinental setting. The studied sedimentary succession records the development from a low-gradient, homoclinal microbial-dominated carbonate ramp evolving towards a slightly inclined swell-dominated type. Sedimentological analysis suggests that facies heterogeneity was controlled by pulses of syn-rift tectonic activity, which compromised Peri-Tethyan basin connectivity, reducing palaeobathymetry gradients. Although the monospecific nature of the studied trace-fossil association may reflect the delayed recovery after the end-Permian mass extinction, this is inconsistent with widespread, relatively high-diversity ichnofaunas in carbonates elsewhere in the region. Since other Ladinian basins were characterized by the recurrence of microbial carbonates, low-diversity ichnoassemblages and limited skeletal production, we hypothesize that shallow and restricted carbonate ramp settings harboured limited ecological complexity and widespread opportunistic colonization of the sediment when compared to coeval open marine locations.","[Mercedes-Martin, Ramon; Buatois, Luis A.] Univ Saskatchewan, Dept Geol Sci, 114 Sci Pl, Saskatoon, SK SKS7N 5E2, Canada","Mercedes-Martin, R (corresponding author), Univ Saskatchewan, Dept Geol Sci, 114 Sci Pl, Saskatoon, SK SKS7N 5E2, Canada.",info@ramonmercedes.com; luis.buatois@usask.ca,,"Mercedes-Martin, Ramon/0000-0002-4410-1984","Repsol Exploracion, S.A.; Spanish government's I + D+i research project [CGL2008-04916]; Consolider-Ingenio 2010 programmeSpanish Government [CSD 2006-0004]; Grup Consolidat de Recerca 'Geologia Sedimentaria' [2009SGR-1451]","We acknowledge Luca G.

Regions of oceanographic heterogeneity (e.g. current interfaces, habitat transition zones, ecological gradients) are strong candidates for the presence of ecologically divergent natural selection, but their role in the radiation of elasmobranch species is yet to be tested. We used an integrative framework to assess the relative influence of oceanographic heterogeneity and geological history on the diversification of an elasmobranch genus. Location Gulf of California (GC) and Baja California Peninsula (BCP), Mexico. Taxon Shovelnose guitarfish (genus Pseudobatos). Methods We sampled 210 Pseudobatos specimens from four distinct but physically connected oceanographic regions within the GC and in the BCP. We used genetic (mtDNA sequences and AFLP genotypes) and environmental (six oceanographic variables) datasets to clarify phylogenetic relationships, demographic history and evolutionary divergence among populations, and to test for associations between ecologically driven selection and reproductive isolation. Results Phylogenetic and population genetic evidence exposed five distinct lineages of Pseudobatos in the region, including four cryptic lineages in the GC. Phylogeographic analyses indicate a recent history of ecologically driven diversification associated with the Gulf's young oceanographic environment and its four ecologically discrete regions. This hypothesis was supported by seascape genetics, ecological niche modelling and by tests of selection. Main conclusions We propose an adaptive radiation for the genus Pseudobatos linked with habitat heterogeneity of the GC. Our study likely represents the first assessment of an ecological radiation in the highly diverse elasmobranch group. It capitalizes on the environmental and biogeographic settings of the GC to offer a new perspective about the application of integrative approaches to study divergent natural selection and diversification in the sea.","[Sandoval-Castillo, Jonathan; Beheregaray, Luciano B.] Flinders Univ S Australia, Mol Ecol Lab, Coll Sci & Engn, Adelaide, SA 5001, Australia; [Sandoval-Castillo, Jonathan; Beheregaray, Luciano B.] Macquarie Univ, Mol Ecol Lab, Sch Biol Sci, Sydney, NSW, Australia","Sandoval-Castillo, J (corresponding author), Flinders Univ S Australia, Mol Ecol Lab, Coll Sci & Engn, Adelaide, SA 5001, Australia.",jonathan.sandoval-castillo@flinders.edu.au,"Sandoval-Castillo, Jonathan/AAY-3670-2020; Beheregaray, Luciano/A-8621-2008","Sandoval-Castillo, Jonathan/0000-0002-8428-3495; Beheregaray, Luciano/0000-0003-0944-3003","Australian Research CouncilAustralian Research Council [DP110101275, FT130101068]; Macquarie University","Australian Research Council, Grant/Award Number: DP110101275 and FT130101068; Macquarie University",,126,0,0,3,3,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0305-0270,1365-2699,,J BIOGEOGR,J.

Nevertheless, literature on fish hearing is discordant in methodology and limited to a small fraction of known species. The literature on fish audition (N = 63) supported four classes associated with swim bladder specialization: species without swim bladders, those with unmodified and modified swim bladders, and those with Weberian ossicles or bullae. These classes were compared for audition (detected frequency) in addition to the effects of methodology and imposed sound type on detected frequency. Maximum and optimum frequencies that fish detected increased with swim bladder presence and elaboration. Methods of testing audition and the form of sound measured affected the maximum and optimum frequencies detected by fish, but when statistically accounted for did not affect the rankings of hearing classes. Although the review supported frequency detection tied to swim bladder specialization, true hearing performance remains poorly known owing to the limited number of studies that have evaluated how fish perceive sound as particle motion rather than sound pressure.","[Wiernicki, Caroline J.; Liang, Dong; Bailey, Helen; Secor, David H.] Univ Maryland, Chesapeake Biol Lab, Ctr Environm Sci, Solomons, MD 20688 USA","Wiernicki, CJ (corresponding author), Univ Maryland, Chesapeake Biol Lab, Ctr Environm Sci, Solomons, MD 20688 USA.",cjwiernicki@gmail.com,,,,,,101,0,0,4,4,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",2330-8249,2330-8257,,REV FISH SCI AQUAC,Rev.

Depending on body size, thermal tolerance, and ability to avoid predators, horn sharks may need to balance tradeoffs when selecting a quality shelter. This study quantified vertical daytime distributions via dive surveys and shelter fidelity via acoustic telemetry during June - August 2016 and June - November 2017 in a temperate rocky reef (33 & x2da;26' N, -118 & x2da;29' W). Immature individuals (< 58 cm TL) were found refuging in shallower (< 10 m), warmer habitats consisting of smaller crevices and overhangs, whereas mature individuals (> 58 cm TL) were found in deeper (> 10 m), cooler habitats sheltering in larger caves and rock ledges. The sizes and relative abundances of sharks varied between land-associated and offshore-isolated reefs, indicating habitat type may be a likely driver of ontogenetic shifts in shelter behavior. No sharks returned to their shelters in 2016 coinciding with the period of El Nino conditions (increased temperature, shifts in community assemblage), yet shelter fidelity was 47% in 2017 under non-El Nino conditions. By quantifying sheltering behavior in a residential mesopredator, this study provides a framework for understanding how environmental conditions influence horn shark behaviors and their potential impacts on their community.","[Meese, Emily N.; Lowe, Christopher G.] Calif State Univ Long Beach, Dept Biol Sci, CSULB Shark Lab, Long Beach, CA 90840 USA; [Meese, Emily N.] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Marine Biol, Galveston, TX 77553 USA","Meese, EN (corresponding author), Texas A&M Univ, Dept Marine Biol, Galveston, TX 77553 USA.",emily.n.meese@gmail.com,,"Meese, Emily/0000-0003-4928-4297",USC Wrigley Graduate Fellowship; Donald.

Baited Remote Underwater Video Stations (BRUVS) are a useful tool in assessment of fish assemblages, but research on the optimal sampling period required to record common and rare elasmobranch species is limited. An appropriate 'soak time' (time elapsed between settlement of the BRUVS on the seabed and when it is hauled off the seabed) requires consideration, since longer soak times may be required to record species rare in occurrence, or sightings in areas of generally low elasmobranch abundance. We analysed 5352 BRUVS deployments with a range of soak times across 21 countries in the Coral Triangle and Pacific Ocean, to determine the optimal soak time required for sampling reef-associated elasmobranchs, considering species rarity, and community abundance at each site. Species were categorised into 4 'rarity' groups (very rare to common), by their relative occurrence in the dataset, defined simply by the proportion of BRUVS on which they occurred. Individual BRUVS were categorised into 3 'abundance' groups (low to high) by overall relative elasmobranch abundance, defined as total number of all elasmobranchs sighted per unit of sampling effort. The effects of BRUVS soak times, and levels of rarity and abundance groupings, on the time to first sighting (TFS) and time to maximum number of elasmobranchs observed (t(MaxN)) were examined. We found that TFS occurred earlier for species groups with high occurrence, and on BRUVS with high elasmobranch abundance, yet longer soak times were not essential to observe rarer species. Our models indicated an optimum of 95% of both sighting event types (TFS, t(MaxN)) was recorded within 63-77 minutes, and a soak time of 60 minutes recorded 78-94% of the elasmobranch sighting events recorded (78-94% of TFS events and 82-90% of t(MaxN) events), when species rarity and abundance on BRUVS was accounted for. Our study shows that deployments of similar to 77 minutes are optimal for recording all species we observed, although 60 minutes soak time effectively samples the majority of elasmobranch species in shallow coral reef habitats using BRUVS.","[Currey-Randall, Leanne M.; Cappo, Mike; Heupel, Michelle R.] Australian Inst Marine Sci, Townsville, Qld, Australia; [Simpfendorfer, Colin A.] James Cook Univ, Ctr Sustainable Trop Fisheries & Aquaculture, Townsville, Qld, Australia; [Simpfendorfer, Colin A.] James Cook Univ, Coll Sci & Engn, Townsville, Qld, Australia; [Farabaugh, Naomi F.] Florida Int Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Miami, FL 33199 USA; [Heupel, Michelle R.] Univ Tasmania, Integrated Marine Observing Syst IMOS, Hobart, Tas, Australia","Currey-Randall, LM (corresponding author), Australian Inst Marine Sci, Townsville, Qld, Australia.",currey@aims.gov.au,"Currey-Randall, Leanne/AAS-8975-2020","Currey-Randall, Leanne/0000-0002-3772-1288",Paul G Allen Philanthropies [11861]; Pew Foundation; Florida International University's Tropical Conservation Institute,"This work is a contribution of the Global FinPrint Project, supported by Paul G Allen Philanthropies under grant number 11861, Pew Foundation, and Florida International University's Tropical Conservation Institute.

Nevertheless, computations of the flow field over riblets in the practical configurations (e.g., airplanes and wind turbines) remain unfeasible for its huge computational cost. In this study, a general strategy for modelling the effects of riblets in turbulent flows is proposed. Riblets are modelled by adopting a slip-boundary condition on the smooth wall. A quantitative relationship between the riblet geometric parameters and the slip length is theoretically built for the first time. This modelling method could greatly reduce grid numbers in the validating procedure by using Large-Eddy Simulation, and the modelling results indicate that the flow fields in logarithmic and wake regions over riblets could be accurately reproduced. Additionally, considering the slip-boundary model is not capable of reproducing the near-wall flow, a simplified calculating method is developed.","[Zhang, Ziliang; Zhang, Mingming; Cai, Chang; Kang, Kai] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Engn Thermophys, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Ziliang; Zhang, Mingming; Cai, Chang; Kang, Kai] Chinese Acad Sci, Key Lab Wind Energy Utilizat, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Ziliang; Zhang, Mingming] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Mingming; Cai, Chang] Chinese Acad Sci, Dalian Natl Lab Clean Energy, Dalian, Peoples R China","Zhang, MM (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Engn Thermophys, Beijing, Peoples R China.; Zhang, MM (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Key Lab Wind Energy Utilizat, Beijing, Peoples R China.; Zhang, MM (corresponding author), Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China.; Zhang, MM (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Dalian Natl Lab Clean Energy, Dalian, Peoples R China.",mmzhang@iet.cn,,,National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [51736008]; Strategic Priority Research Programof the Chinese Academy of SciencesChinese Academy of Sciences [XDA21050303],This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant number 51736008) and Strategic Priority Research Programof the Chinese Academy of Sciences (grant number XDA21050303).,,50,0,0,9,9,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1061-8562,1029-0257,,INT J COMPUT FLUID D,Int.

Rays are a prevalent mesopredator in tropical coral reef ecosystems that are preyed upon by top predators like sharks. Studies have suggested reduced predator abundances lead to increases in mesopredator abundance (mesopredator release). We examined the relationship between top predator abundances and the abundance and behaviour of 2 small benthic ray genera using baited remote underwater video systems (BRUVS) across 6 countries. Where predators were more abundant, 2 genera of small benthic rays were sighted less often, possibly because of lower abundances. Small ray behaviour was also significantly affected by predator abundance. Individuals of focal ray species visited BRUVS significantly fewer times at sites with higher predator abundances. Where predators were less abundant, rays spent significantly more time in the video frame, and were more likely to feed from bait bags. In addition to predator abundance, small ray presence was significantly influenced by reef relief and depth. Neotrygon spp. were more abundant on deeper, lower relief habitats, while Taeniura spp. were more prevalent in reef-associated shallow, high relief habitats. Overall, this study found that predator abundance had a significant effect on small benthic ray abundance and behaviour in the presence of BRUVS. Results demonstrate that changes in both abundance and behaviour associated with predator loss may make the interpretation of phenomenon like mesopredator release more difficult to identify unless behavioural effects are considered.","[Sherman, C.

The influence of top predators on an ecosystem can vary if they occur within multiple habitat types and have a wide niche breadth due to spatiotemporal changes in diet. We examined spatial patterns in trophic position and niche width for an economically important reef-associated fishery species, the giant trevally Caranx ignobilis. We sampled 4 localities in the western Indian Ocean representing different habitats: coral atolls, coastal reefs, and granitic islands. We analyzed isotopic ratios of carbon (C-13/C-12) and nitrogen (N-15/N-14), and performed compound-specific amino acid stable isotope analysis (AA-CSIA) to control for baseline nitrogen variation. Our analysis of 12 juveniles and 43 adults revealed wide variation in trophic niche breadth between sampling sites and an offshore to coastal gradient in carbon that drove niche distinctiveness between localities. We observed niche width patterns suggestive of ontogenetic changes in diet and habitat utilization and larger niche sizes at the oceanic island sites than the coastal site. Trophic position estimates ranged from 3.5-5, expanding the trophic range of C. ignobilis relative to previous studies using AA-CSIA and placing it at the equivalent trophic level as many predatory sharks. Our study corroborates prior evidence that C. ignobilis is an important apex predator in reef and island ecosystems. Additionally, we show how evaluating spatiotemporal components of trophic ecology of marine predators is critical for characterizing their functional role and ecosystem influence, allowing for targeted conservation efforts.","[Glass, Jessica R.; Post, David M.] Yale Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Glass, Jessica R.; Daly, Ryan; Cowley, Paul D.] South African Inst Aquat Biodivers, ZA-6140 Grahamstown, South Africa; [Daly, Ryan] Oceanog Res Inst, Marine Parade, ZA-4056 Durban, South Africa","Glass, JR (corresponding author), Yale Univ, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.; Glass, JR (corresponding author), South African Inst Aquat Biodivers, ZA-6140 Grahamstown, South Africa.",jessica.glass@aya.yale.edu,,,Yale Institute for Biospheric Studies; National Science Foundation Doctoral Dissertation Improvement GrantNational Science Foundation (NSF); Yale Analytical Stable Isotope Center; Yale Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology Chair's Fund; Yale MacMillan Center International Dissertation Fellowship; GregoryWatkins-Colwell of the Yale Peabody Museum of Natural History; Roger Bills of the South African Institute for Aquatic Biodiversity,"We thank Brad Erkkila of the Yale Analytical Stable Isotope Center and Jaclyn Hill of the Maurice Lamontagne Institute for their assistance.

These microplastics eventually build up in the marine environment, threatening marine ecosystems. The magnitude, fate and effects of these microplastics across the food web are largely unknown. Here, we measured digested microplastics in a top predator and critically endangered species, the NorthEast Atlantic Porbeagle shark (Lamna nasus), and compared this with general health conditions. A method for quantifying microplastics in spiral valves of porbeagle sharks was developed. Microplastics were detected in all spiral valves, up to 10.4 particles per g wet weight (w.w.) content and 9.5 particles per g w.w. tissue. This equates to individual microplastics loads as high as 3850 particles per spiral valve, most likely a result of trophic transfer. No statistically significant correlations were found between the average number of plastic particles in spiral valve content and tissue and the Condition and Hepatosomatic Index of porbeagle sharks. The results of this research show that North-East Atlantic porbeagle sharks ingest and digest microplastics and that there is a potential for microplastic biomonitoring using this species. More research is needed to detect possible health effects of microplastic contamination in these apex predators.","[Maes, Thomas; Desender, Marieke; Bendell, Victoria A.] Ctr Environm Fisheries & Aquaculture Sci, Lowestoft Lab, Lowestoft, Suffolk, England; [Maes, Thomas; de Jel, Jael van Diemen; Vethaak, A.

The aim of the study was to determine the impact of the fungi and their toxins on the health status of brown trout (Salmo trutta morpha trutta) migrating from the Baltic Sea to the freshwater. Individuals from the wild brown trout population exhibiting ulcerative skin lesions were collected from the Slupia River in Poland and subjected to microbiological, histopathological, and hematological examinations, as well as toxicological analysis for a presence of mycotoxins. The results of microflora isolation from the brown trout skin samples revealed the presence of conditionally pathogenic bacteria and fungi classified by molecular techniques as Fusarium spp. Toxicological analysis allowed for detection of zearalenone (ZEN) in the liver, kidney, and gastrointestinal tract of the fish. In several cases, there was alpha-zearalenone (alpha-ZEL) identified at trace levels in the liver, as well as sterigmatocystin and enniatin B at low levels in the kidney and the liver. Histopathological examination revealed the presence of fungal hyphae disrupting the epidermis and penetrating into the necrotic dermis and hypodermis. The decreased values of the blood parameters, i.e., hemoglobin concentration (HGB), packed cell volume (PCV), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), and white blood cell count (WBC), were indicative of osmoregulation failure being a consequence of the skin damage. The results of the study provide new information regarding Fusarium sp. infection in brown trout and serve as the basis for further research on the potential impact of the fungi and their mycotoxins on the Baltic salmonid population, including their role in ulcerative dermal necrosis.","[Pekala-Safinska, Agnieszka; Pazdzior, Ewa] Natl Vet Res Inst, Dept Fish Dis, Al Partyzantow 57, Pulawy 24100, Poland; [Jedziniak, Piotr; Panasiuk, Lukasz] Natl Vet Res Inst, Dept Pharmacol & Toxicol, Al Partyzantow 57, Pulawy 24100, Poland; [Kycko, Anna] Natl Vet Res Inst, Dept Pathol, Al Partyzantow 57, Pulawy 24100, Poland; [Cieplinski, Mateusz; Kasprzak, Mariusz] Univ Zielona Gora, Fac Biol Sci, Dept Zool, Ul Prof Z Szafrana 1, Zielona Gora 65516, Poland; [Jerzak, Leszek] Univ Zielona Gora, Fac Biol Sci, Dept Nat Protect, Ul Prof Z Szafrana 1, Zielona Gora 65516, Poland","Pekala-Safinska, A (corresponding author), Natl Vet Res Inst, Dept Fish Dis, Al Partyzantow 57, Pulawy 24100, Poland.",A.Pekala@piwet.pulawy.pl,,"Pekala-Safinska, Agnieszka/0000-0002-5515-8329; Panasiuk, Lukasz/0000-0002-2300-3920","National Veterinary Research Institute in Pulawy, Poland; University of Zielona Gora, Poland","Presented studies were financed from own sources of the National Veterinary Research Institute in Pulawy and University of Zielona Gora, Poland.",,40,1,1,1,1,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0178-7888,1867-1632,,MYCOTOXIN RES,Mycotoxin Res.,AUG,2020,36,3,,,,,311,318,,10.1007/s12550-020-00395-8,,May-20,8,Mycology; Toxicology,Mycology; Toxicology,MJ1WU,WOS:000530595500001,32372256,"Green Published, Other Gold",,,9/10/20

However, many previous AVEDs have been designed for larger sharks, and there is a need for a technology that permits the collection of behavioral and ecological data for small sharks. In this study, we developed and tested the Shark Harness, a novel AVED technology for small to medium size sharks, in both the laboratory and the field. In the laboratory, the swimming behavior of seven dusky smoothhound sharks (Mustelus canis; n = 7) ranging in size from 90.00-114.30 cm total length (TL) was assessed. When compared to unmanipulated individuals, sharks fitted with the Shark Harness exhibited no significant variations in both swimming duration (p = 0.63) and vertical positioning (0.99), whereas a minor, yet statistically significant, increase in tail beat frequency (p = 0.016) was observed. In the field, six dusky smoothhound sharks (90-110.28 cm TL) equipped with the Shark Harness were released in waters near Montauk, New York, USA. Field data suggest that the Shark Harness can be used to assess fine-scale movements, heterospecific interactions, and immediate post-release survivorship of dusky smoothhound sharks and other small sharks (>= 80 cm TL) in a wild setting. However, future modifications are required prior to redeployment in a wild setting, including a more cryptic and hydrodynamic design, in order to obtain a more accurate representation of the respective animal's natural behavior and interactions with con- and hetero-specifics.","[P.

Nevertheless, the co-occurrence of selenium (Se) in organisms may affect the toxicity and bioavailability of Hg. In this work, we aim to demonstrate the possible role of Se as a potential protective element against Hg in muscle and liver tissues of three demersal deep-sea fish species: common mora Mora moro, birdbeak dogfish Deania calcea, and smooth lanternshark Etmopterus pusillus. Comparing species, the birdbeak dogfish D. calcea showed the highest Hg concentrations, the lowest Se levels, the lowest mean Se:Hg molar ratio, a negative HBV-Se index, and no correlation between total length. On the other hand, smooth lanternshark E. pusillus showed the lowest Hg concentrations, the highest Se concentrations, the highest mean Se:Hg molar ratio, a positive HBV-Se index, and a significant positive correlation between total length and Se concentrations in muscle. Comparing tissues, the common mora Mora moro seems to accumulate more Hg and Se in liver than shark species D. calcea and E. pusillus that showed to accumulate Hg and Se preferentially in muscle. Our results indicate that these three species for having Hg concentrations near and above the EU regulatory thresholds and for presenting low Se:Hg ratios, and negative (or low positive) HBV-Se index may pose a real risk of Hg toxicity for the consumer.","[Teixeira, Guilherme; Pacheco, Mario] Univ Aveiro, Dept Biol, Aveiro 3810193, Portugal; [Teixeira, Guilherme; Pacheco, Mario] Univ Aveiro, CESAM, Aveiro 3810193, Portugal; [Raimundo, Joana; Caetano, Miguel] Portuguese Inst Sea & Atmosphere, IPMA, Av Brasilia, Lisbon 1449006, Portugal; [Raimundo, Joana] Univ Porto, CIIMAR CIMAR, Interdisciplinary Ctr Marine & Environm Res, Matosinhos, Portugal; [Goulart, Joana; Costa, Valentina; Martins, Ines] Univ Azores, Dept Oceanog & Fisheries, IMAR, Horta 9901862, Portugal; [Goulart, Joana; Costa, Valentina; Menezes, Gui M.; Martins, Ines] Univ Azores, Fac Sci & Technol, OKEANOS Res Unit, Horta 9901862, Portugal","Martins, I (corresponding author), Univ Azores, Dept Oceanog & Fisheries, IMAR, Horta 9901862, Portugal.; Martins, I (corresponding author), Univ Azores, Fac Sci & Technol, OKEANOS Res Unit, Horta 9901862, Portugal.",ines.ca.martins@uac.pt,"Caetano, Miguel/A-9438-2013; Martins, Ines/A-5167-2013","Caetano, Miguel/0000-0001-5121-0719; Martins, Ines/0000-0002-5362-9801","Iceland through the EEA Financial Mechanism [PT-0040]; Liechtenstein through the EEA Financial Mechanism [PT-0040]; Norway through the EEA Financial Mechanism [PT-0040]; SRECC [M. 2.1.2/029/2011]; SEAMOV [PTDC/MAR/108232/2008]; Fundacao para a Ciencia e Tecnologia (FCT)Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology [UID/MAR/04292/2013, SFRH/BPD/73481/2010, SFRH/BPD/91498/2012]","This work was conducted under the framework of the projects CONDOR (PT-0040), co-financed by a Grant from Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway through the EEA Financial Mechanism, SMaRT financed by SRECC (ref.

Aim: To investigate the clinical manifestations of DMAc-induced symptoms and how to rescue the functional loss due to occupational exposure. Design: Clinical observations of 60 spandex factory workers with the exposure to DMAc from January, 2017-19. Methods: Chinese drugs (reduced glutathione, polyene phosphatidylcholine, glycyrrhizin compound, Hugan tablets and ornithine aspartate) were used to evaluate the therapeutic improvements in DMAc-exposed patients. Results: Our data found that 58.3% patients had no distinct clinical symptoms, but 41.7% patients felt fatigue, and 21.7% patients suffered abdominal discomfort and appetite loss, and 8.3% patients had yellow skin and sclera. The ultrasonic and CT imaging revealed that some patients have fatty livers, intrahepatic calcifications, hepatomegaly, gallbladder wall edema and abdominal effusions. Biochemical analysis showed that the alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (P<0.001), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (P<0.001), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (P<0.001) and bilirubin (P<0.01) statistically decreased after the drug treatment, but alkaline phosphatase (P>0.05) and glutamyl transpeptidase (P>0.05) did not decrease. Twenty-nine out of the thirty-one patients' abnormal blood ammonia recovered. The risk factor of ALT on hospitalization time was significantly related (P<0.01). Conclusions: The drugs above are sufficient to rescue functional loss in DMAc-induced toxic hepatitis, in part via the regulations of ALT, AST, LDH, bilirubin and ammonia. Workers with the exposure to DMAc should receive specific drugs to maintain the health and prevent functional loss in the long term.","[Wang, J.] Zhejiang Rongjun Hosp, Dept Gastroenterol, Jiaxing 314000, Peoples R China; [Chen, G.] Zhejiang Sci Tech Univ, Coll Life Sci & Med, Dept Biopharmaceut Sci, Hangzhou 310018, Peoples R China; [Chen, G.] Zhejiang Prov Key Lab Silkworm Bioreactor & Biome, Hangzhou 310018, Peoples R China","Chen, G (corresponding author), Zhejiang Prov Key Lab Silkworm Bioreactor & Biome, Hangzhou 310018, Peoples R China.; Chen, G (corresponding author), Zhejiang Sci Tech Univ, Coll Life Sci & Med, Hangzhou 310018, Peoples R China.",gqchen_123@163.com,,,Sci-Tech Planning Project of Zhejiang Province [2014C33122]; Department of Sci-Tech of Zhejiang Province [LGF19H140002],This work was supported by the Sci-Tech Planning Project of Zhejiang Province (2014C33122) and the Department of Sci-Tech of Zhejiang Province (LGF19H140002).,,26,0,0,0,1,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1460-2725,1460-2393,,QJM-INT J MED,QJM-An Int.

Sampling was conducted during autumn 2017 in two nearshore (Palm Tree and Al-Besheriya Islands) and two offshore locations (Sherawoo and Ishat Islands). Fish muscle and liver tissues were analyzed according to the US Environmental Protection Agency Method 1630. The lowest mean MeHg concentration was found to be 42.3 ppb wet weight in the lower trophic level fish Gerres oyena due to small fish size and trophic level; whereas, the highest MeHg concentration was found in higher trophic level sharks Rhizoprionodon oligolinx and Chiloscyllium arabicum with mean wet weight concentrations of 712 ppb and 166 ppb, respectively. Linear relationships were found between fish body size (weight, length, age) and MeHg concentrations. MeHg bioaccumulation was found to be higher in liver than in muscle tissue; however, there was no significant difference in tissue MeHg accumulation as well as, the concentrations between the four locations. The present study concludes that MeHg in most of the fish tissues is within the allowable limits and pose no threat to public health. Only the higher trophic level shark Rhizoprionodon oligolinx was found to have a MeHg concentration higher than the US EPA advisory level of 0.3 ppm. However, consumers should still be encouraged to eat smaller sized younger fish from lower trophic levels, which would be safer than larger older species from higher trophic levels.

Among the criteria used to discriminate Deania species one is dermal denticle length and body colour. In this study the authors explore the feasibility of these criteria and examine other morphological characters to investigate if sexual or ontogenic features had relevance for the distinction of the species particularly those sampled in this study, D. calcea and D. profundorum. Molecular analyses were conducted to validate these results. In D. calcea, dermal denticle length ranged from 340 mu m to 1400 mu m (763.2 mu m +/- 180.4 s.d.); in D. profundorum, dermal denticle length ranged from 195 mu m to 650 mu m (372.3 mu m +/- 111.7 s.d.). In both Deania species, a significant positive correlation was found between shark total length and dermal denticle length. Dermal denticles varied in size and shape along the shark body. These differences were significant both intra- and inter-specifically. A multivariate analysis based on morphological characters was used to test differences between D. calcea and D. profundorum. The hierarchical analysis clearly identified three groups; two groups corresponded to each species, and a third group discriminated between small and large individuals of D. profundorum. The morphometric characters that contributed most to the divergence between both species were mainly related to the size of the dorsal fins, the inter-dorsal distance and the distances from the snout to the origin of each dorsal fin. Based on morphological characters, no sexual dimorphism was observed. The phylogenetic tree was reconstructed with molecular COI sequences available on BOLD and those obtained in this study. The output tree discriminate D. calcea from D. profundorum, however could not separate molecularly D. calcea and D. hystricosa. (c) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, we assembled a database of weekly sightings to describe temporal (seasonal) patterns in the presence of elasmobranchs within an urban, semi-enclosed, landscape (Las Canteras beach, Gran Canaria Island, eastern Atlantic). Data also provided insight into their habitat use and population structure. From October 2015 to October 2018, eight species, either endangered or data deficient according to the IUCN red list, were reported, including: the common eagle ray, Myliobatis aquila , the common stingray, Dasyatis pastinaca , the round stingray, Taeniurops grabatus , the spiny butterfly ray, Gymnura altavela , the bull ray, Aetomylaeus bovinus , the angel shark, Squatina squatina , the marbled electric ray, Torpedo marmorata and the hammerhead shark, Sphyrna zygaena. All species were predominantly observed at night. The species varied in their habitat use; D. pastinaca , G. altavela and S. squatina dominated in sandy and mixed bottoms, while M. aquila and T. grabatus were mostly found in rocky and mixed bottoms. Both D. pastinaca and T. grabatus did not show any seasonal pattern, with consistent records all year around. In contrast, M. aquila , G. altavela and S. squatina showed some degree of seasonality. For five species, small-sized individuals were observed.

Importantly, populations are most often concurrently exposed to a suite of pathogens, which is rarely investigated, because contact networks are typically inferred from spatial proximity only. Here, we use 5 years of detailed observations of Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins (Tursions aduncus) that distinguish between four different types of social contact. We investigate how demography (sex and age) affects these different social behaviors. Three of the four social behaviors can he used as a proxy for understanding key routes of direct pathogen transmission (sexual contact, skin contact, and aerosol contact of respiratory vapor above the water surface). We quantify the demography-dependent network connectedness, representing the risk of exposure associated with the three pathogen transmission routes, and quantify coexposure risks and relate them to individual sociability. Our results suggest demography-driven disease risk in bottlenose dolphins, with males at greater risk than females, and transmission route-dependent implications for different age classes. We hypothesize that male alliance formation and the divergent reproductive strategies in males and females drive the demography-dependent connectedness and, hence, exposure risk to pathogens. Our study provides evidence for the risk of coexposure to pathogens transmitted along different transmission routes and that they relate to individual sociability. Hence, our results highlight the importance of a multibehavioral approach for a more complete understanding of the overall pathogen transmission risk in animal populations, as well as the cumulative costs of sociality.","[Leu, Stephan T.; Sah, Pratha; Krzyszczyk, Ewa; Jacoby, Ann-Marie; Mann, Janet; Bansal, Shweta] Georgetown Univ, Dept Biol, 510 Regents Hall, Washington, DC 20057 USA; [Leu, Stephan T.] Univ Adelaide, Sch Anim & Vet Sci, Roseworthy Campus, Roseworthy, SA 5371, Australia","Leu, ST; Bansal, S (corresponding author), Georgetown Univ, Dept Biol, 510 Regents Hall, Washington, DC 20057 USA.",stephan.leu@adelaide.edu.au; shweta.bansal@georgetown.edu,,"Bansal, Shweta/0000-0002-1740-5421","National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [1216054, 1414296, 1559380, 0918308, 0941487, 0316800]; Office of Naval Research BAAOffice of Naval Research [10230702]; Georgetown University; Australian Government, Department of Education and TrainingAustralian GovernmentDepartment of Industry, Innovation and Science; Australian Research Council DECRA FellowshipAustralian Research Council [DE170101132]","This work was supported by the National Science Foundation (1216054 and 1414296 to S.B.; 1559380, 0918308, 0941487, and 0316800 to J.M.); by an Office of Naval Research BAA grant (10230702 to J.M.); and grants to S.B. and J.M. from Georgetown University.

Surviving these challenging conditions requires global metabolic reorganization that is orchestrated, in part, by microRNAs that can rapidly and reversibly target all biological functions. Herein, we review the involvement of microRNAs in natural models of anoxia and hypoxia tolerance, with a focus on the involvement of oxygen-responsive microRNAs (OxymiRs) in coordinating the metabolic rate depression that allows animals to tolerate reduced oxygen levels. We begin by discussing animals that experience acute or chronic periods of oxygen deprivation at the ocean's oxygen minimum zone and go on to consider more elevated environments, up to mountain plateaus over 3500 m above sea level. We highlight the commonalities and differences between OxymiR responses of over 20 diverse animal species, including invertebrates and vertebrates. This is followed by a discussion of the OxymiR adaptations, and maladaptations, present in hypoxic high-altitude environments where animals, including humans, do not enter hypometabolic states in response to hypoxia. Comparing the OxymiR responses of evolutionarily disparate animals from diverse environments allows us to identify species-specific and convergent microRNA responses, such as miR-210 regulation. However, it also sheds light on the lack of a single unified response to oxygen limitation. Characterizing OxymiRs will help us to understand their protective roles and raises the question of whether they can be exploited to alleviate the pathogenesis of ischemic insults and boost recovery. This Review takes a comparative approach to addressing such possibilities.","[Storey, Kenneth B.] Carleton Univ, Inst Biochem, Ottawa, ON K1S 5B6, Canada; Carleton Univ, Dept Biol, Ottawa, ON K1S 5B6, Canada","Storey, KB (corresponding author), Carleton Univ, Inst Biochem, Ottawa, ON K1S 5B6, Canada.",KenStorey@cunet.carleton.ca,,"Storey, Kenneth/0000-0002-7363-1853; Hadj-Moussa, Hanane/0000-0002-3338-9046",Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada [6793]; Canada Research Chair in Molecular Physiology; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada,This work was supported by a Discovery grant (grant no. 6793) from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC).

Investigation of the pressure, volume, temperature (PVT) relationships for liver oils of 10 species of deep-sea Chondrichthyes shows that the density difference between oil and seawater, Delta rho, remains almost constant with pressure down to full ocean depth (11 km, 1100 bar), theoretically providing buoyancy far beyond the maximum depth of occurrence (3700 m) of sharks. However, Delta rho does change significantly with temperature and we show that the combined effects of pressure and temperature can decrease buoyancy of oil by up to 10% between the surface and 3500 m depth across interfaces between warm southern and cold polar waters in the Rockall Trough in the NE Atlantic. This increases drag more than 10-fold compared with neutral buoyancy during horizontal slow swimming (0.1 m s(-1)), but the effect becomes negligible at high speeds. Chondrichthyes generally experience positive buoyancy change during ascent and negative buoyancy change during descent, but contrary effects can occur at interfaces between waters of different densities. During normal vertical migrations buoyancy changes are small, increasing slow-speed drag no more than 2- to 3-fold.

Entanglement of invertebrates, sharks, turtles, birds and marine mammals is mainly caused by macroplastics (>5 mm), and leads to reduced mobility, ineffective foraging and subsequent mortality. The main plastic types associated with entanglement are improperly discarded fishing nets, lines, ropes and straps. In South Africa and surrounding waters, plastic ingestion has been reported in a number of marine species: sharks (n=10), fish (n=7), turtles (n=1) and birds (n=36). Lethal (macroplastic) and sub-lethal effects (microplastic <= 5 mm) of marine debris on biota have been noted, but at the time of this review there were no published reports on impacts at the population level. Consumed shellfish are possible vectors for the introduction of microplastics into humans. The specific impacts of microplastic ingestion on human health are largely unknown, but additives associated with plastics represent a threat. The research infrastructure in South Africa is insufficient to monitor and characterise marine plastic debris and, in many cases, not in line with global standards. More research effort is needed to understand the impacts of marine plastic debris on humans and marine biota in South Africa, particularly at the population level. Significance Macroplastics affect marine biota mainly via entanglement and microplastics largely through ingestion. Macro- and microplastic interactions with biota can result in sub-lethal effects and mortality but no population effects have been reported for South Africa. Consumed shellfish are a potential source of microplastics for humans but their potential effects in humans remain unknown. Better infrastructure is needed for improved monitoring and research on the effects of marine debris in South Africa.","[Naidoo, Trishan; Rajkaran, Anusha; Sershen] Univ Western Cape, Dept Biodivers & Conservat Biol, Cape Town, South Africa","Naidoo, T (corresponding author), Univ Western Cape, Dept Biodivers & Conservat Biol, Cape Town, South Africa.",trishan.naidoo2@gmail.com,,"Rajkaran, Anusha/0000-0001-7360-3660","Waste RDI Roadmap, Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, Department of Science and Innovation (South Africa); Commonwealth Litter Programme, Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science, Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (UK)","Waste RDI Roadmap, Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, Department of Science and Innovation (South Africa); Commonwealth Litter Programme, Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science, Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (UK)",,86,2,2,7,7,ACAD SCIENCE SOUTH AFRICA A S S AF,LYNWOOD RIDGE,"PO BOX 72135, LYNWOOD RIDGE 0040, SOUTH AFRICA",0038-2353,1996-7489,,S AFR J SCI,S.

This study describes the age and growth of P. anomala based on 734 specimens (340 females, 363 males, 31 unsexed) caught by trawl fishery in the north-eastern waters off Taiwan from March 2007 to July 2008. The age of specimens was estimated by counting the growth annuli in sagittal otoliths. The periodicity of annulus deposition on otolith was estimated to be one year with opaque zone deposited between July and August based on marginal increment analysis. The maximum age for both sexes was estimated to be similar to 4. The female portion of the population was dominated by the 3(+) age class, while the male portion was dominated by the 2 infinity age class. The parameters of the von Bertalanffy growth function with standard error estimated based on the observed length at age using a non-linear method are as follows: L-infinity = 25.47 +/- 0.65 cm, k = 0.30 +/- 0.03 year(-1), and t(0) = -1.84 +/- 0.16 year for females (n = 350), and L-infinity = 22.39 +/- 0.45 cm, k = 0.46 +/- 0.04 year(-1), and t(0) = -1.38 +/- 0.13 year for males (n = 378).

The bite was superficial, and N. acutidens are fish predators not known to feed on large prey; hence, foraging is an unlikely explanation for this incident rather linked to territoriality.

However, whether the composition of GSL mat communities covaries with microbialite morphology and lake environment is unknown. Moreover, the potential adaptations that allow the establishment of these extensive mat communities at high salinity (14% to 17% total salts) are poorly understood. To address these questions, microbial mats were sampled from seven locations in the south arm of GSL representing different lake environments and microbialite morphologies. Despite the morphological differences, microbialite-associated mats were taxonomically similar and were dominated by the cyanobacterium Euhalothece and several heterotrophic bacteria. Metagenomic sequencing of a representative mat revealed Euhalothece and subdominant Thiohalocapsa populations that harbor the Calvin cycle and nitrogenase, suggesting they supply fixed carbon and nitrogen to heterotrophic bacteria. Fifteen of the next sixteen most abundant taxa are inferred to be aerobic heterotrophs and, surprisingly, harbor reaction center, rhodopsin, and/or bacteriochlorophyll biosynthesis proteins, suggesting aerobic photoheterotrophic (APH) capabilities. Importantly, proteins involved in APH are enriched in the GSL community relative to that in microbialite mat communities from lower salinity environments. These findings indicate that the ability to integrate light into energy metabolism is a key adaptation allowing for robust mat development in the hypersaline GSL. IMPORTANCE The earliest evidence of life on Earth is from organosedimentary structures, termed microbialites, preserved in 3.481-billion-year-old (Ga) rocks. Phototrophic microbial mats form in association with an similar to 700-km(2) expanse of morphologically diverse microbialites in the hypersaline Great Salt Lake (GSL), Utah. Here, we show taxonomically similar microbial mat communities are associated with morphologically diverse microbialites across the lake. Metagenomic sequencing reveals an abundance and diversity of autotrophic and heterotrophic taxa capable of harvesting light energy to drive metabolism. The unexpected abundance of and diversity in the mechanisms of harvesting light energy observed in GSL mat populations likely function to minimize niche overlap among coinhabiting taxa, provide a mechanism(s) to increase energy yield and osmotic balance during salt stress, and enhance fitness. Together, these physiological benefits promote the formation of robust mats that, in turn, influence the formation of morphologically diverse microbialite structures that can be imprinted in the rock record.","[Kanik, Mert; Munro-Ehrlich, Mason; Fernandes-Martins, Maria Clara; Payne, Devon; Keller, Lisa; Lindsay, Melody R.; Colman, Daniel R.; Boyd, Eric S.] Montana State Univ, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Bozeman, MT 59717 USA; [Gianoulias, Kathryn; Kubacki, Alexander] Montana State Univ, Dept Hlth Sci, Bozeman, MT 59717 USA; [Baxter, Bonnie K.] Westminster Coll, Dept Biol, Great Salt Lake Inst, Salt Lake City, UT USA; [Vanden Berg, Michael D.] Utah Geol Survey, Salt Lake City, UT USA","Boyd, ES (corresponding author), Montana State Univ, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Bozeman, MT 59717 USA.",eboyd@montana.edu,,,W.M.

This listing now requires CITES parties to issue import and export permits and to closely monitor international trade in mako products. In this paper, three core arguments are being revisited that were uttered against a listing of the mako shark: that it is not scientifically justifiable; that it will cause implementation problems and will have limited conservation success; and that regional fisheries management organisations (RFMOs) are better suited to manage mako sharks. It is concluded that while the mako is not yet endangered globally, the precautionary approach justifies its listing. At the same time, although there will in all likelihood be implementation problems, the overall effect of the listing will be positive. Lastly, given their limited scope and focus on utilisation of economically valuable species, RFMOs are not well-suited for the conservation of mako sharks.","[Sellheim, Nikolas] Univ Helsinki, Helsinki Inst Sustainabil Sci HELSUS, POB 4, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland","Sellheim, N (corresponding author), Univ Helsinki, Helsinki Inst Sustainabil Sci HELSUS, POB 4, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland.",nikolas.sellheim@helsinki.fi,,,Maj and Tor Nessling Foundation [201800229],The work was supported by the Maj and Tor Nessling Foundation [grant number 201800229].,,30,0,0,0,0,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-597X,1872-9460,,MAR POLICY,Mar.

The most important taxa were the Carcharhinidae (requiem shark), Rhinopteridae (cownose rays), Sparoidea (Sparidae and Lethrinidae: sea breams and emperors) and Ariidae (sea catfishes). The results of the fish study show that the Suwayh lagoon must have gradually opened up to the sea and been populated with mangroves. The unique presence of so many sharks at this site seems to indicate that the inhabitants had a special interest in shark fishing and that their location was ideal for this specialised activity.

In this study, a hybrid optimization technique is presented for developing a high efficiency technique for the fusion of the medical images. The presented method uses both advantages of the wavelet transform and the homomorphic filter for improving the system efficiency. For achieving the optimal values of the system, a new optimization algorithm based on two new introduced methods, shark smell optimization algorithm and world cup optimization algorithm is introduced. The new algorithm is then applied to the wavelet part of the system to get the optimal values. Simulations are applied on two classes of five clinical images including MR-CT, MR-SPECT, and MR-PET the results are compared with six popular methods.

Based on their trophic habits, sharks and batoids occupy higher and medium trophic levels in the food webs, although differences in the trophic preferences exist between species. They are important organisms in marine ecosystems by maintaining the species below them in the food chain and serving as an indicator for ocean health. In comparison to sharks, batoids usually receive less research attention, with very little diet information available. This is true of the speckled ray (Raja polystigma), one of the three endemic batoids in Mediterranean waters. Here, by combining analyses of stomach contents and stable isotopes, we examined the trophic ecology (dietary composition and trophic position) of this ray in the north-western Mediterranean Sea. We also compared its trophic niche with the trophic position of other sympatric elasmobranchs present in same marine ecosystem. The results revealed that R. polystigma mainly consumes shrimps and to a lesser extent crabs, fin-fish, cephalopods, polychaetes and, surprisingly, small demersal sharks. We also found that R. polystigma shows similar trophic position to other crustacean-consumer elasmobranchs such rays and small demersal sharks.

During this process, cartilage cells (chondrocytes) mineralize the extracellular matrix and undergo apoptosis, giving way to bone cells (osteocytes). In contrast, sharks and rays (elasmobranchs) have cartilaginous skeletons throughout life, where only the surface mineralizes, forming a layer of tiles (tesserae). Elasmobranch chondrocytes, unlike those of other vertebrates, survive cartilage mineralization and are maintained alive in spaces (lacunae) within tesserae. However, the functions of the chondrocytes in the mineralized tissue remain unknown. Applying a custom analysis workflow to high-resolution synchrotron microCT scans of tesserae, we characterize the morphologies and arrangements of stingray chondrocyte lacunae, using lacunar morphology as a proxy for chondrocyte morphology. We show that the cell density is comparable in unmineralized and mineralized tissue and that cells maintain similar volume even when they have been incorporated into tesserae. Our findings support previous hypotheses that elasmobranch chondrocytes, unlike those of other taxa, do not proliferate, hypertrophy or undergo apoptosis during mineralization. Tessera lacunae show zonal variation in their shapes, being flatter further from and more spherical closer to the unmineralized cartilage matrix, and larger in the center of tesserae. The lacunae show pronounced organization into parallel layers and strong orientation toward neighboring tesserae. Tesserae also exhibit local variation in lacunar density, with the density considerably higher near pores passing through the tesseral layer, suggesting pores and cells interact, and that pores may contain a nutrient source. We propose that the different lacunar types reflect the stages of the tesserae formation process, while also representing local variation in tissue architecture and cell function. Lacunae are linked by small passages (canaliculi) in the matrix to form elongated series at the tesseral periphery and tight clusters in the center of tesserae, creating a rich connectivity among cells. The network arrangement and the shape variation of chondrocytes in tesserae indicate that cells may interact within and between tesserae and manage mineralization differently from chondrocytes in other vertebrates, perhaps performing analogous roles to osteocytes in bone.","[Chaumel, Julia; Fratzl, Peter; Dean, Mason N.] Max Planck Inst Colloids & Interfaces, Dept Biomat, Muhlenberg 1, D-14476 Potsdam, Germany; [Schotte, Merlind; Baum, Daniel] Zuse Inst Berlin, Visual Data Anal Dept, Takustr 7, D-14195 Berlin, Germany; [Bizzarro, Joseph J.] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Inst Marine Sci, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Zaslansky, Paul] Univ Med Berlin, Dept Operat & Prevent Dent, Amannshauser Str 4-6, D-14197 Berlin, Germany","Chaumel, J (corresponding author), Max Planck Inst Colloids & Interfaces, Dept Biomat, Muhlenberg 1, D-14476 Potsdam, Germany.",julia.chaumel@mpikg.mpg.de; schotte@zib.de; jbizzarr@ucsc.edu; paul.zaslansky@charite.de; Peter.Fratzl@mpikg.mpg.de; baum@zib.de; mason.dean@mpikg.mpg.de,"; Dean, Mason/C-8758-2014","zaslansky, paul/0000-0002-8714-4992; Dean, Mason/0000-0002-5026-6216",HFSP Young Investigator Grant [RGY0067-2013],"Helmholtz-Zentrum Berlin (HZB) allocated synchrotron radiation beamtime on BAMline.

Here, we aimed to investigate the reproductive biology of the narrowmouth catshark Schroederichthys bivius, an oviparous shark with size and secondary sexual dimorphism. For this purpose, specimens were collected during research surveys covering almost their entire distribution in the southwestern Atlantic continental shelf. Size distribution ranged from 196 to 810 mm total length (TL) in males and from 258 to 630 mm TL in females, and the mean size at maturity was 563 mm TL for males and 485 mm TL for females. Males appeared to be capable of mating all times of the year, while females could exhibit an annual reproductive cycle. Besides SSD, with males attaining higher maximum TL and size at maturity, spatial sexual segregation appears to be observed in mature specimens. Although differences in size at maturity were observed between surveys, these differences did not show a latitudinal pattern. The spatial overlap observed between closed areas to trawling and the distribution of egg-bearing females suggests that these closed areas, although designed and established to protect other species, may represent an important measure also for the conservation of S. bivius.","[Colonello, Jorge H.; Cortes, Federico; Belleggia, Mauro] Inst Nacl Invest & Desarrollo Pesquero INIDEP, Programa Pesquerias Condrictios, Paseo V Ocampo 1,B7602HSA, Mar Del Plata, Argentina; [Belleggia, Mauro] Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, Ave Rivadavia 1917,C1033AAJ, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina","Colonello, JH (corresponding author), Inst Nacl Invest & Desarrollo Pesquero INIDEP, Programa Pesquerias Condrictios, Paseo V Ocampo 1,B7602HSA, Mar Del Plata, Argentina.",jcolonello@inidep.edu.ar,,,,,,52,0,0,4,4,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0018-8158,1573-5117,,HYDROBIOLOGIA,Hydrobiologia,MAY,2020,847,8,,,,,1873,1886,,10.1007/s10750-020-04219-9,,,14,Marine & Freshwater Biology,Marine & Freshwater Biology,LG2JU,WOS:000527934500005,,,,,9/10/20

Pre-stress standard and routine metabolic rates (MR) of individuals of these species were measured and compared to the MR obtained after simulated gillnet capture. Standard MRs of M. antarcticus and H. portusjacksoni were 168.5 +/- 61.9 mgO(2) kg(-0.67) h(-1) and 144.1 +/- 20.4 mgO(2)kg(-0.67) h(-1) , respectively. Routine MRs of M. antarcticus and H. portusjacksoni were 202.6 +/- 63.5 mgO(2) kg(-0.67) h(-1) and 166.4 +/- 11.2 mgO(2) kg(-0.67) h(-1), respectively. The simulated gillnet-capture treatment decreased the MR of M. antarcticus by 59.3% and increased that of H. portusjacksoni by 21.6%. Our results confirm that M. antarcticus is highly sensitive to gillnet capture, exhibiting significant variability in MR among individuals and also a high delayed mortality rate. We interpret the decrease in MR as a compensatory mechanism for reducing oxygen consumption to cope with the stress imposed by capture. Mortality in this species was associated with higher pre-stress MR, and lower post-stress MR. In contrast, H. portusjacksoni showed mild increases in MR. Their resilience to capture stress most likely relies on effective buccal pumping and lower basal MR. A mixed-effects model approach permitted us to identify the main sources of variation in the MR measured, which were the individual differences, treatment effects, species variations and delayed mortality. The comparative approach employed in this work allowed us to understand and provide reliable estimates of the effects of fishing on the MRs of these two species.","[Manuel Molina, Juan] Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, Inst Argentino Oceanog, Bahia Blanca, Buenos Aires, Argentina; [Manuel Molina, Juan; Finotto, Licia; Ivan Walker, Terence; David Reina, Richard] Monash Univ, Sch Biol Sci, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia","Molina, JM (corresponding author), Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, Inst Argentino Oceanog, Bahia Blanca, Buenos Aires, Argentina.",jmmolina@criba.edu.ar,,,"Holsworth Wildlife Research Endowment & The Ecological Society of Australia; Australian Government Research Training Program (RTP) ScholarshipAustralian GovernmentDepartment of Industry, Innovation and Science; Australian Research CouncilAustralian Research Council [LP 110200572]; Endeavour research fellowship program","This work was funded by The Holsworth Wildlife Research Endowment & The Ecological Society of Australia and the Australian Government Research Training Program (RTP) Scholarship to Licia Finotto, by the Australian Research Council Linkage (grant number LP 110200572) to Richard David Reina and Terence Ivan Walker, and by the Endeavour research fellowship program to Juan Manuel Molina.

Endocrine aspects of the stress response are, however, poorly understood in elasmobranchs because of difficulties in measuring the primary glucocorticoid (1 alpha-hydroxycorticosterone). Here, we combined measures of plasma adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), the highly conserved pituitary hormone responsible for stimulating the release of adrenal/interrenal glucocorticoids, with measures of plasma lactate, osmolality, hematocrit, and behavior to gain a greater understanding of the capture stress response in Atlantic Sharpnose sharks, Rhizoprionodon terraenovae. Individuals were subject to a non-repeated measures blood sampling protocol in which blood samples were obtained following exposure to capture stress for < 3 min (designated baseline), and 15, 30, 45 and 60 min, after which behavior was categorized during release. Results revealed that ACTH was significantly higher at 15, 30, 45, and 60 min than at baseline. Lactate levels were highest at 45 and 60 min whereas osmolality and hematocrit did not differ significantly among the sampling periods. Lactate was the only variable to significantly predict the shark's behavior upon release with higher lactate levels correlating with sluggish behavior. Measurements of stress indicators are important in understanding the effects of capture on shark populations, which has been implicated in population declines.","[Fuller, Lauren; Leary, Christopher; Parsons, Glenn] Univ Mississippi, Dept Biol, 30 Univ Ave,POB 1848, University, MS 38677 USA; [Stell, Ehlana] Auburn Univ, Sch Fisheries Aquaculture & Aquat Sci, 201 Swingle Hall, Auburn, AL 36849 USA","Fuller, L (corresponding author), Univ Mississippi, Dept Biol, 30 Univ Ave,POB 1848, University, MS 38677 USA.",lfuller@go.olemiss.edu,,,"Walter F.

The discrete combination of hard and soft tissues is hypothesized to enhance the mechanical performance of tessellated cartilage (which performs many of the same functional roles as bone) by providing either rigidity or flexibility, depending on the nature of the applied load. These mechanisms and the effect of tesserae ultrastructure on cartilage mechanics, however, have never been demonstrated in the actual tissue, nor in bio-accurate models. Here, we develop bio-inspired three-dimensional tesserae computer models, incorporating material properties and ultrastructural features from natural tessellated cartilage. The geometries of ultrastructural features were varied parametrically, and the effective modulus of whole tesserae was evaluated using finite element analysis to determine the roles of ultrastructural features in mechanics. Whereas altering some structural features had no effect on the macroscopic in-plane modulus of tesserae, a three-fold increase in the contact surface area between two adjacent tesserae increased the effective modulus of tesserae by 6%. Modeled stress distributions suggest that tesseral 'spokes' (distinct hyper-mineralized features in tesserae) bear maximum stresses in the skeleton and serve to funnel stresses to particular populations of cells in tesserae, while spokes' lamellated structure likely helps dissipate crack energy, making tesserae more damage-tolerant. Simulations of multi-tesseral arrays showed that maximum stresses in tension and compression are borne by different tissues, supporting hypotheses of multi-functional properties of tessellated cartilage. Further, tesseral array models showed that minor alterations to tesserae/joint shape and/or material properties can be used to tune the mechanical behavior of the whole tiled composite. Our models provide the first functional understanding of the distinct morphologies of spokes and of 'stellate' tesserae (a tesseral shape observed first over 150 years ago), while also being useful drivers for hypotheses of growth, mechanics, load management, and the prevention and 'directing' of cracks in tessellated cartilage, as well as other biological composites. Additionally, these results establish guidelines and design principles for bio-inspired, tunable tiled materials. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","[Jayasankar, A.

The anatomical placement and operating temperatures of red muscle vary widely among teleosts: in tunas, the red muscle is located centrally in the body, adjacent to the spine, and maintains an elevated temperature. In the majority of ectothermic teleosts, red muscle is located laterally in the body, adjacent to the skin, and operates at ambient temperature. The specialized physiology and biomechanics of red muscle in tunas are often considered important adaptations to their high-performance pelagic lifestyle; however, the mechanics of how muscular work is transmitted to the tail remains largely unknown. The red muscle has a highly pennate architecture and is connected to the spine through a network of bones (epicentral bones) and long tendons (posterior oblique tendons). The network of long tendons has been hypothesized to enhance the power transmitted to the tail. Here, we investigate the morphology and biomechanics of the tuna's red muscle and tendons to determine whether elasticity is exploited to reduce the cost of transport, as is the case in many terrestrial vertebrates. To address this question, we evaluate two hypotheses: (1) tendons stretch during red-muscle-actuated swimming and (2) tendons comprise the primary load transmission pathway from the red muscle to the spine. To evaluate these hypotheses, we measured the mechanical properties of the posterior oblique tendons and performed novel dissections to estimate the peak force that the red muscle can generate. The force-generating capacity of the red muscle is calculated to be much greater than the load-bearing capacity of the posterior oblique tendons. Thus, the long tendons likely stretch under force from the red muscle, but they are not strong enough to be the primary force transmission pathway. These results suggest that other pathways, such as serial load transmission through the red muscle myomeres to the great lateral tendon and/or the anterior oblique tendons to the skin, transmit appreciable force to the tail.","[Lear, Melinda J.

The blue-shark, Prionace glauca (Linnaeus, 1758) is a viviparous placentary species in which the yolk sac develops during the pregnancy, turning into a placenta for matrotrophic nutrition of the embryo. The purpose of this study was to investigate the expression of IDO in the P. glauca maternal-fetal interface along three gestation phases and describe its distribution and the meaning of its presence. The results showed IDO labelling during the yolk sac/placenta development in the ectoderm on the three development phases and in the endoderm at the two first phases. In the uterine epithelium, IDO was observed in the last two phases. These interface tissues are major contact areas between the mother and the semiallogeneic conceptus and this relation could induce an immunological response against the fetus. Therefore, the presence of IDO may indicate that it could have a similar role in the mechanism of maternal-fetal tolerance in the P. glauca placental interface, as described in eutherian mammals.","[Salmon, Thierry; Bruno, Carlos Eduardo M.; Kfoury Junior, Jose Roberto] Univ Sao Paulo, Fac Vet Med & Anim Sci, Dept Surg, Sect Anat, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [de Amorim, Alberto Ferreira] SAA, Fisheries Inst, APTA Ctr Marine Fish, APTA, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil","Salmon, T (corresponding author), Univ Sao Paulo, Fac Vet Med & Anim Sci, Dept Surg, Sect Anat, Sao Paulo, Brazil.",salmonthierry@hotmail.com,"DE AMORIM, ALBERTO FERREIRA/H-1405-2012","Amorim, Alberto/0000-0002-1329-2634",CAPES (Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior)CAPES; FAPESPFundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP) [2016/05259-0],"We would like to thank to CAPES (Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior) for funding, FAPESP No 2016/05259-0 for the translation, Kowalski Pescados LTDA and all Marbella I crew and Instituto de Pesca.",,27,0,0,2,2,ACADEMIC PRESS LTD- ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,LONDON,"24-28 OVAL RD, LONDON NW1 7DX, ENGLAND",1050-4648,1095-9947,,FISH SHELLFISH IMMUN,Fish Shellfish Immunol.,MAY,2020,100,,,,,,256,260,,10.1016/j.fsi.2020.02.051,,,5,Fisheries; Immunology; Marine & Freshwater Biology; Veterinary Sciences,Fisheries; Immunology; Marine & Freshwater Biology; Veterinary Sciences,KZ9UF,WOS:000523603600028,32097719,,,,9/10/20

From January to November 2014, four SDL were deployed 24 h per day, four days per week to target bull (Carcharhinus leucas) and tiger (Galeocerdo cuvier) sharks and to test the fishing efficacy of the SDL. Presence and residence time of 19 acoustically tagged bull and 19 tiger sharks, which had been tagged up to two years before the SDL deployment, were modelled against different SDL configurations, which included bait type and presence of bait or catches on the hooks, as well as environmental parameters before, during and after SLD deployment. There was insufficient acoustic data from the tiger sharks for any analyses. Bull sharks spent less time in nearshore waters when drumlines were deployed, and their presence was influenced by sea surface temperatures (SST), rainfall and time of day. There was no difference in the number of bull sharks detected in the SDL deployment area compared with surrounding sites. As SDL catch rates were only poorly correlated with presence of tagged sharks, their efficacy in catching sharks present in the area could not be accurately determined. Overall, the results show that SDL, deployed without chum and baited with small, whole, low-fat fish cannot be considered as shark magnets, which could attract dangerous bull sharks inshore where they would pose a threat to the safety of surfers and other sea users. The detection of tagged bull sharks moving into and out of the SDL fishing area indicates that these fishing devices do not provide an impenetrable barrier to the passage of this potentially dangerous species.","[Guyomard, D.; Perry, C.] Ctr Securite Requin, 25F,Ave Artisans, F-97436 St Leu, Reunion Island, France; [Lee, K.

Our data from the viviparous red stingray (Hemitrygon akajei) reveals how viviparous elasmobranchs circumvent this issue. The exit of the embryonic intestine is maintained closed until close to birth, which allows the accumulation of faeces in the embryonic body. Faecal accumulation abilities are increased by (1) the large intestine size (represents about 400-600% of an adult intestine, proportionally), and (2) the modification in the intestinal inner wall structure, specialized to increase water uptake from the faecal matter. According to the literature, faecal accumulation may occur in embryos of the lamniform white shark as well. The reproductive biology of myliobatiform stingrays and lamniform sharks is characterized by the onset of oral feeding before birth (i.e. drinking of uterine milk and eating of sibling eggs, respectively), which is expected to result in the production of large amounts of faeces during gestation. The strong ability of faecal accumulation in these lineages is therefore likely an adaptation to their unique embryonic nutrition mechanism.","[Tomita, Taketeru; Nakamura, Masaru] Okinawa Churashima Res Ctr, Zool Lab, 888 Ishikawa,Motobu Cho, Motobu, Okinawa 9050206, Japan; [Tomita, Taketeru; Murakumo, Kiyomi] Okinawa Chiraumi Aquarium, 424 Ishikawa,Motobu Cho, Motobu, Okinawa 9050206, Japan; [Kobayashi, Yasuhisa] Okayama Univ, Ushimado Marine Inst, 130-17 Ushimado, Okayama 7014303, Japan; [Yoshinaka, Atsushi] Noboribetsu Marine Pk Nixe, Noboribetsu, Hokkaido 0590492, Japan","Tomita, T (corresponding author), Okinawa Churashima Res Ctr, Zool Lab, 888 Ishikawa,Motobu Cho, Motobu, Okinawa 9050206, Japan.; Tomita, T (corresponding author), Okinawa Chiraumi Aquarium, 424 Ishikawa,Motobu Cho, Motobu, Okinawa 9050206, Japan.",t-tomita@okichura.jp,,,,,,20,0,0,0,0,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",2045-2322,,,SCI REP-UK,Sci Rep,Apr-30,2020,10,1,,,,,,,7378,10.1038/s41598-020-64271-2,,,7,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,NA6UY,WOS:000559954900055,32355302,"DOAJ Gold, Green Published",,,9/10/20

Thus, abundance may not reflect contribution to adult populations, and contribution estimates require methods to identify the nursery origin of adults. We evaluated the use of natural tags, vertebral chemistry (stable isotope analysis, elemental analysis) and genetic markers, to identify bull shark Carcharhinus leucas nursery origin along the Texas coast (northwestern Gulf of Mexico) at multiple spatial scales. Sharks were most accurately assigned (89% accuracy) to their regional origin (Northern vs. Southern Texas) using a combination of vertebral chemistry and genetic markers. Accuracy decreased when incorporating only one type of natural tag (vertebral chemistry: 58%-84%; genetics: 30%-58%), or when assigning sharks among nurseries grouped into three or four regions (30%-71%; similar to 100 km spatial scale). Synthesis and applications. We describe a novel method integrating multiple natural tags to identify the nursery origin of a highly migratory coastal elasmobranch, over smaller spatial scales than previously investigated. This framework provides a powerful tool to estimate the relative source (nursery) contributions to adult populations of highly mobile species, which represent production estimates sought in the designation of essential fish habitat and ultimately incorporated into marine spatial planning practices.","[TinHan, Thomas C.; Rooker, Jay R.; Wells, R.

Successfully and non-destructively, addressing human-wildlife conflicts requires understanding of animal behavior. However, knowledge about white shark (Carcharodon carcharias) behavior near surf zones, where shark bites usually occur, is still limited. We used drones to obtain high-resolution tracks of 108 white sharks directly off coastal beaches on the east coast of Australia. White sharks ranged from 1.9 to 4.0 m (total length) and typically swam parallel to the beach line at an average speed of 0.82 m s(-1) (similar to 3.0 km h(-1)), with behavior being characteristic of energy conserving motion and foraging. Notably the presence of schools of fish increased mean swim speeds of sharks by 0.33 m s(-1) and caused tracks to be more convoluted. White sharks were also observed to swim straighter and faster with time either side of midday, increasing predicted mean swim speeds by 0.11 m s(-1), and net travel velocities by 0.25 m s(-1). White sharks also displayed inquisitive behavior toward various potential food and non-food items. We demonstrate that white sharks display largely predictable track trajectories and slow movement speeds along coastal beaches, which has utility in further developing non-destructive shark mitigation strategies. Whilst some of the behavior observed might support the exploratory bite hypothesis, there is likely an increased risk of a shark bite to bathers during situations where there are large shark-attracting food sources present.","[Colefax, Andrew P.; Kelaher, Brendan P.; Butcher, Paul A.] Southern Cross Univ, Natl Marine Sci Ctr, Coffs Harbour, NSW, Australia; [Pagendam, Daniel E.] CISRO, Dutton Pk, Qld, Australia; [Butcher, Paul A.] Natl Marine Sci Ctr, New South Wales Dept Primary Ind, Coffs Harbour, NSW, Australia","Colefax, AP (corresponding author), Southern Cross Univ, Natl Marine Sci Ctr, Coffs Harbour, NSW, Australia.",acolefax@scieye.com.au,"Butcher, Paul/T-4367-2019; Pagendam, Daniel E/B-1683-2010","Butcher, Paul/0000-0001-7338-6037; Pagendam, Daniel E/0000-0002-8347-4767","NSW DPI; associated NSW Shark Management Strategy, Southern Cross University; Paddy Pallin Foundation; Royal Zoological Society of NSW","Project funding and support was provided by the NSW DPI and associated NSW Shark Management Strategy, Southern Cross University, and the Paddy Pallin Foundation in partnership with the Royal Zoological Society of NSW.",,48,1,1,7,7,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,2296-7745,,FRONT MAR SCI,Front.

The high value marine tourism industry in Indonesia can create economic incentives for protecting and sustainably managing marine ecosystems and species, including sharks. This study estimates the economic value of shark and ray tourism in Indonesia and explores tourist preferences and local community perceptions of the tourism industry to understand the current and potential future role of this industry in shark and ray conservation. We identified 24 shark tourism hotspots across 14 provinces, with primary data collected from 365 tourists and 84 local community members over six case study sites. We use Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) and travel efforts to extrapolate expenditures to other tourism sites. We estimate that at least 188,931 dedicated or partially dedicated shark tourists visit Indonesia each year. The median annual expenditures of these shark tourists is estimated at USD 22 million (for 2017), accounting for at least 7% of the total USD 1 billion marine tourism revenue in Indonesia in 2017 and 1.45x the value of annual shark exports in the country (inflation-adjusted to 2017 values). If sharks were absent from the surveyed sites, Indonesia's tourism industry could lose similar to 25% of these dive tourist expenditures. Despite this considerable value, our study indicates a mismatch between the absolute economic value of shark and ray tourism and its role in providing an incentive for conservation. Results from interviews with local communities in or near shark and ray tourism sites indicate that shark fishers are not well placed to receive direct economic benefits from shark and ray tourism. Since overfishing is the primary threat to shark populations, failure to engage with and appropriately incentivize these stakeholders will be detrimental to the success of Indonesia's shark conservation efforts. If shark populations continue to decline due to insufficient conservation actions, the tourism industry could suffer economic losses from shark and ray tourism of more than USD 121 million per annum by 2027, as well as detrimental impacts on species, marine ecosystems, fisheries and people.","[Mustika, Putu Liza Kusuma] James Cook Univ, Coll Business Law & Governance, Townsville, Qld, Australia; [Mustika, Putu Liza Kusuma] Cetacean Sirenian Indonesia, Jakarta, Indonesia; [Ichsan, Muhammad; Booth, Hollie] Wildlife Conservat Soc Marine Program, Bogor, Indonesia; [Ichsan, Muhammad] Zool Soc London, EDGE Existence Programme, London, England; [Booth, Hollie] Univ Oxford, ICCS, Dept Zool, Oxford, England","Mustika, PLK (corresponding author), James Cook Univ, Coll Business Law & Governance, Townsville, Qld, Australia.; Mustika, PLK (corresponding author), Cetacean Sirenian Indonesia, Jakarta, Indonesia.",putuliza@gmail.com,,"Ichsan, Muhammad/0000-0002-8156-9666; Mustika, Putu/0000-0001-5157-4635",Walton Family Foundation [2016-1801]; MacArthur Family Foundation [16-1603-1150717],Funding to conduct the study was received from the Walton Family Foundation (grant number 2016-1801) and the MacArthur Family Foundation (grant number 16-1603-1150717).,,57,0,0,9,9,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,2296-7745,,FRONT MAR SCI,Front.

This means they need to know the number of animals being removed from a population and whether a given number of removals will lead to population increases or declines. For white shark (Carcharodon carcharias), theoretical quantities like the intrinsic rate of population increase or rebound potential (ability to increase in size following decline) are difficult to conceptualize in terms of real-world abundance changes, which limits our ability to answer practical management questions. To address this shortfall, we designed a simulation model to evaluate how our understanding of longevity and life history variability of white shark affects our understanding of population trends in the Northwest Atlantic. Then, we quantified the magnitude of removals that could have caused historical population declines, compared these to biologically based reference points, and explored the removal scenarios which would result in population increase. Our results suggest that removals on the order of 100s of juveniles per year could have resulted in population-level declines in excess of 60% during the 1970s and 1980s. Conservation actions implemented since the 1990s would have needed to be nearly 100% effective at preventing fishing mortality in order for the population to double in abundance over the last 30 years. Total removals from all fleets needed to be exceptionally small to keep them below biological reference points for white shark in the Northwest Atlantic. The population's inherent vulnerability to fishing pressure reaffirms the need for restrictive national and international conservation measures, even under a situation of abundance increase.","[Bowlby, Heather D.; Gibson, A.

Based on the analysis of two fishery-dependent sampling periods (1993-1994 and 2007-2014), this study aimed to determine reproductive parameters and identify temporal differences between the two time periods. In the first sampling period, 776 males and 352 females with a size range of 28.0-120.0 cm total stretched length (L-T) were analysed, and in the second sampling period, 387 males and 432 females with a size range of 28.0-122.0 cm L-T were analysed. The size at 50% maturity in the second sampling period was significantly different between sexes, 82.6 cm L-T for females and 73.8 cm L-T for males (no estimation was possible for the first sampling period). The size at 50% maternity was not different between sampling periods, 97.3 cm L-T for the first sampling period and 99.0 cm L-T for the second sampling period. Litter size varied from 3 to 19 embryos and the average was not statistically different in both periods, 10.1 (S.D. = 3.8) for the first sampling period and 11.3 (S.D. = 3.5) for the second sampling period. The female reproductive cycle is asynchronous, and it seems to be annual, with a gestation period of 5-6 months, and a consecutive ovarian cycle and gestation period. Temporal (between sampling periods) and latitudinal (southern Gulf versus northern regions) variations occur in the synchronicity of the reproductive cycle, temporal variation in the relationship between maternal length and litter size, and latitudinal variation in average size of mature sharks.","[Palacios-Hernandez, Daniela; Castillo-Geniz, Jose L.; Mendez-Loeza, Ivan; Perez-Jimenez, Juan C.] Colegio Frontera Sur, Lerma 24500, Campeche, Mexico","Perez-Jimenez, JC (corresponding author), Colegio Frontera Sur, Lerma 24500, Campeche, Mexico.",jcperez@ecosur.mx,,"Mendez-Loeza, Ivan/0000-0002-1700-9867; Perez-Jimenez, Juan Carlos/0000-0002-7258-1700; Castillo-Geniz, Jose Leonardo/0000-0002-8937-5671; Palacios Hernandez, Daniela/0000-0002-9025-448X",CONACyTConsejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT) [CB-2008-101997-Z]; Environmental Defence Fund (Oceans Program),Funding was provided by CONACyT (CB-2008-101997-Z) and the Environmental Defence Fund (Oceans Program).,,64,1,1,2,2,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-1112,1095-8649,,J FISH BIOL,J.

The mean length of the CV was 2.8% of total length (TL) whereas each LAV was 22.4% of TL and, when combined, was approximately 16 times longer than the CV. The mean tissue thickness overlying each LAV increased significantly (p < .001) with increasing TL and ranged from 3.5 to 33.8 mm in the smallest to largest shark. The mean internal diameter of the paired LAV also increased significantly (p < .001) with increasing TL and was equal to or exceeded the CV. Experienced SCUBA divers captured 56 free-living grey nurse sharks and 46 healthy animals were sampled for blood from the LAV and CV with minimal risk to the animals or staff. Venipuncture of the LAV (n = 16) was easily accomplished using ultrasound guidance with a 38 mm/18-gauge needle, whereas standard methods were used with the CV (n = 30). Serum biochemistry was compared (t-tests) and none of the biochemical analytes differed significantly between the LAV and CV. The paired LAV produced representative blood samples and could also be used for fluid therapy and/or intravenous anaesthesia as has been done in other sharks.

This species is currently ranked as vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature and the population trend may be decreasing globally. Tuna fisheries annually catch around 5 million tons worldwide but may have effects on the ecosystem, including impacts on certain sensitive non-target species. We provide the first insights into the environmental preferences of silky shark in the Atlantic Ocean by modelling their presence from tropical tuna purse seine observer data (-7500 fishing sets between 2003 and 2015) with a set of biotic and abiotic oceanographic factors, spatial-temporal terms and fishing operation variables. Oceanographic data (sea surface temperature, sea surface temperature change, salinity, sea surface height, chlorophyll-a, chlorophyll-a change, oxygen, and current information such as speed, direction and eddy kinetic energy) were downloaded and processed from the EU Copernicus Marine Environment Monitoring Service. Results provide information on the hotspots dynamics of silky shark as well as its habitat preferences. Models detected a significant relationship between seasonal upwelling events, mesoscale features and silky shark presence and suggested strong interaction between productive systems and the spatial-temporal distribution of the species. The model also highlighted both persistent (i.e. Gabon) and temporary areas (i.e. Guinea and southern-central tropical Atlantic Ocean) for silky shark in the region. This information could be used to assist tuna regional fisheries management organizations in the conservation and management of this vulnerable non-target species.","[Lopez, Jon] Interamer Trop Tuna Commiss, 8901 La Jolla Shores Dr, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Lopez, Jon; Murua, Hilario] AZTI, Portualdea Z-G, Pasaia 20110, Spain; [Alvarez-Berastegui, Diego] SOCIB, Edificio Norte Bloque A,Parc Bit, Palma De Mallorca 07122, Spain; [Soto, Maria] IEO, Ctr Oceanog Malaga, Puerto Pesquero S-N, Fuengirola 29640, Spain; [Murua, Hilario] ISSF, 1440 G St NW, Washington, DC 20005 USA","Lopez, J (corresponding author), Interamer Trop Tuna Commiss, 8901 La Jolla Shores Dr, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA.; Lopez, J (corresponding author), AZTI, Portualdea Z-G, Pasaia 20110, Spain.",jlopez@iattc.org,,"Lopez, Jon/0000-0002-4172-4094",,,,131,0,0,7,7,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0960-3115,1572-9710,,BIODIVERS CONSERV,Biodivers.

However, over the last several decades, the oceanic whitetip has experienced substantial population declines throughout its range due to fishing pressure and utilization in the international fin trade. In recent years, a significant amount of research has been undertaken on this species, revealing new information on life history, movements and behavior, and threats to the species. Additionally, a recent surge of protective measures has been implemented for the oceanic whitetip shark, both internationally and nationally. These include (but are not limited to) retention prohibition measures in every major tuna Regional Fishery Management Organization (RFMO), its listing in Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Flora and Fauna (CITES), and its listing under the U.S. Endangered Species Act (ESA) as a threatened species. However, despite its global distribution and common occurrence in many commercial fisheries in tropical waters, little is still known regarding the oceanic whitetip shark's biology and population status. Therefore, we summarize what is known on the biology and conservation of the oceanic whitetip shark, identify information gaps, and discuss future directions for recovery of this imperiled species.","[Young, Chelsey N.] NOAA, Fisheries Serv, Off Protected Resources, 1315 East West Highway, Silver Spring, MD 20910 USA; [Young, Chelsey N.] NOAA, Fisheries Serv, Pacific Isl Reg Off, 1845 Wasp Blvd, Honolulu, HI 96815 USA; [Carlson, John K.] NOAA, Fisheries Serv, Southeast Fisheries Sci Ctr, Panama City Lab, 3500 Delwood Beach Rd, Panama City, FL 32408 USA","Carlson, JK (corresponding author), NOAA, Fisheries Serv, Southeast Fisheries Sci Ctr, Panama City Lab, 3500 Delwood Beach Rd, Panama City, FL 32408 USA.",john.carlson@noaa.gov,,,,,,110,3,3,8,8,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0960-3166,1573-5184,,REV FISH BIOL FISHER,Rev.

In Peru, the northern coast has been identified as the area with the highest presence of whale sharks, yet their ecology in this area is poorly defined. This study predicts the spatial distribution of whale sharks off coastal northern Peru (03 degrees 00 ' S-04 degrees 30 ' S) during La Nina and El Nino seasonal conditions, utilizing maximum entropy modelling. Between 2009 and 2018 (except for 2011), 347 whale sharks were geo-referenced in northern Peru with greatest data recordings in the austral summer and spring during La Nina events. Depth was the most important predictive variable for spatial distribution of whale sharks, followed by chlorophyll-a. Sharks were predicted in shallower coastal waters in which chlorophyll-a values are higher. Habitat suitability was higher in the northern coastal part of the study area. Spring presents the most suitable environmental conditions for whale sharks, both during La Nina and El Nino conditions. The probability of whale shark presence in the north of Peru increases at higher chlorophyll-a and sea surface temperature values. Therefore, whale sharks appear to aggregate seasonally in northern Peru, potentially exploiting rich foraging grounds. In these areas of high suitability, whale sharks are susceptible to fisheries, bycatch, ship collisions, unmanaged tourism, and pollution; thus, management actions should focus in these areas. This study represents a first step to understand the distribution and habitat suitability of whale shark in Peruvian waters. Further studies should identify suitable habitat for whale sharks in offshore areas. Also, these should focus on the connectivity of these aggregations with other localities in the south-eastern Pacific in order to contribute to regional strategies for the conservation of this iconic species in this particular region.","[Gonzalez-Pestana, Adriana] James Cook Univ, Townsville, Qld, Australia; [Maguino, Rossana; Mendoza, Alejandra; Kelez, Shaleyla] ecOceanica, San Borja, Peru; [Ramirez-Macias, Deni] Conciencia Mexico Whale Shark Mexico, Mexico City, DF, Mexico","Gonzalez-Pestana, A (corresponding author), James Cook Univ, Townsville, Qld, Australia.",adriana@conciencia.org.pe,,"Gonzalez Pestana, Adriana/0000-0001-9510-3966; Kelez, Shaleyla/0000-0003-3296-8721",World Wildlife Fund [SW91],"World Wildlife Fund, Grant/Award Number: SW91",,101,1,1,10,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1052-7613,1099-0755,,AQUAT CONSERV,Aquat.

The objective of this study was to assess the extinction risk of all 10 wedgefishes and six giant guitarfishes by applying the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List Categories and Criteria, and to summarize the latest understanding of their biogeography and habitat, life history, exploitation, use and trade, and population status. Three of the 10 wedgefish species had not been assessed previously for the IUCN Red List. Wedgefishes and giant guitarfishes have overtaken sawfishes as the most imperilled marine fish families globally, with all but one of the 16 species facing an extremely high risk of extinction through a combination of traits: limited biological productivity; presence in shallow waters overlapping with some of the most intense and increasing coastal fisheries in the world; and overexploitation in target and by-catch fisheries, driven by the need for animal protein and food security in coastal communities and the trade in meat and high-value fins. Two species with very restricted ranges, the clown wedgefish (Rhynchobatus cooki) of the Malay Archipelago and the false shark ray (Rhynchorhina mauritaniensis) of Mauritania, may be very close to extinction. Only the eyebrow wedgefish (Rhynchobatus palpebratus) is not assessed as Critically Endangered, with it occurring primarily in Australia where fishing pressure is low and some management measures are in place. Australia represents a 'lifeboat' for the three wedgefish and one giant guitarfish species occurring there. To conserve populations and permit recovery, a suite of measures will be required that will need to include species protection, spatial management, by-catch mitigation, and harvest and international trade management, all of which will be dependent on effective enforcement.","[Kyne, Peter M.] Charles Darwin Univ, Res Inst Environm & Livelihoods, Darwin, NT, Australia; [Jabado, Rima W.] Elasmo Project, Dubai, U Arab Emirates; [Rigby, Cassandra L.; Simpfendorfer, Colin A.] James Cook Univ, Ctr Sustainable Trop Fisheries & Aquaculture, Townsville, Qld, Australia; [Rigby, Cassandra L.; Simpfendorfer, Colin A.] James Cook Univ, Coll Sci & Engn, Townsville, Qld, Australia; [Dharmadi] Minist Marine Affairs & Fisheries, Ctr Fisheries Res, Jakarta, Indonesia; [Gore, Mauvis A.] Marine Conservat Int, South Queensferry, Scotland; [Pollock, Caroline M.] Int Union Conservat Nat IUCN Global Species Progr, Red List Unit, Cambridge, England; [Herman, Katelyn B.] Georgia Aquarium, Atlanta, GA USA; [Cheok, Jessica; Dulvy, Nicholas K.] Simon Fraser Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Earth Ocean Res Grp, Burnaby, BC, Canada; [Ebert, David A.] Moss Landing Marine Labs, Pacific Shark Res Ctr, Pob 450, Moss Landing, CA 95039 USA; [Ebert, David A.] South African Inst Aquat Biodivers, Grahamstown, South Africa","Kyne, PM (corresponding author), Charles Darwin Univ, Res Inst Environm & Livelihoods, Darwin, NT, Australia.",peter.kyne@cdu.edu.au,,"Kyne, Peter/0000-0003-4494-2625; Rigby, Cassandra/0000-0003-4771-8514",Canada Research Chairs ProgramCanada Research Chairs; Darwin Initiative; National Environment Science Program Marine Biodiversity Hub; Natural Science and Engineering Research CouncilNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; Save Our Seas Foundation; Shark Conservation Fund; Australian Government's National Environmental Science ProgrammeAustralian Government; Marine Biodiversity Hub; South African Institute for Aquatic BiodiversityNational Research Foundation - South Africa,"Canada Research Chairs Program; Darwin Initiative; National Environment Science Program Marine Biodiversity Hub; Natural Science and Engineering Research Council Discovery and Accelerator Awards; Save Our Seas Foundation; Shark Conservation Fund, Grant/Award Number: Global Shark Trends Project; South African Institute for Aquatic Biodiversity; Australian Government's National Environmental Science Programme; Marine Biodiversity Hub",,117,0,0,12,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1052-7613,1099-0755,,AQUAT CONSERV,Aquat.

In contrast, the calcified vertebral centra of elasmobranchs (sharks, skates and rays) yield important information about ecological and biological traits that can be utilized for constructing age-structured population dynamic models of extant species and palaeoecological reconstructions of such aspects in extinct groups. Here, we describe two large shark vertebrae from the Santonian (Upper Cretaceous) of Spain, which show a unique combination of characters (asterospondylic calcification pattern, with concentric lamellae and numerous parallel bands that are oriented perpendicular) that is only known from ptychodontid sharks, a distinct, extinct group of giant durophagous sharks of the Cretaceous era. Based on linear regression models for large extant sharks a total length between 430 and 707cm was estimated for the examined specimen. Our results indicate that ptychodontid sharks were large viviparous animals, with slow growth rates, matured very late and, therefore, show typical traits for K-selected species. These traits combined with a highly specialized feeding ecology might have played a crucial role for the success but also, eventually, extinction of this group.","[Jambura, Patrick L.; Kriwet, Juergen] Univ Vienna, Dept Palaeontol, Vienna, Austria","Jambura, PL (corresponding author), Univ Vienna, Dept Palaeontol, Vienna, Austria.",patrick.jambura@gmail.com,,"Jambura, Patrick/0000-0002-4765-5042; Kriwet, Jurgen/0000-0002-6439-8455",University of Vienna,"The authors received no specific funding for this work.

This paucity of information impedes management and conservation planning for these taxa. Using vertebral increment patterning as a proxy of somatic growth, this study reconstructed mean growth of the philopatric and demersal Heterodontus portusjacksoni population from Gulf St Vincent (South Australia). A biochronology of shark growth spanning a 15 year period (1996-2010) was developed using mixed effects models. The biochronology showed considerable year-to-year deviations in growth that were significantly and negatively correlated with mean sea surface temperatures during the species' breeding season (July to November). These findings are consistent with mesocosm experiments and support the influence of changing climates on shark growth; particularly in an inshore, demersal, and highly philopatric shark species. It is likely that the effects of environmental variation occur in a species-specific manner, governed by life history strategies and ecological requirements. In this manner, life history traits might aid in estimating species vulnerability to climate change.","[Izzo, Christopher] Univ Adelaide, Sch Biol Sci, Southern Seas Ecol Labs, Adelaide, SA, Australia; Univ Adelaide, Sch Biol Sci, Environm Inst, Adelaide, SA, Australia; [Izzo, Christopher] Fisheries Res & Dev Corp, Adelaide, SA, Australia","Izzo, C (corresponding author), Univ Adelaide, Sch Biol Sci, Southern Seas Ecol Labs, Adelaide, SA, Australia.; Izzo, C (corresponding author), Fisheries Res & Dev Corp, Adelaide, SA, Australia.",christopher.izzo@frdc.com.au,,,Sea World Research and Rescue Foundation Inc.

As part of the decommissioning process, studies on potential importance of subsea infrastructure to marine megafauna (defined as: cetaceans, pinnipeds, sirenians, large fish - such as sharks, rays, billfishes, and tuna, as well as marine reptiles, and seabirds) are lacking. Dedicated scientific Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) surveys around offshore installations are rare, but there is a wealth of archived industrial data and noteworthy species sightings posted publicly on various social media platforms. This study used routine, incidentally collected ROV (n = 73) and commercial diver (n = 9) video recordings spanning 1998-2019 globally. Data were gathered directly from industrial partners (n = 36) and the public domain (YouTube; n = 46) to provide an account of marine megafauna presence and potential feeding behavior in the near-visible vicinity of subsea anthropogenic structures. A total of 79 video clips and 3 still images of marine megafauna near offshore structures were examined, resulting in 67 individual sightings and 16 sub-sightings (in which an individual was recorded within the same day). At least 178 individuals were identified to a minimum of 17 species of marine megafauna, amounting to a total (combined) sighting duration of 01:09:35 (hh:mm:ss). Results demonstrated proximate presence of marine megafauna (many of which are threatened species) to anthropogenic structures, with most animals displaying foraging or interaction behaviors with the structures. Observations included the deepest (2,779 m) confirmed record of a sleeper shark (Somniosus spp.) and the first confirmed visual evidence of seals following pipelines. These ROV observations demonstrate a latent source of easily accessible information that can expand understanding of marine megafauna interactions with offshore anthropogenic infrastructure. Consequently, other workers in this field should be encouraged to re-analyze archived datasets, commence further collaborative research projects with industrial partners, and/or expand Internet search terms to additional species assemblages, in a bid to quantitatively elucidate relationships between offshore infrastructure and marine species.","[Todd, Victoria L.

The purpose of this paper is to determine to what extent, and under what circumstances, emotional appeals may be effective to convince the conversational partner in entrepreneurship discourse. Design/methodology/approach To examine the interaction between rational and emotional appeals this paper analyses a corpus formed by several examples of the elevator pitch genre, which have been taken from a TV programme called Tu Oportunidad (Your Chance), the Spanish counterpart of the British Dragon's Den and the American Shark Tank. Using the information gathered in the discursive analysis of the corpus, the paper establishes a template that identifies the main rational and emotional aspects that characterize the entrepreneurial pitch. In a second stage of the research, the template is used to conduct a quantitative analysis of the persuasive influence of rational and emotional aspects. Findings The results of the qualitative and quantitative research show that there is a clear correlation between the propensity to finance entrepreneurial ventures and the presence of rational aspects in the entrepreneurial pitch. The lack of rational arguments determines the failure of the entrepreneur's efforts to be persuasive, regardless of the emotional appeals that are introduced into the pitch. Emotional appeals prove to be useful to reinforce rational arguments but they are not sufficiently persuasive on their own. Originality/value The paper offers insight into the criteria that investors take into account in order to evaluate entrepreneurial projects, as well as on the strategies that entrepreneurs should develop to build a successful business pitch.","[Fernandez-Vazquez, Jose-Santiago] Univ Alcala De Henares, Dept Modern Philol, Alcala De Henares, Spain; [Alvarez-Delgado, Roberto-Carlos] Univ Alcala De Henares, Dept Philol Commun & Documentat Studies, Alcala De Henares, Spain","Fern?ndez-V?zquez, JS (corresponding author), Univ Alcala De Henares, Dept Modern Philol, Alcala De Henares, Spain.",jsantiago.fernandez@uah.es,,,,,,58,0,0,7,7,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1355-2554,1758-6534,,INT J ENTREP BEHAV R,Int.

We tested a genetic stock identification (GSI) workflow to quantify the relative contributions of different source populations of the CITES-listed scalloped hammerhead shark Sphyrna lewini to international trade hubs for products such as dried fins. We grouped published mitochondrial control region sequences from wild-captured sharks sampled in 15 locations into 9 differentiated populations that provide broad coverage of the species global distribution. GSI simulations established that these populations are highly identifiable and we trialed this approach to assess the provenance of processed fin trimmings collected randomly from the retail market of Hong Kong, one of the world's largest shark fin trade hubs in 2014-2015 (N = 72). In this pilot survey, we found over 75% of scalloped hammerhead fin trimmings came from two Pacific Ocean populations, but mostly from the Eastern Pacific (61.4%, of all trimmings; se 7.1%) where this species is listed as 'Endangered' under the United States Endangered Species Act. Six of the nine populations were found in this sample of the market, indicating near global sourcing of scalloped hammerhead fins in Hong Kong. We suggest technical and sampling considerations for employing GSI at fin trade hubs in the future to investigate regional sourcing of scalloped hammerheads and other coastal sharks in international trade. Random GSI in trade hubs could revolutionize our understanding of global shark trade dynamics and provide critical information required to effectively implement shark fisheries management and trade restrictions.","[Fields, A.

Specimens comprised whole worms and free proglottids, both of varying degrees of maturity. This material allowed for the opportunity to examine in detail the developmental progression of this hyperapolytic lecanicephalidean species with regard to overall size, scolex dimensions, and microthrix pattern. Complete immature worms ranged in size from 2.4 nun to 14mm. The smallest scoleces were half as wide as larger scoleces and exhibited a much smaller ratio of apical organ width to bothridial width. Proglottids more than quadrupled in length during maturation from terminal attached immature to detached proglottids. In addition, a change in microthrix pattern was observed on the anterior region of the proglottids from immature to gravid proglottids; the anterior region of attached immature proglottids is covered with gladiate to coniform spinitriches with capilliform filitriches only rarely visible, whereas this region in detached proglottids is covered with gladiate to coniform spinitriches and conspicuous capilliform filitriches. This is the first report of A. japonica from outside Japan expanding its distribution south to Taiwan. In addition, a preliminary phylogenetic analysis of the genus is presented that suggests congeners from the same host species are not each other's closest relatives, nor is there an apparent phylogenetic signal for apical organ type or reproductive strategy (apolysis). However, reproductive strategy does seem to be correlated with host group such that euapolytic species parasitise dasyatid stingrays while hyperapolytic species parasitise either torpediniform rays or orectolobiform sharks.","[Guyer, Rachel R.; Jensen, Kirsten] Univ Kansas, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, 1200 Sunnyside Ave, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA; [Guyer, Rachel R.; Jensen, Kirsten] Univ Kansas, Biodivers Inst, 1200 Sunnyside Ave, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA; [Guyer, Rachel R.] Univ Tennessee, Dept Entomol & Plant Pathol, Jackson, TN USA","Jensen, K (corresponding author), Univ Kansas, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, 1200 Sunnyside Ave, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA.; Jensen, K (corresponding author), Univ Kansas, Biodivers Inst, 1200 Sunnyside Ave, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA.",jensen@ku.edu,,", Kirsten/0000-0003-0294-8471","NSF DEB award [0818696, 0818823]; DEB [1921404, 1921411]","We are grateful to Janine N.

This algorithm is widely applied in different fields of water resources problems. This paper presents a comprehensive overview of the basic PSO algorithm search strategy and PSO's applications and performance analysis in water resources engineering optimization problems. Our literature review revealed 22 different varieties of the PSO algorithm. The characteristics of each PSO variety together with their applications in different fields of water resources engineering (e.g., reservoir operation, rainfall-runoff modeling, water quality modeling, and groundwater modeling) are highlighted. The performances of different PSO variants were compared with other evolutionary algorithms (EAs) and mathematical optimization methods. The review evaluates the capability and comparative performance of PSO variants over conventional EAs (e.g., simulated annealing, differential evolution, genetic algorithm, and shark algorithm) and mathematical methods (e.g., support vector machine and differential dynamic programming) in terms of proper convergence to optimal Pareto fronts, faster convergence rate, and diversity of computed solutions.","[Jahandideh-Tehrani, Mahsa] Griffith Univ, Sch Engn & Built Environm, Gold Coast, Qld, Australia; [Bozorg-Haddad, Omid] Univ Tehran, Fac Agr Engn & Technol, Dept Irrigat & Reclamat Engn, Coll Agr & Nat Resources, Tehran, Iran; [Loaiciga, Hugo A.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Geog, Santa Barbara, CA 93016 USA","Bozorg-Haddad, O (corresponding author), Univ Tehran, Fac Agr Engn & Technol, Dept Irrigat & Reclamat Engn, Coll Agr & Nat Resources, Tehran, Iran.",mahsa.jahandideh-tehrani@griffithuni.edu.au; OBHaddad@ut.ac.ir; Hugo.Loaiciga@geog.ucsb.edu,"Tehrani, Mahsa Jahandideh/L-4847-2019","Tehrani, Mahsa Jahandideh/0000-0003-1763-2023",Iran's National Science Foundation (INSF),The authors thank Iran's National Science Foundation (INSF) for its financial support of this research.,,123,0,0,6,6,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0167-6369,1573-2959,,ENVIRON MONIT ASSESS,Environ.

This formation is composed of sands, silts and clays and is divided into the Potapaco and Woodstock members. Remains of fishes, reptiles, birds, mammals, molluscs, fruits and seeds are common in the Potapaco Member, in addition to vertebrate coprolites. Here, we present an analysis of more than 2000 coprolites from the Fisher/Sullivan Site in Virginia. The chemical composition (phosphatic) and the type of inclusions (fish bones) indicate that only scats of carnivorous animals were preserved. The analysed specimens were grouped into six morphotypes: (1) the cylindrical morphotype is a cylinder with rounded ends; (2) the segmented morphotype is a cylinder segmented with rounded ends, and occasionally one end is concave; (3) the oval morphotype represents a bean-shaped coprolite; (4) the scroll morphotype is cylindrical to conical in lateral view and has coils seen only at the ends; (5) the folded morphotype is a spiral that is concentrically folded; and (6) the sinuous morphotype is serpentine, with rounded ends. Coprophagy-related scrape traces occur in different morphotypes and represent both invertebrate burrows and bite traces made by fishes. The mineralogical and chemical analyses indicate an early precipitation of phosphate and pyrite minerals, probably induced by the microbial community. All coprolites at the Fisher/Sullivan Site were produced by fishes: carcharhiniform sharks for the scroll morphotype and lamniform sharks, probably the genus Carcharias, for the folded morphotype; the oval, cylindrical and segmented morphotypes were likely produced by actinopterygian fishes.","[Dentzien-Dias, Paula] Univ Fed Rio Grande, Inst Oceanog, Lab Geol & Paleontol, Ave Italia Km 8, BR-96203900 Rio Grande, RS, Brazil; [Dentzien-Dias, Paula] Univ Fed Rio Grande, Inst Oceanog, Programa Posgrad Oceanol, Ave Italia Km 8, BR-96203900 Rio Grande, RS, Brazil; [Hunt, Adrian P.] Flying Heritage & Combat Armor Museum, 3407 109th St SW, Everett, WA 98204 USA; [Lucas, Spencer G.] New Mexico Museum Nat Hist & Sci, 1801 Mt Rd NW, Albuquerque, NM 87104 USA; [Francischini, Heitor] Univ Fed Rio Grande do Sul, Inst Geociencias, Dept Paleontol & Estratig, Lab Paleontol Vertebrados, Ave Bento Goncalves 9500,15001, BR-91501970 Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil; [Gulotta, Marco] 54546 Whispering Woods Lane, King George, VA 22485 USA","Dentzien-Dias, P (corresponding author), Univ Fed Rio Grande, Inst Oceanog, Lab Geol & Paleontol, Ave Italia Km 8, BR-96203900 Rio Grande, RS, Brazil.; Dentzien-Dias, P (corresponding author), Univ Fed Rio Grande, Inst Oceanog, Programa Posgrad Oceanol, Ave Italia Km 8, BR-96203900 Rio Grande, RS, Brazil.",pauladentzien@gmail.com; adrianhu@flyingheritage.org; spencer.lucas@state.nm.us; heitorfrancischini@hotmail.com; mgulotta@wildblue.net,"Francischini, Heitor/AAN-7490-2020","Francischini, Heitor/0000-0001-9809-7784","Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico [CNPq]National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq) [140581/2014-6, 409750/2016-6, 302936/2018-1]; Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior [CAPES]CAPES [88881.133764/2016-01]","We thank the CEME-Sul (FURG) team that helped with the SEM and EDS analyses and the LRX (UFRGS) for the X-ray analysis.

Measurements of retinal spectral sensitivity in juvenile sharks, made using single flash and heterochromatic flicker photometry under conditions of dark- or light-adaptation, indicated a peak sensitivity at around 500 nm, with no evidence of a spectral shift with increasing levels of light adaptation. Histological sections of the retina revealed a heavily rod dominated retina containing only a few small cell profiles in the photoreceptor layer that might represent a sparse cone population or may be immature rods. Assessment of retinal topography in juvenile sharks indicated the presence of a distinct specialisation for increased visual spatial acuity in the form of a horizontal streak of higher rod photoreceptor (similar to 80,000 rods mm(-2)) and ganglion cell (similar to 1,800 cells mm(-2)) densities across the horizontal meridian of the eye. This specialization would be adaptive for panoramic sampling of the part of the visual field corresponding to the substrate-water interface and remove the need for H. portusjacksoni to move its eyes extensively when resting on the sea floor. The estimated upper limit of spatial resolving power in juvenile H. portusjacksoni was 3.14 cycles deg(-1), which is at the lower end of values measured in elasmobranchs. Taken together, these results suggest that the retina of H. portusjacksoni is well adapted for nocturnal vision.","[Peel, Lauren R.; Collin, Shaun P.; Hart, Nathan S.] Univ Western Australia, Sch Biol Sci, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia; [Peel, Lauren R.; Collin, Shaun P.] Univ Western Australia, Oceans Inst, Crawley, WA, Australia; [Peel, Lauren R.; Collin, Shaun P.] Univ Western Australia, Oceans Grad Sch, Crawley, WA, Australia; [Collin, Shaun P.] La Trobe Univ, Sch Life Sci, Bundoora, Vic, Australia; [Hart, Nathan S.] Macquarie Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Sydney, NSW, Australia","Hart, NS (corresponding author), Univ Western Australia, Sch Biol Sci, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia.",nathan.hart@mq.edu.au,"Hart, Nathan S/B-8564-2011","Hart, Nathan S/0000-0002-7289-9399; Peel, Lauren/0000-0001-6960-5663","Australian Research CouncilAustralian Research Council [DP0558681, LP160100333]; Sea World Research and Rescue Foundation","Australian Research Council, Grant/Award Numbers: DP0558681, LP160100333; Sea World Research and Rescue Foundation",,75,0,0,5,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9967,1096-9861,,J COMP NEUROL,J.

Previous studies have focused on offshore reefs and atolls with little information available on the movement and space use of sharks utilising reef habitats closer to shore. Cross-shelf differences in physical and biological properties of reefs can alter regional ecosystem processes resulting in different movement patterns for resident sharks. Passive acoustic telemetry was used to examine residency, space use and depth use of 40 blacktip reef sharks, Carcharhinus melanopterus, on an inshore reef in Queensland, Australia, and assess temporal or biological influences. All sharks showed strong site-attachment to inshore reefs with residency highest among adult females. Sharks exhibited a sex-based, seasonal pattern in space use where males moved more, occupied more space and explored new areas during the reproductive season, while females utilised the same amount of space throughout the year, but shifted the location of the space used. A positive relationship was also observed between space use and size. There was evidence of seasonal site fidelity and long-distance movement with the coordinated, annual migration of two adult males to the study site during the mating season. Depth use was segregated with some small sharks occupying shallower depths than adults throughout the day and year, most likely as refuge from predation. Results highlight the importance of inshore reef habitats to blacktip reef sharks and provide evidence of connectivity with offshore reefs, at least for adult males.","[Schlaff, Audrey M.; Heupel, Michelle R.; Simpfendorfer, Colin A.] James Cook Univ, Ctr Sustainable Trop Fisheries & Aquaculture, Townsville, Qld, Australia; [Schlaff, Audrey M.; Heupel, Michelle R.; Simpfendorfer, Colin A.] James Cook Univ, Coll Sci & Engn, Townsville, Qld, Australia; [Heupel, Michelle R.] Univ Tasmania, Integrated Marine Observing Syst, Hobart, Tas, Australia; [Udyawer, Vinay] Australian Inst Marine Sci, Townsville, Qld, Australia","Schlaff, AM (corresponding author), James Cook Univ, Ctr Sustainable Trop Fisheries & Aquaculture, Townsville, Qld, Australia.; Schlaff, AM (corresponding author), James Cook Univ, Coll Sci & Engn, Townsville, Qld, Australia.",audrey.schlaff@my.jcu.edu.au,,"Schlaff, Audrey/0000-0002-2650-5969",Australian Government's National Environmental Research Program (Tropical Ecosystems Hub)Australian Government [6.1],"Funding for this research was provided by the Australian Government's National Environmental Research Program (Tropical Ecosystems Hub) [Project 6.1] awarded to MRH and CAS.

The six hypothesized mood profiles (i.e., iceberg, inverse Everest, inverse iceberg, shark fin, submerged, and surface profiles) were identified clearly. Chi-squared analyses showed unequal distribution of the profiles by gender, age group, ethnicity, education level, and sport participation.

This research also identifies some structural problems related to micro-financing and provides workable solutions. Design/methodology/approach This research uses the entrepreneurial network model of Schutjens and Stam (2003) to examine how Indonesian micro and small enterprises (MSEs) evolve even before they become regular small businesses. Content analysis is used on 10 micro-enterprises from Jakarta, the capital city of Indonesia and its surroundings. Financing issues at each stage of enterprise development are identified and deeply examined. Findings This research not only confirms the significant financing problems micro-enterprises face but also clarifies that these problems are unique to each stage of the MSEs' development. One insight is that most micro-enterprises do not use funding from formal institutions. That is, business owners rely more on funding from non-formal institutions. This is because these enterprises' managers generally cannot prepare loans application and/or they are lack of knowledge/training on financing matters.

Such displays are known to facilitate mate attraction or signal relationship quality. Across many taxa, synchronous male displays appear to be driven by competition, while synchronous displays in humans are thought to be unique in that they serve a cooperative function. Indeed, it is well established that human synchrony promotes cooperative endeavours and increases success in joint action tasks. We examine another system in which synchrony is tightly linked to cooperative behaviour. Male bottlenose dolphins form long-lasting, multi-level, cooperative alliances in which they engage in coordinated efforts to coerce single oestrus females. Previous work has revealed the importance of motor synchrony in dolphin alliance behaviour. Here, we demonstrate that allied dolphins also engage in acoustic coordination whereby males will actively match the tempo and, in some cases, synchronize the production of their threat vocalization when coercing females. This finding demonstrates that male dolphins are capable of acoustic coordination in a cooperative context and, moreover, suggests that both motor and acoustic coordination are features of coalitionary behaviour that are not limited to humans.","[Moore, Bronte L.; Allen, Simon J.; King, Stephanie L.] Univ Western Australia, Sch Biol Sci, Crawley, WA, Australia; [Connor, Richard C.] Univ Massachusetts Dartmouth, Biol Dept, N Dartmouth, MA USA; [Allen, Simon J.; King, Stephanie L.] Univ Bristol, Sch Biol Sci, Bristol BS8 1TQ, Avon, England; [Allen, Simon J.; Krutzen, Michael] Univ Zurich, Dept Anthropol, Zurich, Switzerland","King, SL (corresponding author), Univ Western Australia, Sch Biol Sci, Crawley, WA, Australia.; King, SL (corresponding author), Univ Bristol, Sch Biol Sci, Bristol BS8 1TQ, Avon, England.",stephanie.king@bristol.ac.uk,"King, Stephanie/B-7229-2015","King, Stephanie/0000-0003-2293-9185",Branco Weiss FellowshipSociety in Science; National Geographic SocietyNational Geographic Society [050R-17]; Swiss National Science FoundationSwiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) [31003A_149956],S.L.K. was supported by the Branco Weiss FellowshipSociety in Science.

Information about its movements and habitat use is fragmentary and recent study showed that elemental signatures deposited in its vertebrae served as reliable site-specific markers. Age-related movements of S. lewini in the Mexican Pacific were examined using vertebral microchemistry. Vertebrae were obtained from 48 sharks captured in 2016. Elemental signatures were quantified using laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Spatial variability of the vertebral edge elemental signatures was first assessed to verify that microchemistry could distinguish among sharks based on recent habitat use before inferences on environmental histories could be made. Age-related movements were then assessed by quantifying changes in the Sr:Ca, Ba:Ca, Sr:Ba and Pb:Ca ratios along vertebral transects encompassing complete life histories. Analysis of elemental profiles suggested that S. lewini exhibits movements that are likely more plastic than previously assumed, with a stronger association to coastal habitats than expected. Females used highly variable habitats over their lifetime and males alternated between two migratory patterns, coastal or pelagic, as they either remained nearshore for their entire life or migrated offshore to later return to coastal habitats. Migratory contingents or partial migration might be a strategy of S. lewini to reduce vulnerability to stressors among regions. Scalloped hammerhead persistence in the Mexican Pacific, despite being heavily fished, may be linked to behavioral plasticity of movement rather than its life history characteristics.","[Coiraton, Claire] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Posgrad Ciencias Mar & Limnol, Av Joel Montes Camarena S-N, Mexico City 04510, DF, Mexico; [Amezcua, Felipe] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Ciencias Mar & Limnol, Av Joel Montes Camarena S-N, Mazatlan 82040, Sinaloa, Mexico; [Ketchum, James T.] Pelagios Kakunja AC, Cuauhtemoc 155, La Paz, Baja California, Mexico","Coiraton, C (corresponding author), Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Posgrad Ciencias Mar & Limnol, Av Joel Montes Camarena S-N, Mexico City 04510, DF, Mexico.",claire.coiraton@gmail.com; famezcua@ola.icmyl.unam.mx; jtketchum@ucdavis.edu,,"Amezcua, Felipe/0000-0001-6298-7531","Posgrado en Ciencias del Mar y Limnologia, UNAMUniversidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico; CONACyT, MexicoConsejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT)","The first author thanks the Posgrado en Ciencias del Mar y Limnologia, UNAM and CONACyT, Mexico for the support during her graduate studies.

Trophic ecology studies on white shark have been focused mainly on large and mature individuals, necessitating studies of young white shark trophic ecology to better understand their resource use. This study provides new insights into young white shark diet in the North eastern Pacific Ocean using stable isotope analysis in muscle tissues. We analyzed delta C-13 and delta N-15 values of young white shark muscle (n=21) from Sebastian Vizcaino Bay (SBV) during 2015-2018. We found changes in prey composition across early [neonates, young-of-the-years (YOYs), juveniles] white shark life stages, with significant changes in isotopic composition throughout early ontogeny. Mixing model results indicate a high use of coastal areas for foraging, mainly for juvenile stages and the substantial contribution of pelagic preys (e.g., S. japonicus, Prionotus spp., Cynoscion spp., S. sagax, etc.) in YOYs, white shark diet also indicates an important role of offshore foraging. This change in isotopic composition likely represents the shift from the embryo's typical maternally derived isotopic signature, incorporated in offshore foraging regions, to the postpartum isotopic composition incorporated by foraging neonates in inshore nursery habitats. This study provides relevant information regarding young white shark feeding preferences, reinforces the importance of coastal areas as critical habitat for the development and the successful foraging of this species, and also provides indirect insights on the feeding habits of the adult female of white sharks, which constitutes a baseline for further research.","[Tamburin, Elena; Elorriaga-Verplancken, Fernando R.; Sanchez-Gonzalez, Alberto; Galvan-Magana, Felipe] Inst Politecn Nacl, Ctr Interdisciplinario Ciencias Marinas, Av IPN S-N, La Paz 23096, Baja California, Mexico; [Tamburin, Elena; Estupinan-Montano, Colombo] Fdn Alium Pacific, Carrera 26 5C-13, Cali, Colombia; [Madigan, Daniel J.] Harvard Univ, Dept Organismal & Evolutionary Biol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Padilla, Mauricio Hoyos] Pelagios Kakunja AC, Sinaloa 1540 Col Los Garzas, La Paz 23070, Baja California, Mexico; [Padilla, Mauricio Hoyos] Fins Attached Marine Res & Conservat, 19675 Still Glen Dr, Colorado Springs, CO 80908 USA; [Wcisel, Michelle] Michigan State Univ Museum, 409 W Circle Dr, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA","Galvan-Magana, F (corresponding author), Inst Politecn Nacl, Ctr Interdisciplinario Ciencias Marinas, Av IPN S-N, La Paz 23096, Baja California, Mexico.",galvan.felipe@gmail.com,,"tamburin, elena/0000-0002-5692-6094; Hoyos, Edgar/0000-0002-4318-2655; Estupinan-Montano, Colombo/0000-0002-2355-3439","SIP Project [20150355, 20164779, 20181417]; WWF-Fundacion; Instituto Politecnico Nacional; EDI; COFAA","We thank the Programa Tiburon of the Centro Regional de Investigacion Pesquera de Ensenada (CRIP-Ensenada) supported sampling in Laguna Manuela; The Centro Interdisciplinario de Ciencias Marinas (CICIMAR), the Proyecto Tiburones y Rayas of the Fish Ecology Laboratory in CICIMAR for help with experimental infrastructure; The Instituto Politecnico Nacional (CONACYT, BEIFI, COFAA, EDI, and SIP Project 20150355, 20164779, and 20181417) and WWF-Fundacion Slim provided fellowships that made this research possible.

Immature females (19.6 mm ML) had sperm in their oviducal glands, indicating that female A. nouryi store sperm long after hectocotyli transmission by males. Potential fecundity was estimated as 31,000-75,026 eggs, with a batch fecundity of 2,000-8,000 eggs. Six distinct developmental stages were observed in the eggs suspended in the A. nouryi shell.

Using remote video, we investigated interactions between giant manta rays (Mobula birostris) and cleaner wrasse at a seamount in the Philippines. Cleaning events occurred between 11:00 and 16:00 h on a seasonal basis and were constrained by current strengths and ambient water temperatures. The frequency with which giant manta rays interacted with cleaner fish varied on an individual basis. Blue streaked cleaner wrasse (Labroides dimidiatus) and moon wrasse (Thalassoma lunare) selectively foraged on manta rays' gills and pelvis, with L. dimidiatus also demonstrating slight preferences for the pectoral fins. Cleaners' foraging preferences may indicate ectoparasitic infections in specific areas of a manta ray's body. The exclusivity with which giant manta rays visited a particular cleaning station on the seamount may be a response to the quality of services that cleaners provide there. Giant mantas' fidelity to this site may also be attributed to localised concentrations of food that are available nearby. The seamount provides habitat that appears to be important to the life history strategies of the region's giant manta rays.","[Murie, Calum; Spencer, Matthew] Univ Liverpool, Sch Environm Sci, Liverpool L69 3GP, Merseyside, England; [Murie, Calum] Underwater Africa Fdn, Tofo, Inhambane, Mozambique; [Murie, Calum; Oliver, Simon P.] Univ Chester, Dept Biol Sci, Chester CH1 4BJ, Cheshire, England; [Oliver, Simon P.] Thresher Shark Res & Conservat Project, Malapascua Island, Cebu, Philippines","Oliver, SP (corresponding author), Univ Chester, Dept Biol Sci, Chester CH1 4BJ, Cheshire, England.; Oliver, SP (corresponding author), Thresher Shark Res & Conservat Project, Malapascua Island, Cebu, Philippines.",s.oliver@chester.ac.uk,,"Oliver, Simon/0000-0002-2975-1233",Thresher Shark Research and Conservation Project,"This work was funded by the Thresher Shark Research and Conservation Project.

The whale shark, Rhincodon typus, is the largest fish in the world and is highly valued in the eco-tourism sector. Despite conservation concerns and advances in our understanding of their life history, basic demographic parameters for growth, longevity and mortality are of questionable accuracy; previous growth studies could not agree whether the vertebral growth bands were formed annually or biannually. Here, we provide the first validation of the annual formation of growth bands within the vertebrae of the whale shark using bomb radiocarbon assays. Ages of up to 50 years were estimated from sectioned vertebrae of sharks collected in Taiwan and Pakistan. There was no cessation of the formation of growth bands in the vertebrae of older sharks and our study provides the oldest observed longevity for this species. Initial estimates of growth (k = 0.01-0.12) and natural mortality rates (M = 0.09-0.14) are consistent with those expected of long-lived sharks, which highlights their sensitivity to fishing pressure and conservation concerns.","[Ong, Joyce J.

Out of 200 individual stingrays, more than a third were encountered again. The home range of the females appears to be restricted, which supports the notion of high site residency. As resident populations of stingrays could suffer from a lack of population connectivity and be predestined for genetic isolation and local extirpation, this study further investigated the genetic connectivity of four sample sites in the central and western Bahamas. A haplotype analysis from the mitochondrial D-loop region showed that no distinct population structure strictly correlated with the sample site. These findings were complemented by five microsatellite loci that revealed high degrees in genotypic variability and little population differentiation.

The stomach contents of 249 albacore individuals, caught by industrial longliners and artisanal fishers, was analysed, and the dominant prey taxa were selected for lipid and fatty acid (FA) analysis. The FA profiles of prey were compared with those of liver tissue of spawning-capable and post-spawning female albacore, using multivariate analysis. Whereas stomach content analysis identified cephalopods and crustaceans as the dominant prey items in number, FA-profile analysis identified crustaceans and fishes as the most-frequently consumed prey of post-spawning female albacore. In contrast, the FA profiles of spawning-capable albacore and those of prey showed very low similarity. Analysis of the prey suggests that although cephalopods, crustaceans and fishes could all provide albacore with the required lipids and FAs, cephalopod prey seem to be less desirable owing to their lower energy content (i.e. low in total lipid, triacylglycerol, 16:0, 18:0 and 18:1 omega 9). Instead, the most beneficial food appeared to be locally available fishes, which are more energy-rich and have a higher docosahexaenoic acid/ eicosapentaenoic acid ratio. These results provide new information on the trophic ecology of albacore, promote our understanding of the importance of prey type for successful reproduction of albacore, and highlight the advantages of FA profiling to study diet.","[Dhurmeea, Z.; Appadoo, C.] Univ Mauritius, Dept Biosci & Ocean Studies, Fac Sci, Reduit, Mauritius; [Dhurmeea, Z.; Bodin, N.] Inst Rech Dev, UMR MARBEC, Victoria, Mahe, Seychelles; [Dhurmeea, Z.; Pethybridge, H.] CSIRO Oceans & Atmosphere, Hobart, Tas, Australia; [Romanov, E., V] Ctr Tech Appui Peche Reunionnaise CAP RUN CITEB, Le Port, Reunion, France; [Bodin, N.] Seychelles Fishing Author, Victoria, Mahe, Seychelles","Dhurmeea, Z (corresponding author), Univ Mauritius, Dept Biosci & Ocean Studies, Fac Sci, Reduit, Mauritius.; Dhurmeea, Z (corresponding author), Inst Rech Dev, UMR MARBEC, Victoria, Mahe, Seychelles.; Dhurmeea, Z (corresponding author), CSIRO Oceans & Atmosphere, Hobart, Tas, Australia.",dzahirah@hotmail.com,,"Chandani, APPADOO/0000-0002-4381-8238; bodin, nathalie/0000-0001-8464-0213; Pethybridge, Heidi/0000-0002-7291-5766",`Allocations de Recherche pour une These au Sud' (ARTS) programme of the Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD),"This research was undertaken as part of a PhD dissertation by the first author, funded by the `Allocations de Recherche pour une These au Sud' (ARTS) programme of the Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD).

In order to implement effective conservation strategies for species of this taxa, it is crucial that movement patterns at a range of spatiotemporal scales are defined. To gain insight into such patterns, we deployed a combination of acoustic (n = 21) and satellite (n = 12) tags on reef manta rays Mobula alfredi in the British Indian Ocean Territory Marine Protected Area (BIOT MPA) annually from 2013 through 2016. An extensive array of acoustic receivers (n = 52) were deployed across the archipelago to record the movements of mantas throughout the MPA. Data revealed large individual variation in horizontal movement patterns, ranging from high local site fidelity (<10 km) for up to 3 yr, to large-scale regional movements (>200 km) around the entire MPA. Depth time-series data recorded vertical movement patterns consistent with other epipelagic elasmobranch species, including oscillatory diving and deep dives to greater than 500 m. Though no individuals were directly recorded departing the MPA throughout the study, the gaps in detections and estimated travel speeds documented here indicate that movement of individuals outside of the BIOT MPA cannot be discounted. Collectively, our data suggests that, with effective enforcement, the current size of the BIOT MPA is providing substantial protection to its reef manta ray population. Characterization of movement patterns across ontogenetic classes, however, is required to fully characterize the spatial ecology of this species and ensure protection across all cohorts of the population.","[Andrzejaczek, Samantha; Chapple, Taylor K.; Castleton, Michael; Schallert, Robert J.; Block, Barbara A.] Stanford Univ, Hopkins Marine Stn, Pacific Grove, CA 93950 USA; [Chapple, Taylor K.] Oregon State Univ, Coastal Oregon Marine Stn, Newport, OR 97365 USA; [Curnick, David J.; Jacoby, David M.

Where and why animals migrate, and what patterns can be derived from individual movements in order to make population-level inferences are key areas when attempting to define basic population dynamics. These questions are of equal interest to biologists and managers, with many species assessments identifying improvements in the understanding of population-level movement as a key research need. We aimed to improve our understanding of population level movement for common thresher sharks Alopias vulpinus by leveraging the largest satellite tagging dataset available for this species. Using a Bayesian approach specifically designed to address population-level questions with sparse telemetry data, we identified that A. vulpinus off the west coast of North America are partial migrators which conditionally migrate, based on a combination of fixed intrinsic states (size, sex) and variable extrinsic states (e.g. season, environment). Waters of the Southern California Bight were identified as an area where, seasonally, a large variety of sizes of A. vulpinus can be found. While smaller juveniles can be found throughout the year, larger sub-adults and adults often move out of the Bight during certain seasons (spring and winter). Knowledge of how A. vulpinus distribute along the coast, and that season, size, and to some extent sex, play important roles in where and what type of animals are likely to be found, are key pieces of information when attempting to accurately characterize basic biological parameters like age, growth, and reproduction, as well as understanding the effects of variable fishing pressures across the species' range.","[Kinney, Michael J.; Kacev, Dovi; Dewar, Heidi; Eguchi, Tomoharu] Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Southwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, NOAA, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA; [Sippel, Tim] Washington Dept Fish & Wildlife, Olympia, WA 98501 USA","Kinney, MJ (corresponding author), Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Southwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, NOAA, La Jolla, CA 92037 USA.",michael.kinney@noaa.gov,,,,,,61,0,0,7,7,INTER-RESEARCH,OLDENDORF LUHE,"NORDBUNTE 23, D-21385 OLDENDORF LUHE, GERMANY",0171-8630,1616-1599,,MAR ECOL PROG SER,Mar.

In 2010, a cold snap across south Florida had wide-ranging impacts, including negative effects on recreational fisheries, agriculture, and ecological communities. Here, we use acoustic telemetry and historical longline monitoring to assess the long-term implications of this event on juvenile bull sharks Carcharhinus leucas in the Florida Everglades. Despite the loss of virtually all individuals (ca. 90%) within the Shark River Estuary during the cold snap, the catch per unit effort (CPUE) of age 0 sharks on longlines recovered through recruitment within 6-8 mo of the event. Acoustic telemetry revealed that habitat use patterns of age 0-2 sharks reached an equilibrium in 4-6 yr. In contrast, the CPUE and habitat use of age 3 sharks required 5-7 yr to resemble pre-cold snap patterns. Environmental conditions and predation risk returned to previous levels within 1 yr of the cold snap, but abundances of some prey species remained depressed for several years. Reduced prey availability may have altered the profitability of some microhabitats after the cold snap, leading to more rapid ontogenetic shifts to marine waters among sharks for several years. Accelerated ontogenetic shifts coupled with inter-individual behavioral variability of bull sharks likely led to a slower recovery rate than predicted based on overall shark CPUE. While intrinsic variation driven by stochasticity in dynamic ecosystems may increase the resistance of species to chronic and acute disturbance, it may also increase recovery time in filling the diversity of niches occupied prior to disturbance if resistive capacity is exceeded.","[Matich, Philip] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Marine Biol, 1001 Texas Clipper Rd, Galveston, TX 77553 USA; [Matich, Philip; Strickland, Bradley A.; Heithaus, Michael R.] Florida Int Univ, Marine Sci Program, 3000 NE 151 St, North Miami, FL 33181 USA","Matich, P (corresponding author), Texas A&M Univ, Dept Marine Biol, 1001 Texas Clipper Rd, Galveston, TX 77553 USA.; Matich, P (corresponding author), Florida Int Univ, Marine Sci Program, 3000 NE 151 St, North Miami, FL 33181 USA.",pmati001@fiu.edu,,,"National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DBI0620409, DEB9910514, DRL0959026]; PADI Foundation; Zoo Miami Conservation and Research Fund; Southeastern Environmental Research Center; Florida International University's Marine Sciences Program","Funding for this project was provided by the National Science Foundation to the Florida Coastal Everglades LTER Program (DBI0620409, DEB9910514, DRL0959026), the PADI Foundation, Zoo Miami Conservation and Research Fund, the Southeastern Environmental Research Center, and Florida International University's Marine Sciences Program.

Detailed measurements of their length show that they are exceptionally long and unusually continuous. The Great Southern Scarp is the southern edge of the Nullarbor Plain's Bunda Plateau; it is cut into shallow marine sediments and extends for 820 km. Once a continuous sea-cliff, local uplift has isolated two sections from the ocean, so it now comprises the Bunda Cliffs (210 km of coastal cliff, 180 km of which is uninterrupted cliff line), Hampton Range (inland; 300 km), Baxter Cliffs (160 km of coastal cliff) and Wylie Scarp (inland; 160 km). The Zuytdorp Cliffs are coastal cliffs cut into eolianite, and extend for 210 km with an uninterrupted section of 120 km. The length of the Great Southern Scarp and the Zuytdorp Cliffs results from an unusual combination of circumstances. They are both composed of poorly jointed, relatively homogenous biogenic calcarenites, presented to high-energy ocean waves by regional uplift. The carbonates are sufficiently well cemented to maintain a steep vertical cliff face, but susceptible to disintegration under direct wave attack. Cliff retreat has been fairly uniform because of the broad spatial scale of both lithology and erosion. The arid climate, absence of nearby non-karstic catchments and karstic nature of the cliffs' hinterlands has discouraged integrated drainage development, so no significant fluvial systems dissect the cliffs; this is a key factor in cliff edge preservation. In the case of the Great Southern Scarp, these processes have formed the longest continuous cliff line in Australia and probably the world. Referenced against criteria from Australia's National Heritage List, the cliffs have potentially international/national levels of significance for the rarity of their scale, their demonstration of landscape evolution, and their spectacular beauty.","[Wakelin-King, G.

Ejaculates were collected from aquarium (n = 24) and in situ (n = 34) sand tiger sharks Carcharias taurus. Volume, pH, osmolarity, sperm concentration, motility, status, morphology, and plasma membrane integrity were assessed for each ejaculate. Semen with the highest proportion of motile sperm was collected between April and June for both in situ and aquarium sand tiger sharks indicating a seasonal reproductive cycle. Overall, 17 of 30 semen samples collected from aquarium sharks from April through June contained motile sperm compared to 29 of 29 of in situ sharks, demonstrating semen quality differences between aquarium and in situ sharks. Sperm motility, status, morphology, and plasma membrane integrity were significantly higher (P < 0.05) for in situ compared to aquarium sand tiger sharks. Testosterone was measured by an enzyme immunoassay validated for the species. Testosterone concentration was seasonal for both aquarium and in situ sharks with highest concentrations measured in spring and lowest in summer. In situ sharks had higher (P < 0.05) testosterone concentration in spring than aquarium sharks. This study demonstrated annual reproduction with spring seasonality for male sand tiger sharks through marked seasonal differences in testosterone and semen production. Lower testosterone and poorer semen quality was observed in aquarium sharks likely contributing to the species' limited reproductive success in aquariums.

Aggregation areas, such as Guadalupe Island, Mexico, that have been related to feeding events, are of special interest for this species conservation. The aim of this study was to describe the fatty acid profile of C. carcharias' muscle for the first time in Guadalupe Island, using non-lethal biopsy methods to determine ontogenetic and sex differences in relation to diet and habitat use. Fatty acid profiles and biomarkers from different individuals are explored as a source of integrated information of their diet. Analysis of the fatty acid composition of individuals with varying total lengths (2.3-5.0 m) suggested a dietary shift between juveniles and adults occurring at aproximately 3 m. Fatty acid biomarkers indicated a higher degree of carnivorism in adults than in juveniles. Additionally, these ecological tracers suggested that juveniles feed in shallow waters close to the coast, while adults feed in deep waters along inshore and offshore areas. This study represents a first step towards using fatty acid composition as a relevant tool for further understanding dietary shifts and habitat use throughout the ontogeny of C. carcharias. However, to corroborate this, further studies with larger sample sizes are required.","[Alderete-Macal, Maria Jose; Caraveo-Patino, Javier] Ctr Invest Biol Noroeste CIBNOR, Av Inst Politecn Nacl 195, La Paz 23096, Bcs, Mexico; [Hoyos-Padilla, Edgar Mauricio] Pelagios Kakunja AC, Calle Sinaloa 1540, La Paz 23070, Bcs, Mexico; [Hoyos-Padilla, Edgar Mauricio] Fins Attached, Marine Res & Conservat, 19675 Still Glen Dr, Colorado Springs, CO 80908 USA","Caraveo-Patino, J (corresponding author), Ctr Invest Biol Noroeste CIBNOR, Av Inst Politecn Nacl 195, La Paz 23096, Bcs, Mexico.",jcaraveo04@cibnor.mx,,"Hoyos, Edgar/0000-0002-4318-2655",CIBNOR; Pelagios Kakunja A.C.; Annemberg Foundation; Alianza WWF-FCS; Alianza WWF-Fundacion Telmex Telcel; CONACYTConsejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT),"We thank CIBNOR, Pelagios Kakunja A.C., Annemberg Foundation, Alianza WWF-FCS, Alianza WWF-Fundacion Telmex Telcel, and CONACYT for funding this study.

Fats are chemically triglycerides in which glycerol is esterified with three fatty acids. The fats are generally obtained from animal by rendering methods. The main difference between fat and oil is that they are solid and liquid at room temperature respectively. Fatty acid composition present in oil is determined by GC-MS analysis. And it mainly includes oleic acid, palmitic acid, stearic acid, linoleic acid and linolenic acid. This composition plays an important role in antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, antibacterial activities. The therapeutic products from the animal's fat and oils are presenting the tremendous acceptability for human, while used by various route of administrations for various internal and external therapeutic indications. This merit of the animal's fat and oils make it an exceptional choice for using them as a drug. The key fatty acid present in the oil are mainly responsible for the therapeutic activity. The different types of fat obtained from varieties of animal include crocodile, turtle, lizard, sheep, cobra, shark, python etc. Lack of scientific evidence for the traditional healing practice using animal fats or its oils make researches to scientifically prove the therapeutic activity and this may lead to the new era for the development of a variety of novel formulations. Animal based products are also gained importance along with animal based medicines. This article focuses on various animal fats, its traditional uses and some of the formulations developed recently by using these.","[Mishra, Bharat; Akhila, M., V; Thomas, Ann; Benny, Biliya; Assainar, Hiba] Nirmala Coll Pharm, Ernakulam, Kerala, India","Mishra, B (corresponding author), Nirmala Coll Pharm, Dept Pharmacol & Res & Dev Cell, Ernakulam 686661, Kerala, India.",bharatekansh@gmail.com,,,,,,37,0,0,0,0,"INPHARM ASSOC, PHCOG NET",BANGELORE,"17, II FLOOR, BUDDHA VIHAR RD, COX TOWN, BANGELORE, 560 005, INDIA",2230-973X,2230-9713,,INT J PHARM INVESTIG,INT.

Although, blue shark is relatively productive, concerns have been raised related to the decline in population of these apex fish predators; and this decline can affect the marine ecology. This paper presents catch per unit effort (CPUE) data of blue sharks obtained from observers' on-board Chinese pelagic longline fishing vessels from 2009-2014 in the Pacific Ocean. All the blue shark species were incidentally captured (without shark hook). Nominal CPUE ranged from 0 individual per 1000 hooks to 5.21 individuals per 1000 hooks; the highest annual average nominal CPUE recorded in this study was 0.89 individual per 1000 hooks in 2011 while, 0.58 was the lowest recorded in 2010. Our results equally indicates that, blue shark population was so close to MSY level showing that fishing mortality rate might surpass MSY level in the future, since decrease in catches were observed. Therefore, additional management measures should be implemented in the Pacific Ocean in order to achieve a healthy stock status of this species.","[Li, W.

This individual was characterized by pale yellow or white rounded to elongated spots on a dark grey background. Satellite-derived oceanographic parameters such as Sea Surface Temperature (SST), Sea Surface Salinity (SSS) and Chlorophyll 'a', (Chl-a) for the location where the animal was recorded, have shown different patterns from rest of the area and thus provided an insight into the preferred environmental conditions and foraging behavior of this species. The sighting location, off the Goa coast, was characterized by high Chlorophyll-a (1.2-1.8 mg/m(-3)), dissolved oxygen (4 ml/l) in the 50 m depth and high concentrations of phytoplankton dominated by green Noctiluca scintillans. Present sighting merit the record of R. typus with the probability of foraging on the high abundance of phytoplankton in the coastal waters of the Arabian Sea.

However, the recognized thermal habitats of these regional populations are poorly described. Here, we report the thermal range, catch frequency with bottom temperature, and catch frequency with time of year for both shark species in Narragansett Bay, Rhode Island. Additionally, we describe levels of two thermal stress response indicators, heat-shock protein 70 and trimethylamine N-oxide, with an experimental increase in water temperature from 15 degrees C to 21 degrees C. Our results show that S. acanthias can be found in this region year-round and co-occurs with M. canis from June to November. Further, adult S. acanthias routinely inhabits colder waters than M. canis (highest catch frequencies at bottom temperatures of 10 degrees C and 21 degrees C, respectively), but both exhibit similar upper thermal ranges in this region (bottom temperatures of 22-23 degrees C). Additionally, acute exposure to a 6 degrees C increase in water temperature for 72 hours leads to a nearly threefold increase in heat-shock protein 70 levels in S. acanthias but not M. canis. Therefore, these species display differences in their thermal tolerance and stress response with experimental exposure to 21 degrees C, a common summer temperature in Narragansett Bay. Further, in temperature-stressed S. acanthias there is no accumulation of trimethylamine N-oxide. At the whole-organism level, elasmobranchs' trimethylamine N-oxide regulatory capacity may be limited by other factors. Alternatively, elasmobranchs may not rely on trimethylamine N-oxide as a primary thermal protective mechanism under the conditions tested. Findings from this study are in contrast with previous research conducted with elasmobranch cells in vitro that showed accumulation of trimethylamine N-oxide after thermal stress and subsequent suppression of the heat-shock protein 70 response.","[Bockus, Abigail B.; Seibel, Brad A.] Univ Rhode Isl, Dept Biol Sci, Coll Environm & Life Sci, 120 Flagg Rd, Kingston, RI 02881 USA; [Labreck, Christopher J.; Camberg, Jodi L.] Univ Rhode Isl, Coll Environm & Life Sci, Dept Cell & Mol Biol, 120 Flagg Rd, Kingston, RI 02881 USA; [Collie, Jeremy S.] Univ Rhode Isl, Grad Sch Oceanog, 215 South Ferry Rd, Narragansett, RI 02882 USA; [Bockus, Abigail B.] Louisiana Univ Marine Consortium, 8124 Highway 56, Chauvin, LA 70344 USA; [Seibel, Brad A.] Univ S Florida, Coll Marine Sci, 830 1st St SE, St Petersburg, FL 33701 USA","Bockus, AB (corresponding author), Univ Rhode Isl, Dept Biol Sci, Coll Environm & Life Sci, 120 Flagg Rd, Kingston, RI 02881 USA.; Bockus, AB (corresponding author), Louisiana Univ Marine Consortium, 8124 Highway 56, Chauvin, LA 70344 USA.",abockus@lumcon.edu,"Camberg, Jodi/AAX-3737-2020",,"National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [ANT-1246349, EPS-1004057]; University of Rhode Island","We thank Lauren Benoit and Katie Viducic for their assistance with feeding, treatment, and laboratory analyses.

Collagen also represents a valid resource for bioplastics and biomaterials, to be used in the emerging health sectors. Recently, marine organisms have been considered as promising sources of collagen, because they do not harbor transmissible disease. In particular, fish biomass as well as by-catch organisms, such as undersized fish, jellyfish, sharks, starfish, and sponges, possess a very high collagen content. The use of discarded and underused biomass could contribute to the development of a sustainable process for collagen extraction, with a significantly reduced environmental impact. This addresses the European zero-waste strategy, which supports all three generally accepted goals of sustainability: sustainable economic well-being, environmental protection, and social well-being. A zero-waste strategy would use far fewer new raw materials and send no waste materials to landfills. In this review, we present an overview of the studies carried out on collagen obtained from by-catch organisms and fish wastes. Additionally, we discuss novel technologies based on thermoplastic processes that could be applied, likewise, as marine collagen treatment.","[Coppola, Daniela; Lauritano, Chiara; de Pascale, Donatella] Stn Zool Anton Dohrn, Dept Marine Biotechnol, I-80121 Naples, Italy; [Coppola, Daniela] CNR, Inst Biosci & BioResources IBBR, Via Pietro Castellino 111, I-80131 Naples, Italy; [Oliviero, Maria; Iannace, Salvatore] CNR, Inst Polymers Composites & Biomat, Ple E Fermi 1, I-80055 Naples, Italy; [Vitale, Giovanni Andrea; de Pascale, Donatella] CNR, Inst Biochem & Cell Biol IBBC, Via Pietro Castellino 111, I-80131 Naples, Italy; [D'Ambra, Isabella] Stn Zool Anton Dohrn, Dept Integrat Marine Ecol, I-80121 Naples, Italy","de Pascale, D (corresponding author), Stn Zool Anton Dohrn, Dept Marine Biotechnol, I-80121 Naples, Italy.; de Pascale, D (corresponding author), CNR, Inst Biochem & Cell Biol IBBC, Via Pietro Castellino 111, I-80131 Naples, Italy.",daniela.coppola@szn.it; maria.oliviero@cnr.it; giovanniandrea.vitale@ibbc.cnr.it; chiara.lauritano@szn.it; isabella.dambra@szn.it; salvatore.iannace@cnr.it; donatella.depascale@szn.it,"; Lauritano, Chiara/Q-4166-2018","Iannace, Salvatore/0000-0003-1487-4983; de Pascale, Donatella/0000-0002-6732-0901; Lauritano, Chiara/0000-0003-4580-9594",H2020-MSCA-RISE Ocean Medicines [GA 690944]; H2020-MSCA-ITN-ETN MarPipe [GA 721421],"The authors thank the H2020-MSCA-RISE Ocean Medicines, GA 690944 and the H2020-MSCA-ITN-ETN MarPipe, GA 721421 for the partial support.

The current study aimed to examine the spatial-temporal distribution of fishing effort and the catch levels obtained by the Venezuelan industrial multigear fishing fleet during the period 2015-2018. Fishing gear types employed by this fleet in order of preference were as follows: bottom longline (target sea catfishes [family Ariidae]), trap (target snappers [family Lutjanidae]), pelagic longline (target tunas [family Scombridae]), hand line (target mackerels [family Scombridae]), and shark longline (target sea catfishes and sharks [families Carcharhinidae, Squalidae, Sphyrnidae, Ginglymostomatidae, Alopiidae, and Triakidae]). The kernel intensity estimator determined that the main fishing area was the North Brazil Shelf (comprising 95% of the total fishing sets). Fishing effort (fishing sets per trip) distribution may be associated with oceanic fronts present in the region. A change in the dynamics of the fleet were recorded, with an increase in the use of bottom longlines, along with a decrease in the use of traps, possibly due to overfishing of resources caught by traps. The analyses of covariance showed a linear and positive relationship between the catch and fishing effort but with significant changes over the study period for traps and bottom longlines, since in the years where the fishing effort of traps was lower there were greater catches by unit of effort, and vice versa for bottom longlines, where lower catches by unit effort were obtained in years with greater effort.","[Laurent Singh, Carolina Mercedes; de Carvalho Freitas, Carlos Edwar] Univ Fed Amazonas, Lab Fisheries Ecol, Manaus, Amazonas, Brazil; [Laurent Singh, Carolina Mercedes] Socialist Inst Fisheries & Aquaculture, Cumana, Sucre, Venezuela; [Aguiar-Santos, Jamerson] Natl Inst Amazonian Res, Lab Aquat Ecosyst, Manaus, Amazonas, Brazil; [Gondim Ferreira, Efrem Jorge] Natl Inst Amazonian Res, Coordinat Biodivers Res, Manaus, Amazonas, Brazil; [del Carmen Evaristo, Eucaris] Minist Popular Power Fisheries & Aquaculture, Caracas, Venezuela","Singh, CML (corresponding author), Univ Fed Amazonas, Lab Fisheries Ecol, Manaus, Amazonas, Brazil.; Singh, CML (corresponding author), Socialist Inst Fisheries & Aquaculture, Cumana, Sucre, Venezuela.",carolinalaurent@gmail.com,"Aguiar-Santos, Jamerson/W-9111-2018; Freitas, Carlos/F-1752-2014","Aguiar-Santos, Jamerson/0000-0003-4666-0226; Freitas, Carlos/0000-0001-5406-0998",Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e TecnologicoNational Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq); Ministerio del Poder Popular de Pesca y Acuicultura,"The authors thank the Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico for financial support and the Ministerio del Poder Popular de Pesca y Acuicultura and the Instituto Socialista de Pesca y Acuicultura for cooperation and making available the data used in this study.

In his description of the species Broussonet says: M. de Jussieu a bien voulu nous cn communiquer un dessin fait par Mrs. dc l'Academie, envoy& par ordre du Roi, vers la fin du dernier siecle, pour faire des observations anatomiques sur les bords de l'Ocean ; it est designe sous le nom de Brucus.

We have seen in the cabinet of the King the individual according to which this figure had been made]. The pursuing of the dues contained in this quotation made it possible to find in the archives of the Museum national d'Histoire naturelle the collection containing the illustration of the type, made in 1680 on the Bayonne coast, as well as the authors that had subsequently been anonymized after the French Revolution, namely the anatomist Joseph-Guichard Du Verney and the astronomer Philippe de La Hire, members of the Academie royale des Sciences. The beautiful anatomical plates of the collection were intended to serve Claude Perrault to illustrate the fourth volume of the Mimoires pour servir a Phistoire naturelle des animaux dedicated to ichthyology but whose publishing was curtailed. At the beginning of the 19th century, Blainville was the last zoologist to examine the type and to produce a second unpublished manuscript illustration. This iconic shark, formerly exploited, has been extirpated from European waters and is now on the brink of global extinction. Its early disappearance since the beginning of fisheries industrialization has gone unheeded due to the lack of historical summaries concerning this species. Revealing the story of its description constitutes a first step towards filling this knowledge gap.","[Iglesias, Samuel P.] Univ Antilles, Sorbonne Univ, Inst Systemat Evolut Biodiversite ISYEB, Museum Natl Hist Nat,CNRS,EPHE,Stn Marine Concarn, Pl Croix, F-29900 Concarneau, France; [Mollen, Frederik H.] Elasmobranch Res, Rehaegenstr 4, B-2820 Bonheiden, Belgium","Iglesias, SP (corresponding author), Univ Antilles, Sorbonne Univ, Inst Systemat Evolut Biodiversite ISYEB, Museum Natl Hist Nat,CNRS,EPHE,Stn Marine Concarn, Pl Croix, F-29900 Concarneau, France.",samuel.iglesias@mnhn.fr; frederik.mollen@gmail.com,,"Iglesias, Samuel/0000-0002-2926-9770",,,,20,0,0,1,1,"PUBLICATIONS SCIENTIFIQUES DU MUSEUM, PARIS",PARIS CEDEX 05,"CP 39-57, RUE CUVIER, F-75231 PARIS CEDEX 05, FRANCE",1280-9551,1638-9387,,ZOOSYSTEMA,Zoosystema,APR,2020,42,13,,,,,173,193,,10.5252/zoosystema2020v42a13,,,21,Zoology,Zoology,LJ3TV,WOS:000530091500001,,Green Published,,,9/10/20

Yet, one-third of these animals are at risk of extinction. To better understand the potential consequences of megafaunal loss, here we quantify their current functional diversity, predict future changes under different extinction scenarios, and introduce a new metric [functionally unique, specialized and endangered (FUSE)] that identifies threatened species of particular importance for functional diversity. Simulated extinction scenarios forecast marked declines in functional richness if current trajectories are maintained during the next century (11% globally; up to 24% regionally), with more marked reductions (48% globally; up to 70% at the poles) beyond random expectations if all threatened species eventually go extinct. Among the megafaunal groups, sharks will incur a disproportionate loss of functional richness. We identify top FUSE species and suggest a renewed focus on these species to preserve the ecosystem functions provided by marine megafauna.","[Pimiento, C.; Griffin, J.

Our sample includes 1793 galaxies at z < 0.11 observed with the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope, for which Sloan Digital Sky Survey spectroscopy and hierarchy information are also available. We find a cosmic III mass density of Omega(HI) = (3.99 +/- 0.54) x 10(-4) h(70)(-1) at < z > = 0.065. For the central and satellite galaxies, we obtain Omega(HI) of (3.51 +/- 0.49) x 10(-4) h(70)(-1) and (0.90 +/- 0.16) x 10(-4) h(70)(-1), respectively. We show that galaxies above and below stellar masses of similar to 10(9.3) M-circle dot contribute in roughly equal measure to the global value of Omega(HI). While consistent with estimates based on targeted III surveys, our results are in tension with previous theoretical work. We show that these differences are, at least partly, due to the empirical recipe used to set the partition between atomic and molecular hydrogen in semi-analytical models. Moreover, comparing our measurements with the cosmological semi-analytic models of galaxy formation SHARK and GALFORM reveals gradual stripping of gas via ram pressure works better to fully reproduce the properties of satellite galaxies in our sample than strangulation. Our findings highlight the power of this approach in constraining theoretical models and confirm the non-negligible contribution of massive galaxies to the HI mass budget of the local Universe.","[Hu, Wenkai; Chen, Xuelei] Chinese Acad Sci, Natl Astron Observ, Key Lab Computat Astrophys, 20A Datun Rd, Beijing 100012, Peoples R China; [Hu, Wenkai; Catinella, Barbara; Cortese, Luca; Staveley-Smith, Lister; Lagos, Claudia del P.; Chauhan, Garima] Univ Western Australia, Int Ctr Radio Astron Res, M468,35 Stirling Hwy, Perth, WA 6009, Australia; [Hu, Wenkai; Chen, Xuelei] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Sch Astron & Space Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Hu, Wenkai; Catinella, Barbara; Cortese, Luca; Staveley-Smith, Lister; Lagos, Claudia del P.; Chauhan, Garima] ARC Ctr Excellence All Sky Astrophys 3 Dimens AST, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Oosterloo, Tom] ASTRON, Postbus 2, NL-7990 AA Dwingeloo, Netherlands; [Oosterloo, Tom] Univ Groningen, Kapteyn Astron Inst, POB 800, NL-9700 AV Groningen, Netherlands; [Chen, Xuelei] Peking Univ, Ctr High Energy Phys, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China","Hu, WK (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Natl Astron Observ, Key Lab Computat Astrophys, 20A Datun Rd, Beijing 100012, Peoples R China.; Hu, WK; Cortese, L; Staveley-Smith, L (corresponding author), Univ Western Australia, Int Ctr Radio Astron Res, M468,35 Stirling Hwy, Perth, WA 6009, Australia.; Hu, WK (corresponding author), Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Sch Astron & Space Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China.; Hu, WK; Cortese, L; Staveley-Smith, L (corresponding author), ARC Ctr Excellence All Sky Astrophys 3 Dimens AST, Sydney, NSW, Australia.",wkhu@nao.cas.cn; luca.cortese@uwa.edu.au; lister.staveley-smith@uwa.edu.au,,"Chauhan, Garima/0000-0002-2969-4013; Cortese, Luca/0000-0002-7422-9823; Catinella, Barbara/0000-0002-7625-562X; Lagos, Claudia/0000-0003-3021-8564; Hu, Wenkai/0000-0002-3108-5591",Netherlands Foundation for Scientific Research (NWO)Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO); Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence for All Sky Astrophysics in 3 Dimensions (ASTRO 3D)Australian Research Council [CE170100013]; Australian Research Council Future Fellowship - Australian GovernmentAustralian Research Council [FT180100066],"The WSRT is operated by ASTRON (Netherlands Foundation for Research in Astronomy) with support from the Netherlands Foundation for Scientific Research (NWO).

This system presents a field-based alternative to laboratory respirometers, opening opportunities for studies on species in remote localities, increasing the ability to validate physiological field studies.","[Byrnes, Evan E.; Lear, Karissa O.; Morgan, David L.; Gleiss, Adrian C.] Murdoch Univ, Ctr Sustainable Aquat Ecosyst, Harry Butler Inst, Perth, WA 6150, Australia; [Byrnes, Evan E.; Lear, Karissa O.; Morgan, David L.; Gleiss, Adrian C.] Murdoch Univ, Coll Sci Hlth Engn & Educ, Perth, WA, Australia","Byrnes, EE (corresponding author), Murdoch Univ, Ctr Sustainable Aquat Ecosyst, Harry Butler Inst, Perth, WA 6150, Australia.",evan.byrnes@murdoch.edu.au,"Morgan, David L./H-9794-2019","Morgan, David L./0000-0003-1948-1484",f,The authors thank T.

Is it the healthy retiree who expects to live long and might become a centenarian, or is the unhealthy retiree with a short life expectancy more likely to appreciate the pooling of longevity risk? What if the unhealthy retiree is pooled with someone who is much healthier and forced to pay an implicit loading? To answer these and related questions this paper examines the empirical conditions under which retirees benefit (or may not) from longevity risk pooling by linking the economics of annuity equivalent wealth to actuarially models of aging. I focus attention on the Compensation Law of Mortality which implies that individuals with higher relative mortality (e.g., lower income) age more slowly and experience greater longevity uncertainty. Ergo, they place higher utility value on the annuity. The impetus for this research today is the increasing evidence on the growing disparity in longevity expectations between rich and poor.","[Milevsky, Moshe A.] York Univ, Schulich Sch Business, Toronto, ON, Canada","Milevsky, MA (corresponding author), York Univ, Schulich Sch Business, Toronto, ON, Canada.",milevsky@yorku.ca,,,,,,43,1,1,1,1,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1474-7472,1475-3022,,J PENSION ECON FINAN,J.

However, excess Se values (all values in mu g g(-1) d.w.) observed in neonates (5.366) and juveniles (2.815) prove to maintain antioxidant ability by inducing Hg excretion and reducing its toxicity. Calculated Biomagnification Factor (BMFTL) denoted high values for the prey C.hippurus, signifying absolute magnification of Hg and Se along the food chain.

Such associations, if driven by an underlying proximate mechanism, could limit the independent evolution of each behaviour. In contrast, a behavioural syndrome may be the result of selection favouring the behavioural correlation under certain ecological circumstances. In this context, investigating the stability and the potential drivers of behavioural syndromes is a fundamental step towards understanding how they might shape the evolution of behaviours. We assessed syndrome stability across time in two subpopulations of free-ranging juvenile lemon sharks, Negaprion brevirostris. We measured two behaviours, exploration in an open field and sociability in a group, over 5 years. We tested whether these behaviours were associated in a behavioural syndrome, how stable this syndrome was and whether its strength was predicted by ecological conditions in this system: predator abundance, juvenile survival, newborn recruitment and total subpopulation size. We found that a behavioural syndrome was only observed in the subpopulation where predatory shark abundance was higher. Across years, newborn recruitment was the main driver for the strength of the syndrome. During years of low recruitment, the subpopulations probably experienced lower competition due to fewer newborns joining the population. In these years, sharks that were more explorative were also less social. These results indicate that the behaviours we tested were plastic and responsive to ecological conditions. Since this could signify that they are only favoured under certain ecological conditions, we argue in this case that the correlation of two behavioural traits is adaptive.

In the rRNA operon, introns can insert in the small subunit (SSU) and large subunit (LSU) of a wide variety of protists and various prokaryotes, but they were never found in the ITS region. In this study, unusually long ITS regions of fungi and closely related unicellular organisms (Polychytrium aggregatum, Mitosporidium daphniae, Amoeboaphelidium occidentale and Nuclearia simplex) were analysed. While the insertion of repeats is responsible for long ITS in other eukaryotes, the increased size of the sequences analysed herein seems rather due to the presence of introns in ITS-1 or ITS-2. The identified insertions can be folded in secondary structures according to group I intron models, and they cluster within introns in conserved core-based phylogeny. In addition, for Mitosporidium, Amoeboaphelidium and Nuclearia, more conventional ITS-2 structures can be deduced once spacer introns are removed. Sequences of five shark species were also analysed for their structure and included in phylogeny because of unpublished work reporting introns in their ITS, obtaining congruent results. Overall, the data presented herein indicate that spacer regions may contain introns.","[Corsaro, Daniele; Venditti, Danielle] CHLAREAS, 12 Rue Maconnais, F-54500 Vandoeuvre Les Nancy, France","Corsaro, D (corresponding author), CHLAREAS, 12 Rue Maconnais, F-54500 Vandoeuvre Les Nancy, France.",corsaro@gmx.fr,,"Corsaro, Daniele/0000-0002-1754-1546",,,,47,1,1,3,4,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0172-8083,1432-0983,,CURR GENET,Curr.

Thirty-eight percent of tiger sharks had at least one fisheries interaction resulting in retained hooks during the 8-year observation period. Both stainless-steel and corrodible hooks had a retention half-life of less than 1 year, and all corrodible hooks were shed within 2.5 years whereas firmly embedded stainless-steel hooks persisted for at least 7.6 years and are potentially retained for the lifetime of the shark. The presence of residual hooks and trailing line did not impact tiger shark growth suggesting that sharks were able to feed normally despite trailing gear. However, only a single internally-hooked sharks trailing line was observed suggesting their survival may perhaps be lower than externally-hooked individuals. Hook-retention data obtained from this study could be extrapolated to other warm water shark species that are difficult to observe in their natural habitats (e.g. oceanic whitetip shark, Carcharhinus longimanus).","[Begue, Michel; Clua, Eric; Siu, Gilles] UPVD, PSL, Labex CORAIL, USR 3278,CNRS,EPHE,CRIOBE, BP 1013, F-98729 Moorea, French Polynesi, France; [Meyer, Carl] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Hawaii Inst Marine Biol, POB 1346, Kaneohe, HI 96744 USA","Meyer, C (corresponding author), Univ Hawaii Manoa, Hawaii Inst Marine Biol, POB 1346, Kaneohe, HI 96744 USA.",carlm@hawaii.edu,"Clua, Eric/D-7820-2013","Clua, Eric/0000-0001-7629-2685","Labex CORAIL, France [KEY-TIGER/2018-0810SP]","The shark photos were taken and analysed under the special permit from the Environment department of French Polynesia ref. 5129/MCE/ENV of 22 June 2016.

However, very few studies in the primary literature have quantified the effects of various TED design aspects affecting the escape of elasmobranchs. Data collected by observers on board commercial trawlers operating in Australia's northern prawn fishery (NPF) during 2001 were re-examined to quantify the effect of TEDs on catches of various elasmobranchs. During this sampling, a total of 6204 elasmobranchs were caught from 1440 net trawls. The 34 species identified, from 15 families and four taxonomic orders, were dominated by small carcharhinids (n = 2160, median total length = 75 cm) and dasyatids (n = 2030, median disc width = 24 cm). The TEDs assessed significantly reduced the numbers of large elasmobranchs caught: increasing fish size was found to result in higher escape for all taxonomic orders. Further, top-shooter TEDs increased the escape of Carcharhiniformes, while bottom-shooter TEDs facilitated greater escape of Myliobatiformes. Grid orientation had no effect on the escape of Orectolobiformes or Rhinopristiformes. Decreasing bar space was found to increase the escape of only one species, the Australian blacktip shark (Carcharhinus tilstoni). The TEDs facilitated the escape of several species of conservation interest including the globally endangered scalloped hammerhead (Sphyrna lewini) and zebra shark (Stegostoma fasciatum). However, the rostrum of the narrow sawfish (Anoxypristis cuspidata) inhibited the escape of this globally important species. Fishery-specific research is required to determine the appropriate TED bar spaces that reduce catches of elasmobranchs while minimising the loss of commercially important species.","[Campbell, Matthew J.; Courtney, Anthony J.] Agrisci Queensland, Ecosci Precinct, Queensland Dept Agr & Fisheries, GPO Box 267, Brisbane, Qld 4001, Australia; [Tonks, Mark L.; Miller, Margaret] CSIRO, QLD Biosci Precinct, Oceans & Atmosphere, Bldg 80,Serv Rd, St Lucia, Qld 4067, Australia; [Brewer, David T.] David Brewer Consulting, 91 Raeburn St, Manly West, Qld 4179, Australia; [Campbell, Matthew J.; Simpfendorfer, Colin A.] James Cook Univ, Ctr Sustainable Trop Fisheries & Aquaculture, 1 James Cook Dr, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia","Campbell, MJ (corresponding author), Ecosci Precinct, Queensland Dept Agr & Fisheries, GPO Box 267, Brisbane, Qld 4001, Australia.",matthew.campbell@daf.qld.gov.au,"Miller, Margaret J/D-2201-2011; Brewer, David/AAU-9486-2020","Miller, Margaret J/0000-0001-7798-7868; ",Fisheries Research and Development Corporation (FRDC Project) [2000/173]; Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO)Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO),"The authors would like to sincerely thank the observers who collected the data during long nights at sea: Ben Bird, Quinton Dell, Chris Gough and Reuben Gregor.

While perturbing an input parameter, e.g. a cross section in a given energy range, the resulting perturbation to the effective cross section, e.g. multigroup cross section, can be expressed as the sum of an explicit and implicit component. The implicit term stems from changes in the neutron flux resulting from the cross section perturbation. This effect is neglected when using the standard perturbation theory methodology, even though its importance for uncertainty quantification is reported in the literature. The objectives of the paper are, in view of further enhancing Shark-X, to review a set of existing methods and to propose novel methodologies in order to accurately take the implicit effect into account in the resonance shielding treatment of CASMO-5; as well as to assess the importance of the new tool for typical LWR applications. Amongst the methods considered, those based on an equivalence in dilution allow perturbing the group-averaged cross sections without having to solve the slowing down problem in conjunction with the perturbed point-wise cross sections. However, such methods are found to show only limited improvements as compared to the standard perturbed self-shielded cross sections determined neglecting the implicit effect. As a result, a simpler approach based on the pre-determination of perturbation factors is adopted and implemented into Shark-X and CASMO-5. The new implementation is successfully tested and verified by comparing k-inf sensitivity coefficients computed with Shark-X with those from a Monte-Carlo reference solution, and this for a range of simple homogeneous mixtures as well as for LWR pin cells and lattices. Finally, the paper demonstrates through simple considerations, that the magnitude of the implicit effect is related to the energy group structure in the resolved resonance region, which might be specific to the code used to compute the sensitivity coefficients. The finer is the energy mesh; the smaller is also the impact of the implicit effect, and as such the necessity for a specific treatment. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Small dermal injuries (8 mm biopsy) closed by 22 days post wounding with a decrease in haematocrit. High CO2 exposure (Delta pH = 1.4) did not influence healing rate or haematocrit. Combined, these data provide evidence that minimally invasive scientific procedures have short-term impacts on elasmobranch fishes even during exposure to a chronic stressor. Therefore, wound healing rates may not be strongly impacted by ocean acidification (Delta pH = 0.4).","[Bouyoucos, Ian A.; Shipley, Oliver N.; Brooks, Edward J.] Cape Eleuthera Inst, Shark Res & Conservat Program, Eleuthera, Bahamas; [Jones, Emily; Mandelman, John W.] New England Aquarium, Anderson Cabot Ctr Ocean Life, Boston, MA USA; [Shipley, Oliver N.] SUNY Stony Brook, Sch Marine & Atmospher Sci, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA","Bouyoucos, IA (corresponding author), James Cook Univ, Australian Res Council, Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia.; Bouyoucos, IA (corresponding author), Univ Perpignan, PSL Res Univ, EPHE UPVD CNRS, USR CRIOBE 3278, Perpignan, France.",ian.bouyoucos@my.jcu.edu.au,"Bouyoucos, Ian/E-6392-2017","Bouyoucos, Ian/0000-0002-4267-1043",Cape Eleuthera Foundation,"This study was funded by an anonymous research gift to E.J.B. and J.W.M., and the Cape Eleuthera Foundation",,22,0,0,3,3,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-1112,1095-8649,,J FISH BIOL,J.

In Mexico's Gulf of California and Baja California Peninsula (GCBP), marine ecosystems support tourism activities in many communities, but to date there have been no region-wide studies to estimate their benefits or identify key species. Based on data collected in this study, each year nature-based marine tourism in the GCBP results in 896,000 visits, US$518 million in expenditures and at least 3,575 direct jobs from formal operations. In interviews with operators, over 40 species groups were named as important; sea lions, whale sharks, whales, and marlin were the highest ranked, highlighting the importance of ecosystem-wide health for nature-based tourism sustainability. Local employment and the ability to make economic and conservation goals compatible were noted by operators as significant opportunities provided by nature-based marine tourism; challenges included pollution and declines in ecosystem health, a lack of infrastructure, poor resource management policies, and high operating costs. As nature-based marine tourism expands, a wider transition to true ecotourism, a focus on equitable benefits and collaboration between stakeholders and a cross-scale and ecosystem approach to management will be vital for achieving potential sustainable social, ecological and economic benefits.","[Cisneros-Montemayor, Andres M.] Univ British Columbia, Inst Oceans & Fisheries, Nippon Fdn Ocean Nexus Program, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Townsel, Amanda] Irvine Sci Commun, Santa Fe, CA USA; [Gonzales, Claire M.] Blue Latitudes, San Diego, CA USA; [Navarro-Holm, Estrella E.] BIG BLUE Freediving Ocean, La Paz, Mexico; [Salorio-Zuniga, Teresa] Univ Autonoma Baja California Sul, Turismo Alternat, La Paz, Bcs, Mexico; [Johnson, Andrew F.] Heriot Watt Univ, Inst Life & Earth Sci, MarFishEco Fisheries Consultants, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland","Cisneros-Montemayor, AM (corresponding author), Univ British Columbia, Inst Oceans & Fisheries, Nippon Fdn Ocean Nexus Program, Vancouver, BC, Canada.",a.cisneros@oceans.ubc.ca,,"Cisneros-Montemayor, Andres M./0000-0002-4132-5317; Frederick Johnson, Andrew/0000-0003-3365-8768","Nature Conservancy [P104449, 103823-MNCA OCEANS WEA]; National Science Foundation (USA)National Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-1632648]","The Nature Conservancy, Grant/Award Number: Project #P104449, Activity #103823-MNCA OCEANS WEA; National Science Foundation (USA), Grant/Award Number: DEB-1632648",,71,0,0,12,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0165-0203,1477-8947,,NAT RESOUR FORUM,Nat.

To quantify how disturbances interact with long-term directional changes (sea-level rise, freshwater restoration), we studied 17 yr of monthly dissolved organic carbon (DOC), total nitrogen (TN), and phosphorus (TP) concentrations and bacterioplankton productivity across freshwater-to-marine estuary gradients exposed to multiple disturbance events (e.g., droughts, fire, hurricanes, and low-temperature anomalies) and long-term increases in water levels. By studying two neighboring drainages that differ in hydrologic connectivity, we additionally tested how disturbance legacies are shaped by hydrologic connectivity. We predicted that disturbance events would interact with long-term increases in water levels in freshwater and marine ecosystems to increase spatiotemporal similarity (i.e., synchrony) of organic matter, nutrients, and microbial activities. Wetlands along the larger, deeper, and tidally influenced Shark River Slough (SRS) drainage had higher and more variable DOC, TN, and TP concentrations than wetlands along the smaller, shallower, tidally restricted Taylor River Slough/Panhandle (TS/Ph) drainage. Along SRS, DOC concentrations declined with proximity to coast, and increased in magnitude and variability following drought and flooding in 2015 and a hurricane in 2017. Along TS/Ph, DOC concentrations varied by site (higher in marine than freshwater wetlands) but not year. In both drainages, increases in TN from upstream freshwater marshes occurred following fire in 2008 and droughts in 2010 and 2015, whereas downstream increases in TP occurred with coastal storm surge from hurricanes in 2005 and 2017. Decreases in DOC:TN and DOC:TP were explained by increased TN and TP. Increases in bacterioplankton productivity occurred throughout both drainages following low-temperature events (2010 and 2011) and a hurricane (2017). Long-term TN and TP concentrations and bacterioplankton productivity were correlated (r > 0.5) across a range of sampling distances (1-50 km), indicating spatiotemporal synchrony. DOC concentrations were not synchronized across space or time. Our study advances disturbance ecology theory by illustrating how disturbance events interact with long-term environmental changes and hydrologic connectivity to determine the magnitude and extent of disturbance legacies. Understanding disturbance legacies will enhance prediction and enable more effective management of rapidly changing ecosystems.","[Kominoski, John S.; Gaiser, Evelyn E.; Castaneda-Moya, Edward; Lee, Dong Yoon; Marazzi, Luca; Sola, Andres; Stumpf, Sandro; Travieso, Rafael; Troxler, Tiffany G.] Florida Int Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Miami, FL 33199 USA; [Kominoski, John S.; Gaiser, Evelyn E.; Castaneda-Moya, Edward; Dessu, Shimelis B.; Lee, Dong Yoon; Marazzi, Luca; Sola, Andres; Stumpf, Sandro; Travieso, Rafael; Troxler, Tiffany G.] Florida Int Univ, Inst Environm, Southeast Environm Res Ctr, Miami, FL 33199 USA; [Davis, Stephen E.] Everglades Fdn, Palmetto Bay, FL 33157 USA; [Dessu, Shimelis B.] Florida Int Univ, Dept Earth & Environm, Miami, FL 33199 USA; [Julian, Paul, II] Univ Florida, Whitney Lab Marine Biosci, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Rivera-Monroy, Victor H.] Louisiana State Univ, Coll Coast & Environm, Dept Oceanog & Coastal Sci, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA; [Stingl, Ulrich] Univ Florida, Inst Food & Agr Sci, Davie, FL 33314 USA; [Surratt, Donatto] Natl Pk Serv, Boynton Beach, FL 33437 USA","Kominoski, JS (corresponding author), Florida Int Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Miami, FL 33199 USA.; Kominoski, JS (corresponding author), Florida Int Univ, Inst Environm, Southeast Environm Res Ctr, Miami, FL 33199 USA.",jkominos@fiu.edu,,"Castaneda, Edward/0000-0001-7759-4351; Kominoski, John/0000-0002-0978-3326","National Science Foundation through the Florida Coastal Everglades Long Term Ecological Research (FCE-LTER) program [DEB-1832229, DEB-1237517, DBI-0620409, DEB-9910514]; Everglades National Park (ENP); South Florida Water Management District (SFWMD)","This research was supported by the National Science Foundation through the Florida Coastal Everglades Long Term Ecological Research (FCE-LTER) program under Cooperative Agreements #DEB-1832229, #DEB-1237517, #DBI-0620409, and #DEB-9910514 and multiple contracts and Cooperative Agreements with Everglades National Park (ENP) and the South Florida Water Management District (SFWMD).
