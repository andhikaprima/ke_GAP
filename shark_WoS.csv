However, the sustainability of the grouper resources has not been managed effectively and environmentally friendly. This study aims to determine the susceptibility level of red and black groupers in the research area based on the productivity and susceptibility analysis. This study was conducted from May to November 2018, in which the data were collected from the grouper's fishermen using hand line with simple random methods as a fishing gear in Wanci and Tomia islands of Wakatobi. Based on the collected data, productivity attribute of red groupers is at 1.8, and the susceptibility level is at 2.08, while the black groupers have 1.7 for the productivity attributes and 2.0 for their susceptibility level. Based on the susceptibility index of both types of fish, it indicates that red groupers are at 1.61, and the black groupers' susceptibility level is at 1.64. This study implies that the susceptibility index of red and black groupers at Wakatobi National Park is moderate which means that the groupers as a matter of fact experience fishing pressure. Therefore, some sustainable efforts to effectively and environmentally friendly manage the fishing activity in the island need to be done in the future. (c) 2020 GJESM.

There is a lack of fisheries-independent data on the demographics of many species, particularly those inhabiting deeper waters. The common sawshark (Pristiophorus cirratus) is a benthic-associated shark endemic to southeastern Australia that has been fished for over 90 years. Despite regular landings, little is known about their lifespan. To assess the age of P. cirratus, we first assessed their vertebral morphology to determine the best method for band pair elucidation. Based on morphology, vertebrae located in the post-branchial region were identified as the largest and least variable for band pair analysis. A total of eight different age-determination methods were then applied to shark vertebrae from this region to test the viability of traditional and nontraditional techniques in elucidating band pairs. Band pairs were indeterminable across all treatments. This research calls for further work into age validation and development of novel techniques to accurately age sawsharks.",,,,,"Williamson, Jane/0000-0003-3627-4508; Burke, Patrick/0000-0002-7217-0215",,,,,,,,,,,,0165-7836,1872-6763,,,,NOV,2020,231,,,,,,,,105706,10.1016/j.fishres.2020.105706,,,,,,,WOS:000571380300007,,,,,,

A.; Smith, Caroline L.",,,Emerging roles of melanocortin receptor accessory proteins (MRAP and MRAP2) in physiology and pathophysiology,GENE,,,,,,,,,,,,"Melanocortin-2 receptor accessory protein (MRAP) has an unusual dual topology and influences the expression, localisation, signalling and internalisation of the melanocortin receptor 2 (MC2); the adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) receptor. Mutations in MRAP are associated with familial glucocorticoid deficiency type-2 and evidence is emerging of the importance of MRAP in adrenal development and ACTH signalling. Human MRAP has two functional splice variants: MRAP-alpha and MRAP-beta, unlike MRAP-beta, MRAP-alpha has little expression in brain but is highly expressed in ovary. MRAP2, identified through whole human genome sequence analysis, has approximately 40% sequence homology to MRAP. MRAP2 facilitates MC2 localisation to the cell surface but not ACTH signalling. MRAP and MRAP2 have been found to regulate the surface expression and signalling of all melanocortin receptors (MC1-5). Additionally, MRAP2 moderates the signalling of the G-protein coupled receptors (GCPRs): orexin, prokineticin and GHSR1 alpha; the ghrelin receptor. Whilst MRAP appears to be mainly involved in glucocorticoid synthesis, an important role is emerging for MRAP2 in regulating appetite and energy homeostasis. Transgenic models indicate the importance of MRAP in adrenal gland formation. Like MC3R and MC4R knockout mice, MRAP2 knockout mice have an obese phenotype. In vitro studies indicate that MRAP2 enhances the MC3 and MC4 response to the agonist alpha MSH, which, like ACTH, is produced through precursor polypeptide proopiomelanocortin (POMC) cleavage. Analysis of cohorts of individuals with obesity have revealed several MRAP2 genetic variants with loss of function mutations which are causative of monogenic hyperphagic obesity with hyperglycaemia and hypertension. MRAP2 may also be associated with female infertility. This review summarises current knowledge of MRAP and MRAP2, their influence on GPCR signalling, and focusses on pathophysiology, particularly familial glucocorticoid deficiency type-2 and obesity.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0378-1119,1879-0038,,,,OCT 5,2020,757,,,,,,,,144949,10.1016/j.gene.2020.144949,,,,,,,WOS:000564684100006,32679290,,,,,

The polyphyodont system is considered the ancestral condition of the gnathostome dentition. Despite this shared regenerative ability, sharks and rays exhibit dramatic interspecific variation in their tooth morphology. Ray (batoidea) teeth typically constitute crushing pads of flattened teeth, whereas shark teeth are pointed, multi-cuspid units. Although recent research has addressed the molecular development of the shark dentition, little is known about that of the ray. Furthermore, how dental diversity within the elasmobranch lineage is achieved remains unknown. Here, we examine dental development and regeneration in two Batoid species: the thornback skate (Raja clavata) and the little skate (Leucoraja erinacea). Using in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry, we examine the expression of a core gnathostome dental gene set during early development of the skate dentition and compare it to development in the shark. Elasmobranch tooth development is highly conserved, with sox2 likely playing an important role in the initiation and regeneration of teeth. Alterations to conserved genes expressed in an enamel knot-like signalling centre may explain the morphological diversity of elasmobranch teeth, thereby enabling sharks and rays to occupy diverse dietary and ecological niches.",,,,,"Dillard, Wesley/0000-0002-0803-0509",,,,,,,,,,,,0012-1606,1095-564X,,,,OCT 1,2020,466,1-2,,,,,59,72,,10.1016/j.ydbio.2020.07.014,,,,,,,WOS:000571813600006,32791054,,,,,

New technologies are being trialled in New South Wales, on Australia's east coast, to accommodate the community demand for increased beach-user protection that does not harm marine wildlife. Drones (or unmanned aerial vehicles), are one of a suite of potential tools that can address both these demands. We released an online survey to assess beach-user perceptions and attitudes toward drones on NSW beaches as a shark surveillance tool. From 439 respondents, we found the use of drones on coastal beaches was accepted by the majority of people surveyed (88%) due to perceptions of reduced impact on sharks, and the relatively low cost. Drone surveillance was also the preferred approach for bather protection overall. Arguably the most vulnerable beach-user group for a shark bite incident, surfers, claimed the highest level of awareness of the use of drones for shark surveillance, but also indicated lower confidence in their utility compared to other groups.

Mercury contamination could represent an additional threat to shark populations that are declining worldwide. Here we measured total mercury, carbon and nitrogen isotopes, as well as mercury isotopes, in two co-occurring shark species (the bull shark Carcharhinus leucas and the tiger shark Galeocerdo cuvier) and their potential prey from a coastal ecosystem of the western Indian Ocean (La Reunion Island). Our primary goals were to (i) determine the main trophic Hg sources for sharks and (ii) better characterize their diet composition and foraging habitat. Hg isotope signatures (Delta Hg-199 and delta Hg-202) of shark prey suggested that bull sharks were exposed to methylmercury (MeHg) produced in offshore epipelagic waters, while tiger sharks were exposed to offshore mesopelagic MeHg with additional microbial transformation in slope sediments. Delta Hg-199 values efficiently traced the ecology of the two predators, demonstrating that bull sharks targeted coastal prey in shallow waters while tiger sharks were mainly foraging on mesopelagic species in the deeper waters of the island slope. Unexpectedly, we found a positive shift in delta Hg-202 (>1 parts per thousand) between sharks and their prey, leading to high delta Hg-202 values in the two shark species (e.g. 1.91 +/- 0.52 parts per thousand in bull sharks). This large shift in delta Hg-202 indicates that sharks may display strong MeHg demethylation abilities, possibly reflecting evolutionary pathways for mitigating their MeHg contamination.

This has led to speculation that unsustainable fishing of smaller shark species may have displaced white sharks by removing their primary food source. Most of the catch from these fisheries is exported to Australia to supply the domestic 'fish and chips' market so a link has been made between the disappearance of South Africa's white sharks and shark consumption in Australia. As cooked seafood is not properly labelled in Australia, consumers cannot readily distinguish between sustainable and non-sustainable seafood. Hence, a highly promoted campaign was recently initiated to encourage Australians to stop eating 'fish and chips' and as such save South Africa's white sharks. However, most of the consumed shark in Australia is sourced from sustainable domestic fisheries and encouraging Australian consumers to stop eating 'fish and chips' would not help South African white sharks as it would simply displace the issue. It would not address any South African sustainability concerns and would negatively impact a legitimate and sustainable Australian industry.

This study evaluated different fisheries management strategies for shortfin mako and blue shark in the Atlantic Ocean from the stakeholders' perspective. Personal interviews were conducted with Spanish fishermen and surveys were sent to scientists and non-governmental organizations (NGOs). Local Ecological Knowledge was considered to be useful as fishermen possess unique expertise based on their continued interaction with the species and environment. Interviews allowed understanding the fishermen's perception on variations of stock abundance, distribution patterns, size of capture and seasonal fluctuations for both species. SWOT (Strength, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats)-analysis was used to study the different management measures. Main management strategies proposed by all stakeholders to reduce the bycatch of both species were spatial-temporal closure, minimum size and quotas.

These models are commonly fit using Bayesian methods, with the prior for the intrinsic rate of growth (r) set based on the results of a demographic analysis. We used simulations based on blue shark Prionace glauca in the Indian Ocean to evaluate the performances of estimation methods that reflect different assumptions regarding the form of the production function and the basis for the prior for r. Nine age-structured operating models reflected different levels of productivity (determined by the steepness of stock-recruitment relationship [h = 0.4; h = 0.6; h = 0.79] and the pattern of historical catches (increasing, stable and declining). As expected, estimation performance was poorer for greater extents of observation error, and better when there was more 'contrast' in biomass. However, the PTPM usually performed worse than the LPM, particularly for high levels of observation error. Surprisingly, the prior for r with mean set to of the estimate of the r inferred from the demographic analysis combined with the LPM performed best for an increasing catch series (a one-way trip in biomass) and high uncertainty in the abundance index. Additional analyses revealed that the poor performance of the PTPM was due to the additional estimation variance associated with the estimation of the shape parameter, while the better performance for the 'wrong prior' occurred because the Schaefer model assumes a linear relationship between growth rate and population depletion whereas an age-structured model implies a non-linear relationship. Given poor data, r is not updated much, leading the LPM to overestimate productivity. This paper highlights the dangers of naively integrating demographic analysis into Bayesian surplus production models, and the value of including simulation analysis as a part of the standard set of diagnostics used when selecting an estimation method on which to base stock assessments. We also recommend use of JABBA-Select or a prior for r from a demographic analysis that accounts for the status of the population when the data on which the demographic parameters are based as well as the form of the production function.",,,,,"Punt, Andre/0000-0001-8489-2488",,,,,,,,,,,,0165-7836,1872-6763,,,,OCT,2020,230,,,,,,,,105636,10.1016/j.fishres.2020.105636,,,,,,,WOS:000553385900014,,,,,,

Few fisheries-independent, extended time-series data exist for coastal shark species in the northwest Atlantic Ocean or Caribbean outside of the United States. A decades old dataset comprised of standardized longline surveys provided us with the opportunity to characterize diversity and evaluate changes in the relative abundance of sharks in the eastern Bahamas between 1979-1990 and 2011-2013. Caribbean reef sharks Carcharhinus perezi and tiger sharks Galeocerdo cuvier were the two most commonly captured species throughout the survey and were the only two species analyzed in detail. For both species, sex ratios favored females. Using Bayesian generalized linear models, we found that Caribbean reef shark catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) exhibited a positive relationship with year and temperature, while size exhibited no relationship with year and a negative relationship with temperature. There was no relationship between tiger shark CPUE and year but there was a positive relationship between size and year.

It belongs to Lower Tf1 Letter Stage (based on larger benthic foraminifers) of the Burdigalian, within interval 19-16 Ma, and is the only Miocene unit on the platform. The Trealla Limestone here is coeval to the deeper water lower part of the much thicker Trealla Limestone in the Exmouth Sub-basin to the northwest. A seagrass-meadow depositional environment is indicated by most of the studied microfacies based on comparisons with modern sediment composition and foraminiferal assemblages found in innermost shelf seagrass banks between 23 degrees S and 32 degrees S on the present Western Australian coast. Some levels in the Trealla Limestone on the platform (e.g. with abundant miliolid foraminifers, and absence of coral debris) probably were deposited in and around dense seagrass meadows similar to those present today in the metahaline (40-55 ppt salinity) reaches of Shark Bay; whereas other levels (e.g. coral floatstone) were deposited under normal-marine conditions. Based on comparisons with modern carbonate sediment and biota in the region, the biogenic composition of the Trealla Limestone on the platform suggests winter minimum sea-surface temperatures within the range of 17-22 degrees C. The Nullabor Limestone in the Eucla Basin, at 10 degrees further south on the southern Australian margin, is similar, at least in part, in composition and age to the Trealla Limestone on the Southern Carnarvon Platform. Both may have been deposited during a Burdigalian sea-level rise, and during part of the Miocene climate optimum recognized elsewhere. Sediment composition and foraminiferal assemblages (including epiphytic types) found in the Trealla and Nullabor limestones are similar to those in the modern seagrass banks of the region. This suggests that seagrasses similar to the extensive Posidonia and Amphibolus stands, which are dominant today between 25 degrees S and 35 degrees S along the Western Australian coast, were widespread during the Burdigalian.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0031-0182,1872-616X,,,,OCT 1,2020,555,,,,,,,,109846,10.1016/j.palaeo.2020.109846,,,,,,,WOS:000552137900008,,,,,,

Embryo muscle tissue had significantly higher concentrations of most trace elements when compared to mothers, with the exception of Hg. Embryo liver accumulated more nonessential elements than muscle (n = 7 vs. 0, respectively), while the Se:Hg molar ratio was >1 in liver and muscle of both mothers and embryos. Livers of embryos were moderately enriched in delta C-13 and delta N-15 when compared to that of their mother. Negative correlations were observed between embryo body length and delta C-13 and trace elements concentrations. We conclude that mothers offload a large portion of all essential elements and Al, As and Pb to their young and that the isotopic fractionation of embryos reflects maternal diet and habitat occupied, with delta C-13 diluted with embryonic growth. We also show that muscle and liver accumulate trace elements at different rates relative to the body length of embryos.

Differences in whole body shape, swimming style, and physiological parameters have previously been linked to varied habitat uses. Pectoral fin morphology has been used to taxonomically classify species and hypotheses on the functional differences in shape are noted throughout the literature; however, there are limited comparative datasets that quantify external and skeletal morphology. Further, fins were previously categorized into two discrete groups based on the amount of skeletal support present: (a) aplesodic, where less than half of the fin is supported and (b) plesodic where greater than half of the fin is supported. These discrete classifications have been used to phylogenetically place species, though the methodology of classification is infrequently described. In this study, we sampled fins from 18 species, 6 families, and 3 orders, which were also grouped into five ecomorphotype classifications. We examined the external morphology, extent of skeletal support, and cross-sectional shape of individual cartilaginous elements. Using phylogenetic comparative methods, we show that fin shape does not differ significantly between ecomorphotypes, suggesting there may be some mechanical constraint. However, we find that the internal anatomy of the fin does vary significantly between ecomorphotypes, especially the extent and distribution of calcification of skeletal support, suggesting that the superficial similarity of fin shapes across ecomorphotypes may belie differences in function. Finally, we find that a number of morphological variables such as number of radials, radial calcification and shape, and fin taper all correlate with the extent of skeletal support. Within these morphospaces, we also describe that some orders/families tend to occupy certain areas with limited overlap. While we demonstrate that there is some mechanical constraint limiting external variations in shark pectoral fin morphology, there are compounding differences in skeletal anatomy that occur within ecomorphotypes which we propose may affect function.",,,,,"Porter, Marianne/0000-0002-3622-7114",,,,,,,,,,,,0362-2525,1097-4687,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1002/jmor.21269,,SEP 2020,,,,,WOS:000571907300001,32965713,,,,,

The filtering characteristics are further improved by incorporating circular complementary split-ring resonator (CCSRR) on the ground plane. The proposed lowpass filtering antenna is obtained by integrating the lowpass filter with a super wideband (SWB) monopole antenna and experimentally validated with the measured reflection coefficient as <-10 dB in 0.67 to 4.15 GHz (69.25%). In this operating spectrum, the radiation pattern characteristics of the filtering antenna is identically stable and the passband average gain is >4.45 dBi. Further, the prototype filtering antenna bandwidth and radiation characteristics are analyzed in housing effects. The filtering antenna can be conveniently printed along with the existing printed circuit board or it can be located inside the shark fin housing thereby eliminating the need for a dedicated location in vehicular communications.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1096-4290,1099-047X,,,,,,,,,,,,,,e22452,10.1002/mmce.22452,,SEP 2020,,,,,WOS:000571505300001,,,,,,

Y.",,,When large marine predators feed on fisheries catches: Global patterns of the depredation conflict and directions for coexistence,FISH AND FISHERIES,,,,,,,,,,,,"The sustainable mitigation of human-wildlife conflicts has become a major societal and environmental challenge globally. Among these conflicts, large marine predators feeding on fisheries catches, a behaviour termed depredation, has emerged concomitantly with the expansion of the world's fisheries. Depredation poses threats to both the socio-economic viability of fisheries and species conservation, stressing the need for mitigation. This review synthesizes the extent and socio-ecological impacts of depredation by sharks and marine mammals across the world, and the various approaches used to minimize it. Depredation was reported in 214 fisheries between 1979 and 2019 (70% post-2000) and affected fleets from 44 countries, in all sectors (commercial, artisanal and recreational), and in all major fishing techniques (nets, traps and hook-and-lines). A total of 68 predator species were involved in depredation (20 odontocetes, 21 pinnipeds and 27 sharks), and most (73%) were subject to either by-catch and/or retaliatory killing from fishers when interacting with gear. Impacts on fishers were primarily associated with catch losses and gear damage but often lacked assessments. Deterrence was a major mitigation approach but also the least effective. Gear modifications or behavioural adaptation by fishers were more promising. This review highlights the need for improved monitoring, and interdisciplinary and integrated research to quantify the determinants and impacts of depredation in the socio-ecological dimension. More importantly, as the conflict is likely to escalate, efforts directed towards changing perceptions and integrating knowledge through adaptive co-management are raised as key directions towards coexistence between fisheries and large marine predators.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1467-2960,1467-2979,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1111/faf.12504,,SEP 2020,,,,,WOS:000570766900001,,,,,,

Quadrants of San Andres and Providencia islands presented the highest richness with 16 species. Oceanic environments differed significantly in composition and abundance from the other four large areas evaluated. Northern banks were the most favorable environments for large-sized pelagic sharks while San Andres and Providencia Islands were for batoids; this difference could be due to the pelagic and benthic habits, respectively, and their relation with availability of substrate, food and sheltered areas. Our study confirmed that the Archipelago has at least 21% of the total richness of the northwestern Atlantic region, 43% of that of the Greater Caribbean and 49% of that registered in the Colombian Caribbean Coast, suggesting that the Archipelago is a potential richness hotspot in the Caribbean region.

Regular visits to landing sites in the south-eastern coastal region of Bangladesh were conducted to collect data on sawfish landings. A telephone reporting system was developed amongst shark traders and fishers, to facilitate immediate reporting of sawfish landings.

Cyclostomes, or modern jawless vertebrates, possess a rudimentary and superficial HBM lateral to the pharynx, whereas the HBM in jawed vertebrates is internalized and anteroposteriorly specified. Precursor cells of the HBM, marked by expression ofLbx1, originate from somites and undergo extensive migration before becoming innervated by the hypoglossal nerve. How the complex form of HBM arose in evolution is relevant to the establishment of the vertebrate body plan, but despite having long been assumed to be similar to that of limb muscles, modification of developmental mechanisms of HBM remains enigmatic. Results Here we characterize the expression ofLbxgenes in lamprey and hagfish (cyclostomes) and catshark (gnathostome; jawed vertebrates). We show that the expression patterns of the single cyclostomeLbxhomologue,Lbx-A, do not resemble the somitic expression of mammalianLbx1. Disruption ofLbx-Arevealed thatLjLbx-Ais required for the formation of both HBM and body wall muscles, likely due to the insufficient extension of precursor cells rather than to hindered muscle differentiation. Both homologues ofLbxin the catshark were expressed in the somitic muscle primordia, unlike in amniotes. During catshark embryogenesis,Lbx2is expressed in the caudal HBM as well as in the abdominal rectus muscle, similar to lampreyLbx-A, whereasLbx1marks the rostral HBM and pectoral fin muscle. Conclusions We conclude that the vertebrate HBM primarily emerged as a specialized somatic muscle to cover the pharynx, and the anterior internalized HBM of the gnathostomes is likely a novelty added rostral to the cyclostome-like HBM, for which duplication and functionalization ofLbxgenes would have been a prerequisite.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1741-7007,,,,SEP 9,2020,18,1,,,,,,,120,10.1186/s12915-020-00851-y,,,,,,,WOS:000571678400002,32907560,,,,,

The obtained data, along with a comparison to the composition of conodont apatite, show the presence of a few generations of diagenetic phosphate phases. A thin, outer layer of the spines is composed of very early diagenetic phosphate, which incrusted the original cuticle layer contributing to the preservation of an original shape and structural details of the fossils. This process can be linked to the 'Orsten'-type phosphatization mainly known from Lower Palaeozoic strata. Successive phosphate generations are observed within the middle and inner layers as well as internal cavities of the spines.

Chondrichthyans (sharks and their kin) are the living sister group of osteichthyans and have primarily cartilaginous endoskeletons, long considered the ancestral condition for all jawed vertebrates (gnathostomes). The absence of bone in modern jawless fishes and the absence of endochondral ossification in early fossil gnathostomes appear to lend support to this conclusion. Here we report the discovery of extensive endochondral bone inMinjinia turgenensis, a new genus and species of 'placoderm'-like fish from the Early Devonian (Pragian) of western Mongolia described using X-ray computed microtomography. The fossil consists of a partial skull roof and braincase with anatomical details providing strong evidence of placement in the gnathostome stem group. However, its endochondral space is filled with an extensive network of fine trabeculae resembling the endochondral bone of osteichthyans. Phylogenetic analyses place this new taxon as a proximate sister group of the gnathostome crown. These results provide direct support for theories of generalized bone loss in chondrichthyans. Furthermore, they revive theories of a phylogenetically deeper origin of endochondral bone and its absence in chondrichthyans as a secondary condition. Minjinia turgenensis, an Early Devonian fish, preserves anatomical details consistent with it being a stem gnathostome, but also endochondral bone similar to that of osteichthyans.

This study aims to provide the first detailed descriptions of intertidal pools, along with their hosted thrombolite and stromatolite structures, from Abu Dhabi, and to propose a model for their formation and evolution. It is proposed that the development of pools within the upper intertidal zone was initiated by localized erosion of the laminated microbial mats during high energy events. The removal of the protective mats permitted erosion of the underlying unconsolidated sediment to produce erosional scours that continued to develop to create the pools observed today. The margins of the newly-created submerged environment were colonized by a cyanobacteria dominated microbial community. The precipitation of aragonite cement, associated with the cyanobacteria, stabilized the pool walls and cemented the microbial communities to form stromatolitic and thrombolitic fabrics. Syndepositional cementation was further enhanced by the precipitation of marine cements as a result of evaporation-driven Ca(2+)and Mg(2+)supersaturation. Erosion behind and below the cemented pool wall eventually resulted in rim-collapse and the formation of the observed pool margin parallel thrombolite bands. Successive generations of lithification and erosion increased the area of the pool with the earliest thrombolites eroding and becoming increasingly isolated. In summary, the resultant microbialites developed through the complex interplay of erosion, abiotic early lithification and microbially-mediated processes, and represent a continuum between unlithified laminated microbial mats and domal microbialites. These features are most likely produced during a sea-level scenario of stillstand or transgression and, as such, may be useful as a diagnostic tool to elucidate the onset of transgression. The newly proposed model for stromatolite formation has significant implications for the recognition and interpretation of similar structures observed in the fossil record.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0037-0746,1365-3091,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1111/sed.12783,,SEP 2020,,,,,WOS:000566580400001,,,,,,

Several expeditions conducted between 2009 and 2018 explored the shallow and deep reefs of SPSPA using scuba, closed-circuit rebreathers, manned submersibles, baited remote underwater stereo-videos (stereo-BRUV) and fishing between 0 and 1050 m depth. These expeditions yielded 41 new records of fishes for SPSPA: 9 in open waters, 9 in shallow waters (0-30 m), 8 in mesophotic ecosystems (30-150 m) and 15 in deeper reefs (>150 m). Combined with literature records of adult pelagic, shallow and deep-reef species, as well as larvae, the database of the fish biodiversity for SPSPA currently comprises 225 species (169 recorded as adult fishes and 79 as larvae, with 23 species found in both stages). Most of them (112) are pelagic, 86 are reef-associated species and 27 are deep-water specialists. Species accumulation curves show that the number of fish species has not yet reached an asymptote. Whereas the number of species recorded in SPSPA is similar to that in other oceanic islands in the Atlantic Ocean, the proportion of shorefishes is relatively lower, and the endemism level is the third highest in the Atlantic. Twenty-nine species are listed as threatened with extinction. Observations confirm the paucity of top predators on shallow rocky reefs of the island, despite the presence of several pelagic shark species around SPSPA. Because all of the endemic species are reef associated, it is argued that the new marine-protected areas created by the Brazilian government do not ensure the protection and recovery of SPSPA's biodiversity because they allow exploitation of the most vulnerable species around the archipelago itself. This study suggests a ban on reef fish exploitation inside an area delimited by the 1000 m isobath around the islands (where all known endemics are concentrated) as the main conservation strategy to be included in the SPSPA management plan being prepared by the Brazilian government.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0022-1112,1095-8649,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1111/jfb.14484,,SEP 2020,,,,,WOS:000566343800001,32743800,,,,,

Oceanic whitetip sharks are large pelagic sharks distributed circumglobally and recent IUCN assessments classified them as critically endangered. Considering their vulnerability, we investigated the intraspecific diversity and genetic stock structure of oceanic whitetip shark,Carcharhinus longimanus, along the Indian coast using mitochondrial control region sequences so that viable management guidelines can be formulated in the Indian Ocean region. Population genetic analyses revealed a lack of significant genetic differentiation along the Indian coast indicating substantial gene flow and connectivity among populations. Comparisons of data of the present study with that of Atlantic Ocean regions indicated significant connectivity and gene flow between Indian and East Atlantic regions and a lack of connectivity between Indian and West Atlantic Ocean regions. Oceanic whitetip sharks have substantial capacity for oceanic migration resulting in the mixing of gene pools. Despite these capabilities, overfishing is one of the major drivers of population decline worldwide, resulting in severe fragmentation of populations. Based on the results of the present study, this species can be managed as a single stock along the Indian coast. Further co-management measures along with countries bordering East Atlantic coast can also be devised. Management should consider a complete or seasonal ban of the fishery in addition to restrictions in gear types.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1867-1616,1867-1624,,,,SEP 5,2020,50,5,,,,,,,78,10.1007/s12526-020-01104-5,,,,,,,WOS:000566078200001,,,,,,

Such extrapolations are particularly risky when allometry is present. The extinct giant shark dagger Otodus megalodon is known almost exclusively from fossilised teeth. Estimates of dagger O. megalodon body size have been made from its teeth, using the great white shark (Carcharodon carcharias) as the only modern analogue. This can be problematic as the two species likely belong to different families, and the position of the dagger Otodus lineage within Lamniformes is unclear. Here, we infer dagger O. megalodon body dimensions based on anatomical measurements of five ecologically and physiologically similar extant lamniforms: Carcharodon carcharias, Isurus oxyrinchus, Isurus paucus, Lamna ditropis and Lamna nasus. We first assessed for allometry in all analogues using linear regressions and geometric morphometric analyses. Finding no evidence of allometry, we made morphological extrapolations to infer body dimensions of dagger O. megalodon at different sizes. Our results suggest that a 16 m dagger O. megalodon likely had a head similar to 4.65 m long, a dorsal fin similar to 1.62 m tall and a tail similar to 3.85 m high.

In this study, we identified elasmobranch CTCFL orthologs, and investigated its origin with the aid of a shark genome assembly improved by proximity-guided scaffolding. Our analysis employing evolutionary interpretation of syntenic gene location suggested an earlier timing of the gene duplication between CTCF and CTCFL than previously thought, that is, around the common ancestor of extant vertebrates. Also, our transcriptomic sequencing revealed a biased expression of the catshark CTCFL in the testis, suggesting the origin of the tissue-specific localization in mammals more than 400 million years ago.

In this work, the influence of the scales of fish on the laminar-to-turbulent transition in the boundary layer is investigated. Arrays of biomimetic fish scales in typical overlapping arrangements are placed on a flat plate in a low-turbulence laminar water channel. Transition to turbulence is triggered by controlled excitation of a Tollmien-Schlichting (TS) wave. It was found that the TS wave can be attenuated with scales on the plate which generate streamwise streaks. As a consequence, the transition location was substantially delayed in the downstream direction by 55% with respect to the uncontrolled reference case. This corresponds to a theoretical drag reduction of about 27%. We thus hypothesize that fish scales can stabilize the laminar boundary layer and prevent it from early transition, reducing friction drag.

In marine systems, artificial reefs are often deployed to restore degraded reefs or supplement existing reefs, but it remains unknown whether these interventions benefit large predators. Comparative field surveys of thirty artificial and natural reefs across similar to 200 km of the North Carolina, USA coast revealed large reef-associated predators were more dense on artificial than natural reefs. This pattern was associated with higher densities of transient predators (e.g. jacks, mackerel, barracuda, sharks) on artificial reefs, but not of resident predators (e.g., grouper, snapper). Further analyses revealed that this pattern of higher transient predator densities on artificial reefs related to reef morphology, as artificial reefs composed of ships hosted higher transient predator densities than concrete reefs. The strength of the positive association between artificial reefs and transient predators increased with a fundamental habitat trait-vertical extent. Taller artificial reefs had higher densities of transient predators, even when accounting for habitat area. A global literature review of high trophic level fishes on artificial and natural habitats suggests that the overall pattern of more predators on artificial habitats is generalizable. Together, these findings provide evidence that artificial habitats, especially those like sunken ships that provide high vertical structure, may support large predators.",,,,,"Paxton, Avery B./0000-0002-4871-9167",,,,,,,,,,,,1932-6203,,,,,SEP 2,2020,15,9,,,,,,,e0237374,10.1371/journal.pone.0237374,,,,,,,WOS:000568877100062,32877404,,,,,

Concretely, the Mediterranean Sea is facing a huge demand of resources and marine activities while hosting abundant and unique biodiversity. It is considered an important elasmobranch hotspot where seventy-two elasmobranch species are present in the basin. Despite the recognised importance of elasmobranchs as umbrella species, to date only a small number of marine protected areas have been designated towards their protection. The paucity of spatially-explicit abundance data on elasmobranchs often precludes the designation of these areas to protect these marine predators. Here, we aimed to identify marine areas to protect elasmobranch species by means of a systematic spatial planning approach. We first estimated the spatial distribution of five elasmobranch species (three sharks and two rays) in the western Mediterranean Sea and then applied Marxan decision support tools to find priority marine conservation areas. We found that the five elasmobranchs are distributed in coastal and slope areas of the southern waters of the study area while in the northern region they are abundant in the continental slope and towards offshore waters. Conservation priority areas were identified in the southern part of the western Mediterranean. Adding more complex cost layers and zoning to the analysis did not alter conservation priority areas, confirming such areas are highly consistent and highly important for elasmobranch protection.

Results: Marine environments provide excellent resources for the fabrication of these nanomaterials, because many marine organisms contain interesting trigger organic compounds that can be used as precursors. Herein, we synthesize multi-color emissive carbon dots (CDs) with an intrinsic photoluminescence quantum yield of 20.46%. These nanostructures were achieved through the one-step hydrothermal treatment of marine polysaccharide chondroitin sulfate, obtained from shark cartilage, in aqueous solution. Conclusions: We successfully demonstrate the low toxicity of our marine resource-derived CDs in zebrafish, and provide an initial assessment of their possible use as a bioimaging agent.

Implementing spatial management for conservation of hammerhead populations requires knowledge of temporal distribution patterns and habitat use, identification of essential habitat for protection, and quantification of interactions with human activities. There is little such information for the smooth hammerhead shark, Sphyrna zygaena. We used fin-mounted satellite tags to examine the movements and habitat use of juvenile smooth hammerheads, a demographic segment particularly threatened by exploitation. Six sharks were tagged off the US mid-Atlantic and tracked for 49-441 days (mean 187 +/- 136 days). Sharks consistently showed area-restricted movements within a summer core area in waters of the New York Bight and a winter core area off Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, with directed movements between them in autumn. There was high overlap of shark winter core area use and the Mid-Atlantic Shark Area (MASA) - a 7 month per year, bottom-longline fishery closure - indicating that this area closure offers seasonal reduction in fishing pressure for this species. Based on timing of shark movements and the MASA closure, protection for juvenile smooth hammerheads may be increased by beginning the closure period 1 month earlier than currently scheduled. Generalized additive mixed models revealed that area-restricted movements of sharks in their summer and winter core areas coincided with high primary productivity, and elevated sea surface temperature. Consistency in use of summer and winter core areas suggests that the coastal waters of the New York Bight and Cape Hatteras, North Carolina could be considered for Essential Fish Habitat designation for this species.

We developed and pilot tested a novel experimental approach to investigate whether repeated deployments of baited video systems in the same location could generate quantitative data on shark behavioural patterns, in the context of shark depredation (where sharks consume hooked fish). Specifically, we sought to WA whether repeated exposure to boats and food in the same location would lead to a change in the arrival time and first feeding time of sharks, over a short timescale. We used the Ningaloo Marine Park (NMP) in Western Australia, a location where higher shark depredation rates have been identified in consistently fished areas, as a case study. A modified Baited Remote Underwater Video (BRUV) system was repeatedly deployed at two fished sites and two sites within a no-take marine reserve in the NMP, over six consecutive days, to mimic repeated recreational fishing and the availability of hooked fish for sharks to depredate. This approach was designed to investigate and disentangle the potential role of changes in behaviour versus variation in shark abundance, as a mechanism for how and why shark depredation can occur. Here, we report preliminary results from this methodological approach, where time of arrival and time of first feeding declined markedly in the fished site over 6 days of BRUV deployments, compared to the control site in the no-take marine reserve. A greater number of individuals from four carcharhinid species were observed at the fished site, compared to only three individuals from two species in the no-take marine reserve. The preliminary results from pilot testing of this novel experimental approach suggest that, with further modifications to identify individual sharks, and a greater spatial and temporal replication of sampling, it may be possible to identify behavioural changes occurring in sharks in the context of shark depredation. Understanding this mechanism can bring important benefits for fishers and managers, as it can lead to modifications in fishing methods designed at reducing the occurrence of behavioural changes in sharks, and thus mitigating shark depredation.",,,,"McLean, Dianne/H-2449-2012","McLean, Dianne/0000-0002-0306-8348; Bond, Todd/0000-0001-6064-7015",,,,,,,,,,,,0022-0981,1879-1697,,,,SEP-OCT,2020,530,,,,,,,,151440,10.1016/j.jembe.2020.151440,,,,,,,WOS:000562582100002,,,,,,

The vast majority of NRs are triggered by binding to either endogenous (e.g. retinoic acid) or exogenous (e.g. xenobiotics) ligands, and their evolution and expansion is tightly linked to the function of endocrine systems. Importantly, they represent classic targets of physiological exploitation by endocrine disrupting chemicals. The NR gene repertoire in different lineages has been shaped by gene loss, duplication and mutation, denoting a dynamic evolutionary route. As the earliest diverging class of gnathostomes (jawed vertebrates), cartilaginous fishes offer an exceptional opportunity to address the early diversification of NR gene families and the evolution of the endocrine system in jawed vertebrates. Here we provide an exhaustive analysis into the NR gene composition in five elasmobranch (sharks and rays) and two holocephalan (chimaeras) species. For this purpose, we generated also a low coverage draft genome assembly of the chimaera small-eyed rabbitfish, Hydrolagus affinis. We show that cartilaginous fish retain an archetypal NR gene repertoire, similar to that of mammals and coincident with the two rounds of whole genome duplication that occurred in the gnathostome ancestor. Furthermore, novel gene members of the non-canonical NR0B receptors were found in the genomes of this lineage.

Here, we quantitatively analyze euselachian diversity during the last ca. 2 Ma of the Cretaceous using 1518 teeth from 40 vertebrate microfossil localities within the nonmarine facies of the Hell Creek Formation, northeastern Montana, USA. We identify 10 euselachians including one hybodont, five orectolobiforms, one lamniform, one sclerorhynchiform, and two rajiforms. Among these, two are novel and described herein. Diversity metrics reveal an increase in species richness and heterogeneity from the lower to middle portions of the Hell Creek Formation. Thereafter, diversity remained elevated and stable with no turnover until similar to 5 m below the K-Pg boundary. Above this horizon, including the last similar to 50 kyr of the Cretaceous, raw species richnesses dropped precipitously, and all euselachians (except possibly Myledaphus) went locally extinct across the boundary. Preceding this drop in richness, changes in euselachian community structure occurred, including steady declines in the relative abundances of M. pustulosus. These patterns do not support regression of the Western Interior Seaway as the single proximal cause of euselachian extinctions across the K-Pg boundary. Rather, euselachian local extinctions likely were the result of the multiple environmental perturbations occurring just before (volcanism, climate change) and at the K-Pg boundary (bolide impact). This high-resolution temporal pattern of euselachian diversity adds to those from other local taxa (e.g., mammals, lissamphibians) to present a more complex view of the K-Pg mass extinction of the continental biota.

Yet, human-wildlife interactions that result in threat to humans are rarely explicitly addressed in planning and almost not at all in MSP. Rare events of unprovoked shark bites can significantly impact local economies while leading to polarized social debates that often hinder the development of evidence-based shark risk public policy. Here, we suggest an approach for integrating shark risk and its management into MSP. The method addresses simultaneously the spatial, social, and ecological components of shark risk and its inherent uncertainties. The approach is applied on Reunion Island case study where shark risk management is implemented as a response to a rapid increase in the frequency of shark bite events over the past decade. Similar to other countries where shark risk management is implemented, sharks' removal is in the heart of social debate in Reunion Islands (3860 shark fishing operations in 5 years) and data gaps provide a fertile ground for alternative discourses and social conflicts about shark risk. Through a structured public consultation involving 200 stakeholders we demonstrate how MSP can be used to address shark risk while considering multiple sea-uses and conservation objectives. The results suggest that the approach is ideal, both for integrating shark risk as a driver to the MSP process, and for developing a transparent, sustainable and evidence-based shark risk public policy as it places shark risk management within a broader social-ecological spectrum of stakes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1462-9011,1873-6416,,,,SEP,2020,111,,,,,,18,26,,10.1016/j.envsci.2020.05.014,,,,,,,WOS:000540245400003,,,,,,

Just as in the past, present day industrial fishers search for the presence of whale shark as cue to locate tuna schools. These whale shark-tuna associations have been usually assumed to result from the same ecological drivers that govern the attraction of tunas and other fishes towards floating objects or Fish Aggregation Devices (FAD). Yet, this assumption has never been explicitly investigated. As a result, the ecological (evolutionary) significance of the whale shark-tuna associations and the potential impacts of fishing these associations remain unclear. Here, we set out to test a set of predictions expected under the framework of the 'indicator-log' and the 'meeting-point' hypotheses, originally proposed in the context of the tuna-FAD associative behaviour, by contrasting interannual fishing patterns, over 16-years, across highly variable whale shark abundance periods and comparing whale shark associated tuna schools and free swimming schools in the Azores. In addition we also analysed the tuna fishing fleet behaviour over periods of high and low whale shark abundance across the archipelago. We found an overall south and eastward migration of fishing effort towards lower latitudes, where most whale sharks were reported, compared to the low whale shark occurrence period. Overall we found that the whale shark associated school differed from free swimming schools and fishing yields were also influenced by the presence of the whale shark. Specifically, we found that skipjack, bigeye, albacore and yellowfin tuna are caught in higher quantities when associated with whale sharks. Whale shark associated schools were more diverse and yielded smaller fish on average than free-swimming schools, as predicted under the theoretical framework of tuna-FAD associations. Our results highlight the possibility that whale shark behaviour may play an active role in the association dynamics, and that these associations may be mutually beneficial. We argue that whale sharks may represent a meeting point for the aggregation of small tunas and that this behaviour is more likely to be size dependent than species oriented. Finally, we discuss the potential implications of our findings for the management and conservation of both tunas and whale sharks.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0165-7836,1872-6763,,,,SEP,2020,229,,,,,,,,105598,10.1016/j.fishres.2020.105598,,,,,,,WOS:000539099200012,,,,,,

Pelagic sharks are increasingly retained by mixed-species fisheries, or are discarded and not reported by selective fisheries for tunas (Thunnusspp.) or swordfish (Xiphias gladius). We estimated the fishing mortality of sharks (landings plus discard mortalities) in a South African-flagged pelagic longline fishery with diverse targeting and discard behaviour. A hierarchical cluster analysis was used to stratify the fleet according to the relative proportions of tunas, swordfish, blue sharks (Prionace glauca) and shortfin mako sharks (Isurus oxyrinchus) landed by individual vessels between 2013 and 2015. A spatial analysis of logbook data indicated that subfleets operated in distinct fishing areas, with overlap. Approximately 5% of all commercial longlines set during 2015 were sampled by a fisheries-independent observer, and the species, discard ratios and physical condition at discard of 6 019 captured sharks were recorded. Blue sharks and shortfin makos dominated observed shark catches, which were comprised of nine species and two species groups. Some 47% of observed sharks were retained and 20% were discarded in good physical condition. Only 4% of shortfin makos were discarded, compared to 68% of blue sharks. Blue shark discard mortality rates were twice as high as published at-vessel mortality rates, suggesting that onboard handling, among other factors, contributed to discard mortalities. Extrapolation to total fishing effort indicated a near 10-fold increase in blue shark and shortfin mako fishing mortality compared to an earlier study (1998-2005). Escalating shortfin mako fishing mortality was attributed to increased targeting to supply higher market demand. Discarding of blue sharks by selective fishing for tunas and swordfish had a greater impact on their fishing mortality than retention by shark-directed fleets. Higher levels of observer sampling are required to increase confidence in discard ratio estimates.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1932-6203,,,,,AUG 31,2020,15,8,,,,,,,e0238595,10.1371/journal.pone.0238595,,,,,,,WOS:000567946300017,32866206,,,,,

Because they occupy a high trophic level, assessing muscle tissue metal concentrations in sharks may reflect metal transfer in marine food webs. In this study, concentrations of cadmium, copper, lead, nickel, selenium, silver, and zinc were measured in the muscle ofRhizoprionodon terraenovae(Atlantic sharpnose shark) from 12 sites along the coast of the southeastern United States.

Here, we report a widespread change in the functional diversity of fisheries catches from the large marine ecosystems (LMEs) of the world over the past 65 years (1950 to 2014). The spatial and temporal trends of functional diversity exploited from the LMEs were calculated using global reconstructed marine fisheries catch data provided by the Sea Around Us initiative (including subsistence, artisanal, recreational, industrial fisheries, and discards) and functional trait data available in FishBase. Our analyses uncovered a substantial increase in the functional richness of both ray-finned fishes (80% of LMEs) and cartilaginous species (sharks and rays) (75% of LMESs), in line with an increase in the taxonomic richness, extracted from these ecosystems. The functional evenness and functional divergence of these catches have also altered substantially over the time span of this study, with considerable geographic variation in the patterns detected.

To characterize the relationship between genome features and biological traits, we sequenced and assembled the genome of the whale shark and compared its genomic and physiological features to those of 83 animals and yeast. We examined the scaling relationships between body size, temperature, metabolic rates, and genomic features and found both general correlations across the animal kingdom and features specific to the whale shark genome. Among animals, increased lifespan is positively correlated to body size and metabolic rate. Several genomic traits also significantly correlated with body size, including intron and gene length. Our large-scale comparative genomic analysis uncovered general features of metazoan genome architecture: Guanine and cytosine (GC) content and codon adaptation index are negatively correlated, and neural connectivity genes are longer than average genes in most genomes. Focusing on the whale shark genome, we identified multiple features that significantly correlate with life-span. Among these were very long gene length, due to introns being highly enriched in repetitive elements such as CR1-like long interspersed nuclear elements, and considerably longer neural genes of several types, including connectivity, activity, and neuro-degeneration genes. The whale shark genome also has the second slowest evolutionary rate observed in vertebrates to date. Our comparative genomics approach uncovered multiple genetic features associated with body size, metabolic rate, and lifespan and showed that the whale shark is a promising model for studies of neural architecture and lifespan.",,,,,"Bhak, Youngjune/0000-0002-9273-6984; Luria, Victor/0000-0003-0558-0983",,,,,,,,,,,,0027-8424,,,,,AUG 25,2020,117,34,,,,,20662,20671,,10.1073/pnas.1922576117,,,,,,,WOS:000572978200016,32753383,,,,,

Territories associated with a highly localized team typically exhibited higher interest toward their respective sport, with the inverse found in deterritorialized regions. Although most sport teams have a city based identity, consumer interest can vary widely within such cities.

Understanding the genetic population structure of sharks is key to effective management, maximizing their evolutionary potential in a rapidly changing environment and preventing population declines. Limited dispersal is an important factor promoting population divergence for several coastal shark species. The genetic variation in 14 microsatellite loci and 21,006 single nucleotide polymorphisms genotyped using restriction-site-associated DNA sequencing was analysed to assess the genetic structure of the bonnethead shark,Sphyrna tiburo, in the western North Atlantic. Genetic differences were identified among three well-defined regions: the western Florida coast, the south-eastern US Atlantic coast, and the southern Gulf of Mexico. Results support previous studies based on mitochondrial DNA sequences in defining differences among these regions and suggest limitations of bonnethead sharks in routinely performing long-distance migrations. The limited connectivity among regions explains the pattern of genetic divergence but also reported divergence at the species/subspecies level. These genetically discrete bonnethead populations have independent evolutionary histories that may include local adaptations to specific areas. Bonnethead sharks are currently managed as two stocks in the USA owing to recent genetic, tagging, and life history studies; however, no stock assessments or management plans exist for Mexico. These results not only serve to reinforce US management strategies and provide critical data about the extent of gene flow and sex dispersal among populations, but also begin the process of effective management in the waters of Mexico to ensure the long-term productivity and resilience of this species. With an absence of gene flow between populations from US waters and the southern Gulf of Mexico, there is a need for management plans based upon independent biological and population dynamics data since limited or no opportunities for populations to interchange individuals may occur to re-establish population viability.",,,,,"Adams, Douglas/0000-0002-3539-6629; Glenn, Travis/0000-0001-7725-3637",,,,,,,,,,,,1052-7613,1099-0755,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1002/aqc.3434,,AUG 2020,,,,,WOS:000562315900001,,,,,,

The bionic ribbed surface of drag reduction inspired from shark skin has been widely used in various parts and achieved good drag reduction effect. However, in the actual processing process, there are situations where the ribbed surface cannot be processed due to the large stepover, while the ribbed surface processed can be damaged due to the small stepover, which ultimately affects the surface quality and surface integrity. Combining the particularity of the structure of the aero-engine blade and the micro-characteristics of the bionic ribbed surface, the relationship between the stepover and the micro-characteristics of belt grinding is established. Experimental detection found that the optimization effectively avoids the situation where the ribbed surface is largely damaged and the ribbed surface will not be processed in some locations.

Public aquaria globally display numerous threatened fish species captured from wild populations. Potential impacts of harvests are rarely evaluated despite the need for improved management and conservation practices. 2. Sawfishes (Family Pristiidae) are one of the world's most at-risk fish families. Most commonly displayed (30+ wild caught individuals) is the Critically Endangered largetooth sawfish,Pristis pristis. 3. Two Australian aquaria release captiveP. prististo the wild as they outgrow displays, intending to offset impacts of the original harvests. The fate of released sawfish is unknown. 4. Using acoustic telemetry, the behaviour (rates of movement, patterns of habitat use) and survival of aquarium released sawfish (n= 5) were compared to a control group of wild sawfish (n= 5). 5. Aquarium sawfish had reduced rates of movement, were more sedentary, and occupied smaller activity spaces than wild sawfish; but diel activity and habitat use patterns were similar. 6. Collectively, mortality was high. Two aquarium sawfish survived to the end of the monitoring period (391 days and 117 days, respectively), and no wild sawfish survived. The mean duration of survival for aquarium and wild sawfish was 157 and 58 days, respectively. 7. Whilst captivity affected behaviours, the lower mortality rates of aquarium sawfish indicates that releases may partially offset the impact of the original harvest. Further data are required to investigate potential long-term ecological impacts. 8. If P. pristis are to be used for aquarium displays, the best conservation outcomes could be achieved by harvesting in the first year of life when natural mortality is highest, followed by release into the freshwater reaches of the natal river where predation risk may be minimized. Size on release should be less than similar to 2,800 mm total length to allow for migration from the river system as part of their natural life cycle.",,,,,"Kyne, Peter/0000-0003-4494-2625",,,,,,,,,,,,1052-7613,1099-0755,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1002/aqc.3400,,AUG 2020,,,,,WOS:000561712300001,,,,,,

Shark Bay, Australia has some of the best examples of modern microbial mats thriving under harsh conditions of high temperatures, salinity, desiccation, and ultraviolet (UV) radiation. Microorganisms living in extreme ecosystems are thought to potentially encode for secondary metabolites as a survival strategy. Many secondary metabolites are natural products encoded by a grouping of genes known as biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs). Natural products have diverse chemical structures and functions which provide competitive advantages for microorganisms and can also have biotechnology applications. In the present study, the diversity of BGC were described in detail for the first time from Shark Bay microbial mats. A total of 1477 BGCs were detected in metagenomic data over a 20 mm mat depth horizon, with the surface layer possessing over 200 BGCs and containing the highest relative abundance of BGCs of all mat layers. Terpene and bacteriocin BGCs were highly represented and their natural products are proposed to have important roles in ecosystem function in these mat systems. Interestingly, potentially novel BGCs were detected from Heimdallarchaeota and Lokiarchaeota, two evolutionarily significant archaeal phyla not previously known to possess BGCs.

These deposits are considered part of the Middle Eastern to North African phosphogenic province of the Late Cretaceous-Paleogene age. Petrographic, X-ray diffraction, and scanning electron microscopy with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy analyses were conducted to examine phosphorite samples from Hazm Al-Jalamid. Phosphatic grains were primarily present in the forms of pellets and/or peloids, ooids, coprolites, fish bone fragments (BFs), and shark teeth. Phosphatic minerals were collophane, carbonate fluorapatite, and hydroxylapatite accompanied by non-phosphatic particles of quartz, shell fragments, and clay materials. Phosphatic and non-phosphatic particles were bound together by calcite cement. A systematic microscopic study on phosphorite sediments revealed that the pelletal grains were formed via several diagenetic processes. Most grains were formed through growth around a foreign particle (e.g., fish BFs), phosphomicritization of BFs, fragmentation and abrasion of bone and intraclasts, pelletization of aggregates, and phosphatization and fragmentation of fecal pellets. The depositional environment of Hazm Al-Jalamid phosphorite is characterized by paleo-highs and restricted areas created by local tectonics and low topographic swells and basins within the huge syncline of the Sirhan-Turayf sub-basin.

To investigate the extent to which oscillatory diving by tiger sharks conform to these patterns, we used a biologging approach to model their cost of transport. High-resolution biologging tags with tri-axial sensors were deployed on 21 tiger sharks at Ningaloo Reef for durations of 5-48 h. Using overall dynamic body acceleration as a proxy for energy expenditure, we modelled the cost of transport of oscillatory movements of varying geometries in both horizontal and vertical planes for tiger sharks. The cost of horizontal transport was minimized by descending at the smallest possible angle and ascending at an angle of 5-14 degrees, meaning that vertical oscillations conserved energy compared to swimming at a level depth. The reduction of vertical travel costs occurred at steeper angles. The absolute dive angles of tiger sharks increased between inshore and offshore zones, presumably to reduce the cost of transport while continuously hunting for prey in both benthic and surface habitats. Oscillatory movements of tiger sharks conform to strategies of cost-efficient foraging, and shallow inshore habitats appear to be an important habitat for both hunting prey and conserving energy while travelling.",,,,,"Meekan, Mark/0000-0002-3067-9427",,,,,,,,,,,,2054-5703,,,,,AUG 19,2020,7,8,,,,,,,200789,10.1098/rsos.200789,,,,,,,WOS:000565603500001,32968529,,,,,

Understanding the proportion of time that silky sharks spend associated with floating objects is essential for assessing the impacts of the extensive use of fish aggregating devices (FADs) in the tropical tuna purse-seine fisheries, including increased probability of incidental capture and the potential of an ecological trap. Previous studies provided insight into the amount of time that silky sharks spent at an individual FAD but were unable to assess neither the time spent between two associations nor the proportion of time spent associated/unassociated. The percentage of time that juvenile silky sharks spend unassociated with floating objects was estimated through the analysis of horizontal movements of 26 silky sharks monitored with pop-up archival tags. Under the assumption that a high association rate with drifting FADs would align the trajectories of tracked sharks with ocean surface currents, a novel methodology is proposed, based on the comparison of shark trajectories with simulated trajectories of passively drifting particles derived using a Lagrangian model. Results revealed that silky shark trajectories were divergent from surface currents, and thus unassociated with FADs, for at least 30% of their time.

However, little is known on the integrated nature of movement behaviours and their relationship to healthy development in this age range. Thus, the objective of this study was to examine the relationships between accelerometer-derived movement behaviours and indicators of physical, cognitive, and social-emotional development using compositional analyses in a sample of preschool-aged children. Methods Children (n = 95) were recruited in Edmonton, Canada. Movement behaviours were measured with ActiGraph wGT3X-BT accelerometers worn 24 hours/day. Physical (i.e., body mass index [BMI] z-scores, percent of adult height, and motor skills), cognitive (i.e., working memory, response inhibition, and vocabulary), and social-emotional (i.e., sociability, externalizing, internalizing, prosocial behaviour, and cognitive, emotional, and behavioural self-regulation) development were assessed. Objective height and weight were measured for BMI z-scores and percent of adult height, while the Test of Gross Motor Development-2 was used to assess motor skills. The Early Years Toolbox was used to assess all cognitive and social-emotional development indicators. Compositional linear regression models and compositional substitution models were conducted in R. Results Children accumulated 11.1 hours of sleep, 6.1 hours of stationary time, 5.1 hours of light-intensity physical activity (LPA), and 1.8 hours of moderate- to vigorous-intensity physical activity (MVPA) per day. Movement behaviour compositions were significantly associated with physical (i.e., locomotor skills, object motor skills, and total motor skills) and cognitive (i.e., working memory and vocabulary) development (R(2)range: 0.11-0.18). In relation to other movement behaviours in the composition, MVPA was positively associated with most physical development outcomes; while stationary time had mixed findings for cognitive development outcomes (i.e., mainly positive associations in linear regressions but non-significant in substitution models). Most associations for LPA and sleep were non-significant. Conclusions The overall composition of movement behaviors appeared important for development. Findings confirmed the importance of MVPA for physical development. Mixed findings between stationary time and cognitive development could indicate this sample engaged in both beneficial (e.g., reading) and detrimental (e.g., screen time) stationary time.

Using dynamic social networks generated from acoustic tracking data, we document spatially structured sociality in CPF grey reef sharks at a Pacific Ocean atoll. We show that sharks form stable social groups over multiyear periods, with some dyadic associations consistent for up to 4 years. Groups primarily formed during the day, increasing in size throughout the morning before sharks dispersed from the reef at night. Our simulations suggest that multiple individuals sharing a central place and using social information while foraging (i.e. local enhancement) will outperform non-CPF social foragers.

As the new species closely resembles a taxon established in the 19th century (i.e., Burtinopsis), a detailed analysis of this taxon was necessary to support the new taxonomic statements of this article. Methods: A new partial skeleton including skull and earbones is described and compared to an extended sample of living and fossil mysticete species. A phylogenetic analysis including 355 character states scored in 88 taxa was performed to understand its relationships within the genus Protororqualus, to allow paleobiogeographic inferences and to better understand the relationships of Protororqualus within Balaenopteridae. Maximum parsimony analyses of character evolution were performed to understand morphological transformations within Balaenopteridae. The revision of Burtinopsis was carried out based on detailed descriptions and comparisons of the type materials that were figured and measured. Results: Protororqualus wilfriedneesi sp. nov. was established based on a comparative analysis of the skull and earbone morphology. The specimen is dated back to the Zanclean (Lower Pliocene, between c. 5.3 and 3.6 Ma). A taphonomical study of the holotype skeleton revealed evidence of interactions with sharks and fishes before the definitive burial of the carcass. Based on the phylogenetic analysis, the monophyly of the genus Protororqualus was confirmed. Protororqualus wilfriedneesi sp. nov. was more derived than Protororqualus cuvieri suggesting that it resulted from an invasion of the North Sea Basin (and the North Atlantic ocean) from the Mediterranean basin. Several specimens from western and eastern sides of the Atlantic Ocean are described that suggest that Protororqualus wilfriedneesi had a trans-Atlantic distribution in the Pliocene.",,,,,"Bisconti, Michelangelo/0000-0002-0281-4863",,,,,,,,,,,,2167-8359,,,,,AUG 12,2020,8,,,,,,,,e9570,10.7717/peerj.9570,,,,,,,WOS:000558591500004,,,,,,

There is increasing evidence to show that micro-variations in habitat use may promote coexistence through minimizing direct competition for space and resources. We used two sympatric marine predators that show high fidelity to a small, remote coral atoll as a model to investigate how temporally dynamic partitioning of space use may promote coexistence. Using novel methods (difference network analysis and dynamic space occupancy analysis), we revealed that even though blacktip reef sharks Carcharhinus melanopterus and sicklefin lemon sharks Negaprion acutidens both show focused use of the same atoll habitats, the spatio-temporal dynamics of their use was partitioned such that they only shared the same microhabitats 26% of the time. Moreover, the degree of overlap was strongly influenced by the tidal cycle, peaking at similar to 35% at higher tides as both species appear to target similar intertidal micro-habitats despite the increase in available space. Our work provides a rare example of how two marine predators with similar ecological roles and habitat preferences may coexist in the same place through dynamic segregation of habitat use in space and time, potentially reflecting adaptive behavioral traits for minimizing interactions. The strong influence of small tidal variation on species habitat use and partitioning also raises concerns over how atoll ecosystem dynamics may be influenced by sea level rises that could alter tidal dynamics.",,,,,"Bortoluzzi, Jenny/0000-0002-0496-5358",,,,,,,,,,,,,2296-7745,,,,AUG 7,2020,7,,,,,,,,624,10.3389/fmars.2020.00624,,,,,,,WOS:000558707000001,,,,,,

Measures of reproductive effort (flowering and fruit production and seed to ovule ratios) and estimates of genetic diversity and mating patterns (nuclear microsatellite DNA loci) were used to assess sexual reproduction in northern range edge (low latitude, elevated salinities, Shark Bay World Heritage Site) and centre of range (mid-latitude, oceanic salinity, Perth metropolitan waters) meadows in Western Australia. Flower and fruit production were highly variable among meadows and there was no significant relationship between seed to ovule ratio and clonal diversity. However, Shark Bay meadows were two orders of magnitude less fecund than those in Perth metropolitan waters. Shark Bay meadows were characterized by significantly lower levels of genetic diversity and a mixed mating system relative to meadows in Perth metropolitan waters, which had high genetic diversity and a completely outcrossed mating system. The combination of reproductive and genetic data showed overall lower sexual productivity in Shark Bay meadows relative to Perth metropolitan waters. The mixed mating system is likely driven by a combination of local environmental conditions and pollen limitation.

For this reason, a demographic analysis is necessary to determine the extent of this decline and the fishing effect on the BNC's population. Therefore, we performed a stochastic demographic analysis of the population in the BNC, and considered its global center of abundance. Smalltail shark specimens (n= 937) were collected with gillnets in Maranhao state, eastern BNC, in the 1980s with sizes ranging between 29.6 and 120.0 cm total length. Most of the individuals (90.6%) caught were juveniles (< 6 years-old), and the mortality and exploitation rates showed that the species was overexploited (92.3% above the fishing mortality corresponding to the population equilibrium threshold). The smalltail shark's biological characteristics, such as slow growth and low fecundity, demonstrate that it is one of the least resilient species among similar sized coastal sharks in the region. All these factors yielded an annual decrease of 28% in the intrinsic population growth rate, resulting in a population decline of more than 90% in only 10 years, and much higher for the current period. This set of features comprising fishing recruitment occurring upon juveniles, overfishing, and intrinsically low resilience make the population unable to sustain fishing pressure and severely hamper biological recruitment, thus causing this drastic population decline.

This study examined the effect of several demographic, economic and socioenvironmental factors on the quality of knowledge about and perceptions toward sharks in two contrasting scenarios from northeastern Brazil: a shark hazardous coastal region and a marine protected insular area. Ordered logistic regression models were built using Ukert data collected with a self-administered questionnaire survey (N = 1094). A clear relationship between education, knowledge and perceptions was found, with low education level and knowledge of sharks resulting in more negative perceptions toward these species. Prejudice toward sharks stemmed as a potentially limiting factor because the positive effects of other variables such as affinity for nature and specific knowledge about sharks were superseded by the effects of negative prejudice. Other practical factors such as age, economic level, and gender, also influenced respondent's knowledge and perceptions and could provide a guidance for optimizing socioenvironmental gains relative to public engagement efforts. Results also suggested that populations inhabiting regions with high shark bite incidence likely require distinct outreach methods because some factors underlying knowledge and perception dynamics exhibited structural differences in their effects when compared to the trends observed in a marine protected area. Altogether, public perceptions and attitudes toward sharks could be feasibly enhanced with educational development and nature experiencing strategies. Moreover, disseminating shark-specific knowledge across the society might catalyze support for the conservation of these species in a cost-effective way.

Tropical rivers and estuaries are highly dynamic environments, where environmental conditions change dramatically over spatial and temporal scales. This creates both physiological and ecological challenges for euryhaline elasmobranchs, where fluctuations in salinity can impact not only osmoregulatory function but also the ability to find and acquire prey. 2. We investigated how spatial and temporal variation in environmental salinity influences physiological homoeostasis, habitat utilization and migration timing in two euryhaline carcharhinid sharks within a tropical river in northern Australia. Neonate and juvenile bull sharks Carcharhinus leucas and speartooth sharks Glyphis glyphis were tracked over a 4-year period using implanted acoustic tags and an array of hydrophone receivers. Tissue samples were also collected from captured sharks and analysed for interspecific differences in plasma osmolarity, urea and electrolyte (Na+ and K+) concentrations and the stable isotopes delta C-13 and delta N-15. 3. We discovered that immature C. leucas and G. glyphissegregate spatially along a salinity gradient between September and December, where the mean volume of intersection between species dropped as low as 0.01. While G. glyphis used higher salinity environments (mean salinity = 19.22) located between 30 and 70 km from the mouth of the estuary, C. leucas occupied freshwater reaches (mean salinity = 1.98) between 60 and 110 km upstream. Plasma osmolarities of both species were always hyperosmotic to the environment, with electrolyte concentrations maintained within a narrow range independent of environmental osmolarities. At the onset of the wet season, both C. leucas and G. glyphis undertook a coordinated downstream migration towards the lower estuary before returning upstream. 4. Carcharhinus leucas blood tissues were more enriched in d(15)N and delta C-13 than samples collected from similar sizeG. glyphis, suggesting that these species not only spatially segregate within low salinity habitats but also prey on different dietary resources. Furthermore, a loss of enriched isotopic values in fin tissue with increasing body length provides further support for marine use by adult sharks in conjunction with dependence on rivers as important nursery habitat.

Vertical social transmission from parent to offspring [7] is thought to be adaptive because of the parental generation being more skilled than maturing individuals. It is found throughout the animal kingdom, particularly in species with prolonged parental care, e.g., [8, 9]. Social learning can also occur among members of the same generation [4, 10, 11] or between older, non-parental individuals and younger generations [7] via horizontal or oblique transmission, respectively. Extensive work on primate culture has shown that horizontal transmission of foraging behavior is biased toward species with broad cultural repertoires [12] and those with increased levels of social tolerance [13, 14], such as great apes. Vertical social transmission has been established as the primary transmission mechanism of foraging behaviors in the Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops aduncus) population of Shark Bay, Western Australia [6, 9, 15, 16]. Here, we investigated the spread of another foraging strategy, shelling'' [17], whereby some dolphins in this population feed on prey trapped inside large marine gastropod shells. Using a multi-network version of network-based diffusion analysis (NBDA), we show that shelling behavior spreads primarily through non-vertical social transmission. By statistically accounting for both environmental and genetic influences, our findings thus represent the first evidence of non-vertical transmission of a foraging tactic in toothed whales.

Managing bait type offers one tool to control species selectivity. Different species and sizes of marine predators have different prey, and hence bait, preferences. This preference is a function of a bait's chemical, visual, acoustic and textural characteristics and size, and for seabirds the effect on hook sink rate is also important. We conducted a global meta-analysis of existing estimates of the relative risk of capture on different pelagic longline baits. We applied a Bayesian random effects meta-analytic regression modelling approach to estimate overall expected bait-specific catch rates. For blue shark and marine turtles, there were 34% (95% HDI: 4-59%) and 60% (95% HDI: 44-76%) significantly lower relative risks of capture on forage fish bait than squid bait, respectively. Overall estimates of bait-specific relative risk were not significantly different for seven other assessed taxa. The lack of a significant overall estimate of relative capture risk for pelagic shark species combined but significant effect for blue sharks suggests there is species-specific variability in bait-specific catch risk within this group. A qualitative literature review suggests that tunas and istiophorid billfishes may have higher catch rates on squid than fish bait, which conflicts with reducing marine turtle and blue shark catch rates. The findings from this synthesis of quantitative and qualitative evidence support identifying economically viable bycatch management measures with acceptable tradeoffs when multispecies conflicts are unavoidable, and highlight research priorities for global pelagic longline fisheries.",,,,,"CHALOUPKA, Milani/0000-0001-8109-005X",,,,,,,,,,,,0960-3166,1573-5184,,,,SEP,2020,30,3,,,,,535,551,,10.1007/s11160-020-09612-0,,AUG 2020,,,,,WOS:000555361400001,,,,,,

In this study we address field sampling protocols and estimation methods for robust estimation of mark rate and its uncertainty in cetacean populations. We present two alternatives for estimating the variance of mark rate: (1) a variance estimator for clusters of unequal sizes (SRCS) and (2) a hierarchical Bayesian model (SRCS-Bayes), and compare them to the simple random sampling (SRS) variance estimator. We tested these variance estimators using a simulation to see how they perform at varying mark rates, number of groups sampled, photos per group, and mean group sizes. The hierarchical Bayesian model outperformed the frequentist variance estimators, with the true mark rate of the population held in its 95% HDI 91.9% of the time (compared with coverage of 79% for the SRS method and 76.3% for the SRCS-Cochran method). The simulation results suggest that, ideally, mark rate and its precision should be quantified using hierarchical Bayesian modeling, and researchers should attempt to sample as many unique groups as possible to improve accuracy and precision.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0824-0469,1748-7692,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1111/mms.12723,,AUG 2020,,,,,WOS:000554862200001,,,,,,

To develop, implement, and evaluate a co-curricular activity in which second-year Doctor of Pharmacy (PharmD) students developed an idea for a new clinical pharmacy service. Methods. A brief co-curricular activity based on the television series SharkTank was developed to encourage innovation and entrepreneurship. Second-year pharmacy students worked in assigned teams and were allowed one hour to develop an innovative clinical service to solve a pharmacy-related problem. Students then pitched their idea to a panel of four faculty members who served as the sharks and graded the teams using a rubric. The rubric which was employed was mapped to the Center for the Advancement of Pharmacy Education (CAPE) Educational Outcomes. A pre- and post-activity survey was administered to students to gather information about changes in their perceptions of innovation and entrepreneurship in pharmacy. Results. Student groups received higher scores on their ability to present background information and the need for their clinical service and lower scores in areas such as tracking outcomes and predicting challenges. On the post-activity survey, 96.7% of students agreed that the activity gave them a better understanding of pharmacists' roles in establishing new clinical services, and 86.7% stated they intend to actively seek out new clinical pharmacy service opportunities in their future career. Conclusion. Results of the survey demonstrate that students understand the importance of innovation and entrepreneurship in pharmacy practice, and almost all students felt that the activity gave them an even better understanding of the pharmacist's role in clinical service development. This activity can serve as a blueprint for schools of pharmacy looking to incorporate creative and fun methods of exposing PharmD students to innovation and entrepreneurship activities.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0002-9459,1553-6467,,,,AUG 1,2020,84,8,,,,,1077,1084,7805,10.5688/ajpe7805,,,,,,,WOS:000569131900010,32934385,,,,,

The moth flam optimization, cat swarm optimization (CSO), particle swarm optimization (PSO), shark algorithm (SA), grey wolf optimization (GWO), and gravitational search algorithm (GSA) were used to train the ANFIS, SVM, and ANN models. The data were collected from Yazd plain (Iran) to predict the Total Dissolved Solids (TDS). The principal component analysis was used to determine the most appropriate inputs for predicting TDS. The hybrid ANFIS-MFO improved the accuracy of RMSE (roo mean square error) over the ANN-MFO and SVM-MFO models by 1.4% and 3.8%, respectively. It was also observed that the SVM model had the least NSE (Nash Sutcliffe efficiency) value among all the models. Unlike the standalone ANFIS, the multilayer perceptron (MLP), and SVMs models, the hybrid ANFIS, ANN, and SVM demonstrated high accuracy in the training and testing phase, so that in the optimal hybrid model, ANFIS-MFO, values of mean absolute error (MAE), Nash Sutcliff efficiency (NSE), and percent bias (PBIAS) were 2.21 (mg/lit), 0.94, 0.15, 2.981 (mg/lit), 0.93, and 0.18, respectively. The ANFIS-MFO was also seen to further enhance the RMSE by approximately 3% and 7%, as compared to the ANN-MFO and SVM-MFO. This study also aims to investigate the temporal variability TDS using innovative trend analysis (ITA). The TDS value of < 1800 (mg/lit) indicates a decreasing trend, while a medium TDS value (2000 mg/lit < TDS < 2800 mg/lit) does not have a significant trend. The high TDS values (TDS > 3000 mg/lit) indicate an increasing trend.

Computational models are powerful tools that has been used for predicting influent time series. But, one of the major drawbacks of developed models is uncertainty analysis in instantaneous and multi-time step prediction of influent time series. For this purpose, a Multi-objective Shark Smell Optimization (MOSSO) algorithm is hybridized with multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural network, radial basis function (RBF) neural networks, and support vector machine (SVM) to optimize the models. These hybrid models of MLP-MOSSO, RBF-MOSSO, and SVM-MOSSO are used for predicting different prediction horizons of immediate, short-term, and long-term of influent time series. Accordingly, there are three objectives in MOSSO: (1) minimize mean absolute error (MAE) in different input vectors for best selection lag time influent time series, (2) achieve the optimal architecture of forecasting models by minimization root mean square error (RMSE) for model parameters, and (3) select accurate activate functions or kernel function of models for finding high accuracy of estimating models. The studied hybrid multi-objective models are modified using Taguchi method for determination of Pareto optimal solution sets. The proposed hybrid models and standalone models of MLP, RBF, and SVM are evaluated using Monte-Carlo uncertainty analysis, common evaluation criteria, and Taylor diagram in evaluation and reliability assessments. The results demonstrated that MLP-MOSSO model produce better results than RBF-MOSSO, SVM-MOSSO, and standalone models in all prediction horizons (S1I4: immediate-Q((t-5min)), Q((t-10min)); S2I16: short term Q((t-12hr)), Q((t-24hr)); S3I15: long term-Q((t-2day)), Q((t-4day))).

As the structure of collagen determines its function, the final objective of this study was to investigate biochemical differences between both collagens to identify future potential applications. Chromatographic behavior revealed differences in collagen from both species. Increases of temperature and stirring time produced no effect on European hake collagen solubility in the mobile phase, resulting in the same chromatographic profiles. Conversely, the application of temperature and stirring-time increments showed a positive effect on Blue shark collagen solubility, resulting in different chromatographic profiles and observing higher molecular weight components when sample is incubated at 50 degrees C (15 min) after 48 h stirring. To test if the different chromatographic behavior exhibited by both collagens could be influenced by differences in subunit composition (alpha-chains), cation exchange chromatography was employed to separate collagen subunits. The electrophoretic patterns and gel permeation chromatography with light-scattering detection (GPC-LS) results of the obtained cation exchange peak fractions revealed differences regarding subunit composition between both species, influencing the crosslinking pattern.

The gestation period is unknown, but embryos reach a length of around 40 cm at birth. Nutrition is derived from the yolk sac with minimal histotrophy. The surface area of the uterus is increased by villi that presumably increase in length with advancing gestation.

New products were sought after for export by Danish merchants and the peasant farming community responded by increasing the production of the relevant products. The whole period from 1800 to 1850 saw a continuing increase in the exports of sheep products and shark liver oil, which had a common origin in peasant farming production. This period contrasts with the eighteenth century when there was no corresponding growth in exports. The level of exports in the eighteenth century remained overall much the same except during periods of dearth, when it fell. Traditionally the beginning of the modernisation of Icelandic society is dated to around 1880-1910. However, it could be argued that increasing exports of sheep products and shark liver oil after 1800 saw a clear break with the eighteenth-century pattern and that the period should be taken into consideration as being the origin period of economic modernisation in Iceland. This article discusses questions the exclusion not only of the role of peasant farming in the modernisation narrative of Iceland, but also of the Copenhagen merchant houses that organised the goods export from Iceland after 1800.",,,,,"Juliusson, Arni Daniel/0000-0003-4518-7801",,,,,,,,,,,,0358-5522,1750-2837,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1080/03585522.2020.1788985,,AUG 2020,,,,,WOS:000558353100001,,,,,,

Direct burial in the beach is often used as a cost effective method of disposal. However, whale burial management plans are often met with public resistance owing to the perceived risk of shark attraction to burial leachate that may discharge from the seabed. A reactive transport model was combined with a numerical variable-density groundwater flow model to assess buried whale leachate plume formation, transport, influence on beach aquifer reactivity, and discharge to coastal surface water for a range of burial setback distances, depths, and whale sizes. A second set of simulations was performed to evaluate aquifer nitrate removal efficiencies for a range of buried wrack scenarios and to evaluate the role of organic carbon source on beach reactivity. A sensitivity analysis was performed for both sets of models across ten physical and reaction parameters. Simulations using the best estimate parameter set showed that whale burials can produce DOC and ammonium leachate plumes in the beach aquifer that are transported to and discharge near the low tide line in water depths of 0.4-2.4 m. DOC and ammonium concentrations in discharging whale leachate werel.6 and 26 times higher than typical surf zone concentrations, respectively. Of the factors tested, the burial distance inland from the high tide line was the most important factor affecting leachate fluxes to surface water. Burials placed farther inland led to smaller DOC fluxes to surface water, but increased ammonium fluxes. Burial depth also affected whale leachate to the subtidal zone, with deeper burials resulting in smaller fluxes of DOC. Leached DOC from whale decomposition and from buried wrack can fuel denitrification hotspots within beach sediments. The sensitivity analysis showed that nitrate removal supported by buried wrack and whale leachate fluxes are highly dependent on beach properties, hydrologic forcing, and reaction parameters. The wrack model results have implications for beach scraping and the whale burial models show that whale leachate can be delivered to the shallow subtidal zone via groundwater discharge pathways, with potential implications for shark attraction and whale burial management practices.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0169-7722,1873-6009,,,,AUG,2020,233,,,,,,,,103656,10.1016/j.jconhyd.2020.103656,,,,,,,WOS:000557880300003,32554099,,,,,

The size of the OB relative to the size of the brain has been positively correlated to a good olfactory capability but, recently, this correlation was questioned after new investigation techniques were developed. Among them, the isotropic fractionator allows to estimate the number of neurons and non-neurons in a given portion of nervous tissue. To date, this technique has been applied in a number of species; in particular the OB was separately analyzed in numerous mammals and in a single crocodile species. Thus, a quantitative description of the OB's cells is available for a small portion of vertebrates. Main aim of this work was to apply isotropic fractionator to investigate the olfactory capability of elasmobranch fishes, whose traditional concept of outstanding olfaction has recently been scaled down by anatomical and physiological studies. For this purpose, the OB of two elasmobranch species, Galeus melastomus and Scyliorhinus canicula, was studied leading to the determination of the number of neurons vs non-neurons in the OB of the specimens. In addition, the obtained cell quantification was related to the olfactory epithelium surface area to obtain a new parameter that encapsulates both information on the peripheral olfactory organ and the OB. The analyzed species resulted in an overall similar quantitative organization of the peripheral olfactory system; slight differences were detected possibly reflecting different environment preference and feeding strategy. Moreover, the non-neurons/neurons ratio of these species, compared to those available in the literature, seems to place elasmobranch fishes among the vertebrate species in which olfaction plays an important role.",,,,,"Amaroli, Andrea/0000-0002-0494-7942",,,,,,,,,,,,0944-2006,,,,,AUG,2020,141,,,,,,,,125796,10.1016/j.zool.2020.125796,,,,,,,WOS:000557218500005,32464514,,,,,

A significant increase in abundance was observed in both IUCN red list species during the ban. Surface seawater temperature had a marginal effect on the abundance of both species. The prohibition was in place for an insufficient length of time for long lasting effects to be detected on skate length. The population dynamic model indicated that the increase in abundance was only possible when combining the fisheries ban with increased juvenile discard survival. Our results indicate that species conservation measures may not only have positive effects on the species in question, but also on species with a niche overlap. Nonetheless, due to ongoing fishing for other species, the full potential of fisheries prohibitions may not be realised.

Here, we assessed the effects of sediment deposition during Hurricanes Wilma (2005) and Irma (2017) on soil elevation change at two mangrove forests located along the Shark and Lostmans Rivers in Everglades National Park. We used surface elevation change data from a 16-year period (2002-2018), measured with the surface elevation table-marker horizon (SET-MH) approach. At the Shark River mangrove forest, we used marker horizons and a combination of deep, shallow, and original SETs to quantify the contributions of four soil zones to net soil elevation change. Rates of elevation change were greatly influenced by storm sediments. Abrupt increases in elevation due to sediment inputs and subsurface expansion during Hurricane Wilma were followed by: (1) an initial post-hurricane period of elevation loss due to erosion of hurricane sediments and subsurface contraction; (2) a secondary period of elevation gain due primarily to accretion; and (3) an abrupt elevation gain due to new sediment inputs during Hurricane Irma.

However, the process underlying this exchange and leading to the evolution of these atypical TCR receptor genes remains elusive.

A pool of 32 VH delta genes divided into 18 subfamilies was found to be scattered over the two loci. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that these VH delta genes could be related to bird VH delta genes, VH delta/V mu genes in platypus or opossum, or alligator VH genes.

We analysed mercury concentration (organic and inorganic forms - T-Hg) in the muscle of Antarctic toothfish, Dissostichus mawsoni, a long-lived top predator which supports a highly profitable fishery. Our samples were collected in three fishing areas (one seamount and two on the continental slope) in the Southwest Pacific Sector of the Southern Ocean during the 2016/2017 fishing season. Mercury levels and the size range of fish varied between fishing areas, with the highest levels (0.68 +/- 0.45 mg kg(-1) wwt) occurring on the Amundsen Sea seamount where catches were dominated by larger, older fish. The most parsimonious model of mercury concentration included both age and habitat (seamount vs continental slope) as explanatory variables. Mean mercury levels for each fishing area were higher than those in all previous studies of D. mawsoni, with mean values for the Amundsen Sea seamount exceeding the 0.5 mg kg(-1) food safety threshold for the first time. It might therefore be appropriate to add D. mawsoni to the list of taxa, such as swordfish and sharks, which are known to exceed this threshold.

While this industry can provide community and conservation benefits, it presents risks to target species, environments and humans when inappropriately managed. To ensure appropriate management is implemented, there is a need to identify the prevalence of elasmobranch tourism globally, the types of operations occurring and the controls used to mitigate risk. This study undertook a global literature review to develop an industry activity typology and establish the types of management controls present across elasmobranch tourism operations. In total, 151 unique species-activity-location conditions were identified, with four broad activity types categorised: diving, snorkelling, provisioning and cage diving. Spanning 42 countries and 49 different species, 32% of conditions identified lacked evidence of management. Further to this, many of the prevailing management controls in place (e.g. MPAs, shark sanctuaries, protected species status), were secondary in nature, having not been designed or implemented to manage elasmobranch tourism explicitly. Therefore, avoidable risks are likely widespread throughout the industry. Encouragingly, the application of activity specific management controls is likely to be effective at reducing risks across activity types. The theoretical case studies and management tools investigated herein provide operators and industry managers with guidance on how to reduce risk and safeguard industry benefits.

However, constructive debate around shark issues has been stymied by the many stakeholders with conflicting or unclear objectives: Government Agencies with multiple objectives (sustainable management, conservation, public safety); fishers (commercial and recreational) that target certain species of sharks, or try to avoid interactions; tourism operators; indigenous peoples with cultural links; conservation groups; other ocean-users and members of the general public who may be shark-conservationists or shark-cull advocates. The confusion appears partly due to various stakeholder groups using the collective noun 'sharks' when discussing issues. The use of 'sharks' confuses debates in a way similar to other totemic taxa (e.g. whales) where unique attributes of multiple species have been combined. In the case of 'sharks' the situation is exacerbated by the large number of species (globally >500), the diversity of values attributed to species and the ability of stakeholders to have multiple values (e.g. fishers who regard sharks as desirable target species and as depredators of target species). We argue that 'sharks' extend the super-species concept, reducing clarity and hindering the development of more broadly acceptable policies. To improve this discourse we suggest that stakeholders define 'sharks' in discussions and reports with species-by-area descriptors (e.g. white-sharks in Western Australia); or as a minimum, on a defined group-by-area basis (e.g. sharks that support eco-tourism in South Africa; commercially important species of sharks in southern Australia), so the species in focus is (are) clearly defined, allowing future debates to be more constructive and support the development of more widely-acceptable policies.",,,,,"Molony, Brett/0000-0002-6143-3462; Thomson, Damian/0000-0001-5485-1562",,,,,,,,,,,,0308-597X,1872-9460,,,,AUG,2020,118,,,,,,,,103983,10.1016/j.marpol.2020.103983,,,,,,,WOS:000541263600034,,,,,,

Although there is significant variability in modern elasmobranch tooth enamel associated with physiology and diet, our record suggests a first-order increase in the average calcium isotopic composition of seawater by 0.5 parts per thousand and a decline in Sr/Ca ratios of similar to 40% over the last 100 million years.

Marine protected areas (MPAs) have thus become an indispensable tool for the protection of these marine predators. Two recently-created MPAs in the Northeast Pacific Ocean, the Revillagigedo National Park and Clipperton Atoll, are characterized by different trophic structures potentially influencing the trophic niche and contaminant exposure of resident sharks in these two sites. In this context, we used carbon (delta C-13) and nitrogen (delta N-15) stable isotope analyzes as well as total mercury concentrations ([THg]) to assess the effect of foraging site on the trophic niche and Hg levels of juvenile silvertip (ST) sharks Carcharhinus albimarginatus. Analyzing fin clip samples from Revillagigedo and Clipperton, we found that shark delta N-15 varied spatially in relation to delta N-15 baselines, suggesting similar trophic position in both MPAs. Moreover, delta C-13 values indicated that ST sharks from Revillagigedo would feed on different food webs (i.e. both benthic and pelagic) while individuals from Clipperton would only rely on benthic food webs. These differences between MPAs led to a weak overlap of isotopic niches between the two populations, highlighting the site residency of juvenile ST sharks. Within each population, [THg] was not correlated with trophic tracers (delta N-15 and delta C-13) and was also similar between populations. This study revealed no influence of site or food web in [THg] and raises the question of the origin of Hg exposure for reef shark populations in the Northeast Pacific Ocean. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

In Europe, Rajidae are commercially fished species that are vulnerable to overfishing, have historically been grouped in landings data and declines have been reported to the point of local extinction in some species. Management of these species is therefore important, however an understanding of species ecology and the way they interact with the fishery is lacking. Here we investigate how the differing ecology of four species affects interactions with the fishery by considering gear types, Marine Protected Areas, location of capture and geographic displacements. Our results demonstrate that the four species interacted differently with the fishery, for example Raja clavata were more commonly captured by static nets (69 % of recaptures) and Raja brachyura more commonly by trawlers (77 %). There were clear differences in the location of capture, depths and displacements of the four species resulting in differing interactions with existing management in the form of Marine Protected Areas. For example 53 % of R. clavata recaptures were within the boundaries of an MPA compared to 18 % for R. brachyura.

Whilst melanoma most commonly affects the skin, it can also arise in mucosal surfaces, the eye, and the brain. For new therapies to be developed, a better understanding of the genetic landscape, signalling pathways, and tumour-microenvironmental interactions is needed. This is where animal models are of critical importance. The mouse is the foremost used model of human melanoma. Arguably this is due to its plethora of benefits as a laboratory animal; however, it is important to note that unlike humans, melanocytes are not present at the dermal-epidermal junction in mice and mice do not develop melanoma without genetic manipulation. In contrast, there are numerous reports of animals that spontaneously develop melanoma, ranging from sharks and parrots to hippos and monkeys. In addition, several domesticated and laboratory-bred animals spontaneously develop melanoma or UV-induced melanoma, specifically, fish, opossums, pigs, horses, cats, and dogs.

For instance, reef shark species are thought to benefit from marine protected area networks, even though their movement behaviour remains poorly characterized. Poor understanding of species' movements implies that the benefits of MPA networks for species' populations are still widely unknown. To understand the consequences of movement behaviour for protection, we modelled movements of three reef shark species' (Carcharhinus albimarginatus,C. amblyrhynchosandC. leucas) with distinct levels of reef association using real passive-acoustic telemetry data. The model simulates if individuals are protected or unprotected by their movements in a system of reef patches in a network of MPAs. Model parameters that control individuals' movements were estimated from acoustic telemetry data. To estimate benefits for species we monitored longevity and time spent in protected habitats across all scenarios of reef protection, fishing intensity (11 values for each) and protection of high or low suitability reefs (a reef-dependent factor that attracts sharks to reside in it) for populations of 1,000 individuals per species. The time individuals spent in protected reefs increased linearly with protection until it levelled off after 50%-80% of reefs protected (78%C. amblyrhynchos, 72%C. albimarginatusand 52% C. leucas, at 100% protection). Individuals' life span decreased exponentially with fishing intensity. Reef protection only mildly counteracted life span lost to fishing. Protecting highly suitable reefs increased time spent in protected reefs, optimal protection was reached at a lower number of reefs protected, and life expectancy was higher with protection of highly suitable reefs. Synthesis and applications. Our framework can be applied to many studies using passive-acoustic telemetry to track animal movements. Protected area networks benefit species highly attached to protected sites. To increase benefits of marine protected area networks for all species (with low and high degrees of reef attachment) we need to understand the use of reef-adjacent areas, dispersal routes and characterize reef suitability for multiple species.",,,,,"Martin, Gerardo/0000-0003-3608-5328",,,,,,,,,,,,0021-8901,1365-2664,,,,OCT,2020,57,10,,,,,1969,1980,,10.1111/1365-2664.13706,,JUL 2020,,,,,WOS:000553283200001,,,,,,

Fossil skeletons of this group show that the overall morphology was well established earlier in its history. By examining the skull shape of well-preserved fossil material compared to extant angel sharks using geometric morphometric methods, within a phylogenetic framework, we were able to determine the conservative skull shape among angel sharks with a high degree of integration. The morphospace occupation of extant angel sharks is rather restricted, with extensive overlap. Most of the differences in skull shape are related to their geographic distribution patterns.

Hurricane Irene caused substantial economic damage when it hit the Mid-Atlantic Bight (MAB) off of the eastern United States in August of 2011. The MAB is highly stratified during the summer when a strong thermocline separates warm, surface water from deep, cold water, and this oceanographic phenomenon makes modeling hurricane strength difficult. Loggerhead sea turtles (Caretta caretta) forage in the MAB primarily during the stratified season and their dive behavior to the bottom allows them to experience the oceanographic conditions of the entire water column. Methods In this study, we analyzed the movements and dive behavior of juvenile and adult-sized loggerhead sea turtles (n = 18) that were foraging in the MAB as Hurricane Irene moved through the region. The satellite tags deployed on these turtles transmitted location data and dive behavior as well as sea surface temperature (SST) and temperature-depth profiles during this time. Results Behavioral and environmental shifts were observed during and after the hurricane compared to conditions before the storm. During the hurricane, most of the turtles (n = 15) moved north of their pre-storm foraging grounds. Following the storm, some turtles left their established foraging sites (n = 8) moving south by 7.3-135.0 km, and for the others that remained (n = 10), 12% of the observed dives were longer (0.54-1.11 h) than dives observed before the storm. The in situ data collected by the turtle-borne tags captured the cooling of the SST (Mean difference = 4.47 degrees C) and the deepening of the thermocline relative to the pre-storm conditions. Conclusions Some of the loggerhead behavior observed relative to a passing hurricane differed from the regular pattern of seasonal movement expected for turtles that forage in the MAB. These data documented the shifts in sea turtle behavior and distribution during an ecosystem-level perturbation and the recorded in situ data demonstrated that loggerheads observe environmental changes to the entire water column, including during extreme weather events.",,,,,"Crowe, Leah/0000-0001-9133-8522",,,,,,,,,,,,2051-3933,,,,,JUL 27,2020,8,1,,,,,,,32,10.1186/s40462-020-00218-6,,,,,,,WOS:000556326800001,32742661,,,,,

The markers were characterized in 35H. edwardsiispecimens and tested for cross-species utility inHaploblepharus fuscus,Haploblepharus pictus, and the more distantly related scyliorhinidHalaelurus natalensis.

Furthermore, interspecific genetic differentiation was examined to infer the potential use of these markers for species identification as well as for detecting signatures of admixture amongHaploblepharusspecies. All microsatellite markers were polymorphic in each species, with polymorphism information contents ranging from 0.43 to 0.62. Population differentiation was only evident forH. pictus, where genetic discontinuity was detected among geographically distant sampling sites. Statistically significant differentiation (fixation index between populationsF(ST)= 0.091 to 0.382) was found between all species; however, the level of differentiation betweenH. fuscusandH. pictuswas low in comparison and seemingly at a population level rather than at a species level. Species assignment using Bayesian clustering analysis resulted in approximately 57% of 88 genotyped specimens being unambiguously assigned to a distinct genetic cluster that confirmed accurate taxonomic assignment.

Theory predicts that faster-growing individuals suffer higher mortality and that this trade-off is mediated through exploration/risk-taking personality, but empirical support for this remains limited and ambiguous. Equivocal support to the POLS hypothesis suggests that the link between life history and personality may only emerge under certain circumstances. Understanding personality-driven trade-offs would be facilitated by long-term studies in wild populations experiencing different ecological conditions. Here, we tested whether personality measured in semi-captivity was associated with a growth-mortality trade-off via risk-taking in the wild in two subpopulations of juvenile lemon sharksNegaprion brevirostrisknown to differ in their predator abundance. We expected stronger personality-driven trade-offs in the predator-rich environment as compared to the predator-poor environment. Sharks were captured yearly from 1995 onwards allowing us to obtain long-term data on growth and apparent survival in each subpopulation. We then used a novel open-field assay to test sharks for exploration personality yearly from 2012 to 2017. A subset of the tested sharks was monitored in the field using telemetry to document risk-taking behaviours. We tested (a) if fast explorers in captivity took more risks and grew faster in the wild and (b) if natural selection acted against more explorative, faster-growing sharks. In the subpopulation with fewer predators, more explorative sharks in captivity took more risks in the wild and grew faster. In turn, larger, fast-growing sharks had lower apparent survival. In the predator-rich subpopulation, despite finding selection on fast growth, we found no link between exploration personality and the growth-mortality trade-off. Our study demonstrates that the association between personality and life history is favoured in some ecological contexts but not in others. We identify predator and resource abundance as two main potential drivers of the personality-mediated trade-off and emphasize that future work on the POLS hypothesis would benefit from an approach integrating behaviour and life history across ecological conditions.",,,,,"Dhellemmes, Felicie/0000-0002-2043-4653",,,,,,,,,,,,0021-8790,1365-2656,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1111/1365-2656.13283,,JUL 2020,,,,,WOS:000552630000001,32720305,,,,,

Sarawak swellshark Cephaloscyllium sarawakensis of the family Scyliorhinidae from the South China Sea performs a new mode of oviparity, which is named sustained single oviparity, characterized by a lengthy retention of a single egg case in an oviduct until the embryo attains a sizable length. The resulting fecundity of the Sarawak swellshark within a season is quite low, but this disadvantage is balanced by smaller body, larger neonates and quicker maturation. The Sarawak swellshark is further uniquely characterized by having glassy transparent egg cases, and this is correlated with a vivid polka-dot pattern of the embryos.

Although molecular barcoding may be the fastest choice to determine the identity of a given species, robust and fast species level identification in the field using morphological characters is essential. During this study, 389 specimens representing seven stingray species (Brevitrygon walga, Himantura leoparda, H. uarnak, Maculabatis randalli, M. arabica, M. gerrardi and Pateobatis fai) were examined from the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman. A 1044 bp fragment of the NADH2 gene was generated for 50 specimens with representatives of all species. To verify the initial morphological identification and to compare intra-and interspecific differences a Neighbor-Joining analysis was conducted using uncorrected p-distances, whereas the Bayesian Inference was used to examine the relationships among taxa. Two species (M. arabica and M. gerrardi) are documented from the Persian Gulf for the first time. The molecular results provide the first known evidence of the sympatric distribution of M. randalli and M. arabica in the north and northwestern Indian Ocean. The results of the Bayesian Inference support the recent divergence of both species. Based on morphological comparisons and molecular support we suggest that the descriptions of M. randalli and M. arabica have been carried out on heterogeneous type series which has led to inconsistency between molecular identification and diagnostic morphological characteristics. Detailed morphological examination revealed that there is a relation between the type and number of denticles on the mid-dorsal surface of the disc and the color pattern of the tail. To address this taxonomic conflict all type materials should be re-examined. The Bayesian Inference tree showed that all specimens from the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman morphologically resembling B. walga were found to group well outside those of the Indian species (B. imbricata) with an average p-distance of 0.097.

Decades of overexploitation have devastated shark populations, leaving considerable doubt as to their ecological status(1,2). Yet much of what is known about sharks has been inferred from catch records in industrial fisheries, whereas far less information is available about sharks that live in coastal habitats(3). Here we address this knowledge gap using data from more than 15,000 standardized baited remote underwater video stations that were deployed on 371 reefs in 58 nations to estimate the conservation status of reef sharks globally. Our results reveal the profound impact that fishing has had on reef shark populations: we observed no sharks on almost 20% of the surveyed reefs. Reef sharks were almost completely absent from reefs in several nations, and shark depletion was strongly related to socio-economic conditions such as the size and proximity of the nearest market, poor governance and the density of the human population. However, opportunities for the conservation of reef sharks remain: shark sanctuaries, closed areas, catch limits and an absence of gillnets and longlines were associated with a substantially higher relative abundance of reef sharks. These results reveal several policy pathways for the restoration and management of reef shark populations, from direct top-down management of fishing to indirect improvement of governance conditions. Reef shark populations will only have a high chance of recovery by engaging key socio-economic aspects of tropical fisheries.",,,,"Garla, Ricardo C/A-2990-2014; Ledee, Elodie/X-1537-2019; Scharer-Umpierre, Michelle/R-2318-2019; MacNeil, M.

In order to solve the MCDM issues, a better way is provided by the fuzzy logic. Expendability, cost, maintenance, availability of software, and performance characteristics are such problems considered by the decision. The precise estimation of the pertinent data is one of the vital phases in DM systems. This paper presents a fuzzy MCDM-based cluster head (CH) selection and hybrid routing protocol to solve the most common issues. In this research article, the generalized intuitionistic fuzzy soft set (GIFSS) approach is utilized to select the optimal CH, and hybrid shark smell optimization (SSO), and a genetic algorithm (GA) is introduced for the effective routing. Initially, the wireless sensor network (WSN) system and energy models are designed, and then the nodes are grouped into several clusters. Next, based on the GIFSS, the CH nodes are selected, and finally, an effective routing is placed based on the hybrid optimizations. The implementation is performed on the NS2 platform, and the performances are evaluated by packet delivery ratio (PDR), delay, packet loss ratio (PLR), network lifetime, bit error rate (BER), energy consumption, throughput, and jitter. The existing approaches named energy centers examining using particle swarm optimization (EC-PSO), variable dimension-based PSO (VD-PSO), energy-efficient PSO-based CH selection (PSO-ECHS), low-energy adaptive clustering hierarchy-sugeno fuzzy (LEACH-SF), SSO, and GA are compared with the proposed strategy.

Florida's Indian River Lagoon (IRL), an estuary of national significance, has experienced many anthropogenic impacts in recent decades, such as habitat degradation and declining water quality, and there is a substantial data gap surrounding the status of elasmobranchs in this system. A fishery-independent survey (longline/gillnet) was implemented to characterize the elasmobranch community and understand distribution patterns and habitat use in the IRL (Sebastian to St. Lucie Inlet). From July 2016 to June 2018, 630 individuals of 16 species were caught and tagged, including two critically endangered smalltooth sawfishPristis pectinata. Bull sharksCarcharhinus leucasand Atlantic stingraysHypanus sabinuswere the two most common species collected (47% of the total catch), and size differences by region were observed. The longline catch exhibited a significant difference in species composition among regions while the gillnet catch composition significantly varied among seasons. Although dependent on survey gear type, there was evidence of combinations of abiotic parameters (e.g., depth, salinity, water clarity, distance to a freshwater source, distance to an inlet) driving elasmobranch species composition. Bull sharks and Atlantic stingrays dominated areas with frequently low salinities while more diverse assemblages of species were apparent towards inlet passes. This study provides the first in-depth analysis of the elasmobranch community in the IRL and develops capacity to understand how these species may respond to further environmental changes in this highly impacted estuary.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1559-2723,1559-2731,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1007/s12237-020-00804-2,,JUL 2020,,,,,WOS:000549820700002,,,,,,

This study aimed to compare eDNA detection against well-established seasonal changes in blacktip shark (Carcharhinus limbatus) abundance in Terra Ceia Bay (FL, USA). We used a species-specific real-time PCR approach to detect C. limbatus eDNA in the bay on a near monthly basis from spring through mid-fall in 2018 and 2019. Previous studies have shown that C. limbatus give birth in the bay in early summer and immature sharks occur there until late fall, when decreasing water temperatures cause them to move offshore and southwards. Water samples (2 L) were collected (4-6 per month) and filtered in the field, with each then being subjected to real-time PCR. Carcharhinus limbatus 'positive' filters were significantly more commonly collected during the April-July sampling period than during the August-October sampling period. While following the predicted pattern, eDNA concentration was generally too low for accurate quantification. Our results show that C. limbatus eDNA detection follows known seasonal residency patterns consistently over 2 years of monitoring. Species-specific eDNA analysis using real-time PCR could therefore represent a cost-effective, scalable sampling tool to facilitate improved shark population monitoring in semi-enclosed marine habitats.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2045-2322,,,,,JUL 16,2020,10,1,,,,,,,,10.1038/s41598-020-68843-0,,,,,,,WOS:000550057200160,32678294,,,,,

The patterns and processes that resulted in smoothhound biodiversity and present-day distribution remain largely unknown. We infer the phylogenetic relationships of the genusMustelus, based on sequence data (3474 bp) from three mitochondrial genes (CR, NADH-2 and 12S-16SrRNA) and a nuclear gene (KBTBD2) from seven species ofMustelusdistributed across the eastern Atlantic- and Indo-Pacific oceans. Using the CR and KBTBD2 dataset, we infer the phylogeographic placement of Old WorldMustelus,with particular reference to species from southern Africa. Using a near-complete phylogeny of the genus including Old World and New World species ofMustelusand publicly available sequences of the NADH-2 gene, we found supporting evidence indicating a major cladogenic event separating placental and aplacental species. Biogeographical analyses further revealed that the radiation ofMustelusin the southern African region was driven primarily by long-distance dispersal during the upper Miocene to lower Pleistocene. The placement of the placental blackspotted smoothhoundMustelus punctulatusat the base of the placental non-spotted clade suggests the secondary loss of black spots in the genus, and this was also supported by the ancestral state reconstruction.

Recent studies demonstrate the presence of sleep in flatworms and jellyfish, suggesting that this behaviour evolved early in the evolution of animals. Sharks are the earliest known extant, jawed vertebrates and may play an important role in understanding the evolutionary history of sleep in vertebrates, and yet, it is unknown whether they sleep. The Port Jackson (Heterodontus portusjacksoni) and draughtsboard (Cephaloscyllium isabellum) sharks are both benthic, buccal pumping species and remain motionless for extended periods of time. Whether these periods of prolonged inactivity represent sleep or quiet wakefulness is unknown. A key criterion for separating sleep from other quiescent states is an increased arousal threshold. We show here that inactive sharks of both species require significantly higher levels of electric stimulation before they show a visible response. Sharks deprived of rest, however, show no significant compensatory increase in restfulness during their normal active period following enforced swimming. Nonetheless, increased arousal thresholds in inactive animals suggest that these two species of shark sleep - the first such demonstration for members of this group of vertebrates.

While all life stages of tiger sharks are known to occur in the Gulf of Mexico (GoM), variability in habitat use and movement patterns over ontogeny have never been quantified in this large marine ecosystem. To address this data gap we fitted 56 tiger sharks with Smart Position and Temperature transmitting tags between 2010 and 2018 and examined seasonal and spatial distribution patterns across the GoM. Additionally, we analyzed overlap of core habitats (i.e., 50% kernel density estimates) among individuals relative to large benthic features (oil and gas platforms, natural banks, bathymetric breaks). Our analyses revealed significant ontogenetic and seasonal differences in distribution patterns as well as across-shelf (i.e., regional) and sex-linked variability in movement rates. Presumably sub-adult and adult sharks achieved significantly higher movement rates and used off-shelf deeper habitats at greater proportions than juvenile sharks, particularly during the fall and winter seasons. Further, female maximum rate of movement was higher than males when accounting for size. Additionally, we found evidence of core regions encompassing the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration designated Habitat Areas of Particular Concern (i.e., shelf-edge banks) during cooler months, particularly by females, as well as 2,504 oil and gas platforms. These data provide a baseline for future assessments of environmental impacts, such as climate variability or oil spills, on tiger shark movements and distribution in the region.

India has one of the highest elasmobranch landings globally, through both targeted catch and bycatch. As elasmobranchs contribute to food and livelihood security, there is a need for holistic approaches to bycatch mitigation. We adopt an interdisciplinary approach to critically assess a range of hypothetical measures for reducing elasmobranch capture in a trawler fishery on India's west coast, using a risk-based mitigation hierarchy framework. Data were collected through landing surveys, interviews and a literature review, to assess the following potential management options for their technical effectiveness and socio-economic feasibility: (1) spatio-temporal closures; (2) net restrictions; (3) bycatch reduction devices (BRDs); and (4) live onboard release. Our study provides the first evidence-based and nuanced understanding of elasmobranch bycatch management for this fishery, and suggestions for future conservation and research efforts. Onboard release may be viable for species like guitarfish, with moderate chances of survival, and was the favored option among interview respondents due to minimal impact on earnings. While closures, net restrictions and BRDs may reduce elasmobranch capture, implementation will be challenging under present circumstances due to the potentially high impact on fisher income. Interventions for live release can therefore be used as a step toward ameliorating bycatch, while initiating longer-term engagement with the fishing community. Participatory monitoring can help address critical knowledge gaps in elasmobranch ecology. Spatio-temporal closures and gear restriction measures may then be developed through a bottom-up approach in the long term. Overall, the framework facilitated a holistic assessment of bycatch management to guide decision-making. Scaling-up and integrating such case studies across different species, fisheries and sites would support the formulation of a meaningful management plan for elasmobranch fisheries in India.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2296-7745,,,,JUL 15,2020,7,,,,,,,,571,10.3389/fmars.2020.00571,,,,,,,WOS:000550283100001,,,,,,

Morphological dental changes through ontogeny have been identified in several species and have been correlated with shifts in diet and the acquisition of sexual maturity. However, these changes were rarely quantified in detail along multiple ontogenetic stages, which makes it difficult to infer the developmental processes responsible for the observed plasticity. In this work, we use micro-computed tomography and 3D geometric morphometrics to describe and analyze the tooth size and shape diversity across three ontogenetic stages (hatchling, juvenile, and sexually mature) in the large-spotted catsharkScyliorhinus stellaris(Linnaeus, 1758). We first describe the intra-individual variation of tooth form for each sex at each ontogenetic stage. We provide a tooth morphospace for palatoquadrate and Meckelian teeth and identify dental features, such as relative size and number of cusps, involved in the range of variation of the observed morphologies. We then use these shape data to draw developmental trajectories between ontogenetic stages and for each tooth position within the jaw to characterize ontogenetic patterns of sexual dimorphism.

The current study was aimed to comparatively evaluate the effects of spring and autumn extracts of A. aucheri Bioss on Leishmania major both in-vitro and in-vivo conditions. Methods: HPLC analysis was used to evaluate the percentages of compounds in spring and autumn extracts of A. aucheri. For in-vitro assay, the effect of different concentrations of spring and autumn extracts of A. aucheri was tested on L. major promastigotes and amastigotes. MTT and flow cytometry methods were used to evaluate the cytotoxicity and probable apoptosis of A. aucheri extracts on L. major promastigotes. On the other hand, for invivo assay, the extracts were used as ointments to treat lesions developed on BALB/c mice after 28 days post inoculation of L. major. The diameter of lesions and the survival rates of infected BALB/c mice were measured weekly for a period of two months. Results: The HPLC analysis showed the substance Quercitrin was present in the spring A. aucheri extract but not in the autumn extract. The mean numbers of amastigotes in each treated macrophage with the spring and autumn A. aucheri extracts were 1.2 and 1.8 respectively, which showed statistically significant differences (P < 0.05). Flow cytometry revealed that the spring and autumn A. aucheri extracts caused about 32% and 3.78% apoptosis respectively. The inhibitory concentration (IC50) of spring and autumn A. aucheri extracts to amastigotes were determined to be 90 mu g/mL and 183 mu g/mL respectiovely. In-vivo, the diameter of lesions treated with the spring A. aucheri extract was significantly less (P < 0.05) compared to those treated with the autumn extract (2.6 and 7.8 mm respectively). Also, mice treated with spring A. aucheri extract had higher survival rates compared to control group. Conclusion: Given the above results, it can be concluded that spring A. aucheri extract has a greater fatality effect on L. major promastigotes in-vitro compared to the autum extract. In addition, the spring extract has stronger therapeutic effect on lesions caused by L. major in BALB/c mice than the autum extract.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0378-8741,1872-7573,,,,JUL 15,2020,257,,,,,,,,112910,10.1016/j.jep.2020.112910,,,,,,,WOS:000538156200041,32344159,,,,,

From data mining, we found a novel prmt8e6 + 43 splicing variant with a 43-nucleotide (nt) extension at the 5' of exon 6 in chicken. RT-PCR analyses confirmed the existence of two splicing variants but also detected a third upper signal. The triplet pattern detected in chicken suggests that one strand from the prmt8e6 + 43 transcript and one strand from the regular splicing products form a heteroduplex with a bulb conformation and the two transcripts are of similar abundance. One short plus one faint upper heteroduplex signal detected in mouse and human indicate that the level of the variant is much less than the normal one in mammals. The relative expression of the normal and prmt8e6 + 43 variants in different species can be inferred from the reads of intron 5 that contains the 43-nt extension or not in the RNA-seq data of NCBI Gene database. The results of the analyses showed that the prmt8e6 + 43 variant is relatively abundant in birds but much less or even not detected in mammalian species. As conserved intron 5 sequences and evidences of alternative splicing (AS) are detected in elephant shark, a cartilaginous fish with the slowest-evolving genome, we propose that the prmt8e6 + 43 variant is present in the common ancestor of jawed vertebrates. The prmt8e6 + 43 variant includes a premature termination codon and thus should encode a truncated PRMT8 with deletion from the dimerization arm. Western blot analyses showed very weak low-molecular-weight signals in chicken, which might be the C-terminal truncated PRMT8.

A rapid decline in richness across all body locations was observed within 1 month of captivity, with tank-acclimated (>2 years) animals having <5% of the initial microbiome richness and a nearly completely restructured microbial community. Tank-acclimated horseshoe crabs possessed distinct microbiomes that were highly uneven and low in species richness on the carapace (31 +/- 7 ASVs), cloaca (53 +/- 19 ASVs), gills (17 +/- 2 ASVs), and oral cavity (31 +/- 13 ASVs). The carapace, oral cavity, and gills of the tank-acclimated animals hosted abundant populations ofAeromonas(>60%) andPseudomonas(>20%), both of which are known opportunistic pathogens of aquatic animals and can express chitinases, providing a plausible mechanism for the development of the carapace lesion pathology observed in this and other studies. The cloaca of the tank-acclimated animals was slightly more diverse than the other body locations withAeromonas,Enterococcus,Shewanella, andVagococcusdominating the community.

Sharks are high trophic level predators that play a key role in the regulation of ecosystem structure and health. Because many sharks are already threatened, it is especially important to understand the impact of climate change on these species. We used shark occurrence records collected by commercial fisheries within the Australian continental Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) to predict changes in future (2050-2099) relative to current (1956-2005) habitat suitability for pelagic sharks based on an ensemble of climate models and emission scenarios. Our predictive models indicate that future sea temperatures are likely to shift the location of suitable shark habitat within the Australian EEZ. On average, suitable habitat is predicted to decrease within the EEZ for requiem and increase for mackerel sharks, however, the direction and severity of change was highly influenced by the choice of climate model.

Estuaries provide essential habitat for many fishes, including elasmobranchs, particularly as nurseries. Shore-based, gillnet surveys have documented ten elasmobranch species (sharks and batoids) inhabiting Texas estuaries; however, limitations in the methodology, spatial, and temporal scope employed mean the role of these estuaries as elasmobranch nurseries remains uncertain. Therefore, an alternative sampling technique was implemented to survey open water locations in two Texas estuaries during the peak time of putative elasmobranch nursery usage (May to October). Ten species of elasmobranch were observed, including a shark,Carcharhinus porosus, and batoid species,Hypanus americanus, that were not documented in previous surveys. The most commonly encountered species,Carcharhinus brevipinna, comprised 45% of individuals caught, in contrast to previous surveys of these estuaries, in which the species was less than 1% of the total elasmobranch catch. The results revealed a distinction between sharks and batoids in terms of the life history stages present, as well as the depths and distances from the tidal inlet of areas in which they were encountered. Young-of-the-year and small juvenileCarcharhinus brevipinnaandSphyrna lewiniwere observed across multiple years and in multiple months within years at one site, suggesting that one of the sampled estuaries functions as a nursery.

M. alfredi were photographed within six of the seven Island Groups of Seychelles, with 64% of individuals being resighted at least once between July 2006 and December 2019 over timeframes of 1-3,462 days (9.5 years; median = 1,018 days).

Satellite-tracked M. alfredi (n = 5 tracks; maximum 180 days) remained within the boundary of the Seychelles Exclusive Economic Zone, where they spent the majority of their time (87%) in the upper 50 m of the water column in close proximity to the Amirantes Bank. The inclusion of acoustic tagging data in the models of estimated satellite-track paths significantly reduced the errors associated with the geolocation positions derived from archived light level data.

Catch rates of bigeye tuna, the main target species (Kingman/Palmyra MPA, causal effect probability >99% of an 84% reduction; 95% credible interval: -143%, -25%), and blue shark (Johnston MPAs, causal effect probability >95%) were significantly lower and longnose lancetfish significantly higher (Johnston MPAs, causal effect probability >95%) than predicted had the MPAs not been established, possibly from closing areas near shallow features, which aggregate pelagic predators, and from 'fishing-the-line'. There were no apparent causal impacts of the MPAs on species diversity, lengths and trophic level of the catch, perhaps because the MPAs were young, were too small, did not contain critical habitat for specific life-history stages, had been lightly exploited or experienced fishing-the-line. We also assessed model-standardized catch rates for species of conservation concern and mean trophic level of the catch within and outside of MPAs. Displaced effort produced multi-species conflicts: MPAs protect bycatch hotspots and hotspots of bycatch-to-target catch ratios for some at-risk species, but coldspots for others. Mean trophic level of the catch was significantly higher around MPAs, likely due to the aggregating effect of the shallow features and there having been light fishing pressure within MPAs.

With characteristic dimensions less than 1 mm, the trapping structures are among the smallest known to capture prey by suction, a mechanism that is not effective in the creeping-flow regime where viscous forces prevent the generation of fast and energy-efficient suction flows. To understand what makes suction feeding possible on the small scale of bladderwort traps, we characterised their suction flows experimentally (using particle image velocimetry) and mathematically (using computational fluid dynamics and analytical mathematical models). We show that bladderwort traps avoid the adverse effects of creeping flow by generating strong, fast-onset suction pressures. Our findings suggest that traps use three morphological adaptations: the trap walls' fast release of elastic energy ensures strong and constant suction pressure; the trap door's fast opening ensures effectively instantaneous onset of suction; the short channel leading into the trap ensures undeveloped flow, which maintains a wide effective channel diameter. Bladderwort traps generate much stronger suction flows than larval fish with similar gape sizes because of the traps' considerably stronger suction pressures. However, bladderworts' ability to generate strong suction flows comes at considerable energetic expense.",,,,Li/O-7610-2019,"Li/0000-0002-4423-3266; Schwaner, M.

The sightings, behaviours, and pictures used for photographic identification were obtained during August to November 2012-2014 onboard tourist boats in Guadalupe Island, Mexico. Four types of baits were used: (1) frozen bait; (2) frozen bait and natural chum; (3) fresh fish bait; and (4) mackerel bags. Data were analysed according to sex, maturity and the total of sharks using 6,145 sightings of 121 white sharks. The type of bait showed no significant difference on the effectiveness to attracting sharks. Ethological analysis showed that the type of bait had a significant effect on the shark's surface behaviour during its interactions with boats. Natural chum and fresh baits showed short term behavioural patterns constituted by increased number of violent interactions with the bait, while the frozen bait did not generate a defined behavioural pattern. Conditioning of white sharks was determined by the number of interactions and the consumption frequency of the bait. Fifty nine percent of sharks (n=41) showed no conditioning, 36% (n=25) showed a low risk and only 5% (n=3) were found to have a high risk of conditioning. The results suggest that current ecotourism has no effect on the conditioning of the white sharks, and that all baits have a similar effectiveness for attracting the sharks.

Furthermore, little is known of the extent of spatial congruency between biodiversity measures in the marine realm. Here, we used the distribution maps of all known marine sharks, rays, and chimaeras (class Chondrichthyes) to examine the extent of spatial congruency across the hotspots of three measures of species richness: total number of species, evolutionarily distinct species, and endemic species. We assessed the spatial congruency between hotspots considering all species, as well as on the subset of the threatened species only. We consider three definitions of hotspot (2.5%, 5%, and 10% of cells with the highest numbers of species) and three levels of spatial resolution (1 degrees, 4 degrees, and 8 degrees grid cells). Overall, we found low congruency among all three measures of species richness, with the threatened species comprising a smaller subset of the overall species patterns irrespective of hotspot definition. Areas of congruency at 1 degrees and 5% richest cells contain over half (64%) of all sharks and rays and occurred off the coasts of: (1) Northern Mexico Gulf of California, (2) USA Gulf of Mexico, (3) Ecuador, (4) Uruguay and southern Brazil, (5) South Africa, southern Mozambique, and southern Namibia, (6) Japan, Taiwan, and parts of southern China, and (7) eastern and western Australia. Coarsening resolution increases congruency two-fold for all species but remains relatively low for threatened measures, and geographic locations of congruent areas also change. Finally, for pairwise comparisons of biodiversity measures, evolutionarily distinct species richness had the highest overlap with total species richness regardless of resolution or definition of hotspot. We suggest that focusing conservation attention solely on areas of high total species richness will not necessarily contribute efforts towards species that are most at risk, nor will it protect other important dimensions of species richness.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1932-6203,,,,,JUL 6,2020,15,7,,,,,,,,10.1371/journal.pone.0235559; 10.1371/journal.pone.0235559.r001; 10.1371/journal.pone.0235559.r002; 10.1371/journal.pone.0235559.r003; 10.1371/journal.pone.0235559.r004; 10.1371/journal.pone.0235559.r005; 10.1371/journal.pone.0235559.r006,,,,,,,WOS:000550068700044,,,,,,

A promising HCV vaccine using chimpanzee adenoviral vectors (ChAd) encoding a genotype (gt) 1b non-structural protein (ChAd-Gt1b-NS) generated high magnitude T cell responses. However, these T cells showed reduced cross-recognition of dominant epitope variants and the vaccine has recently been shown to be ineffective at preventing chronic HCV. To address the challenge of viral diversity, we developed ChAd vaccines encoding HCV genomic sequences that are conserved between all major HCV genotypes and adjuvanted by truncated shark invariant chain (sli(tr)). Methods: Age-matched female mice were immunised intramuscularly with ChAd (10(8) infectious units) encoding gt-1 and -3 (ChAd-Gt1/3) or gt-1 to -6 (ChAd-Gt1-6) conserved segments spanning the HCV proteome, or gt-1b (ChAd-Gt1b-NS control), with immunogenicity assessed 14-days post-vaccination. Results: Conserved segment vaccines, ChAd-Gt1/3 and ChAd-Gt1-6, generated high-magnitude, broad, and functional CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cell responses. Compared to the ChAd-Gt1b-NS vaccine, these vaccines generated significantly greater responses against conserved non-gt-1 antigens, including conserved subdominant epitopes that were not targeted by ChAd-Gt1b-NS. Epitopes targeted by the conserved segment HCV vaccine induced T cells, displayed 96.6% mean sequence homology between all HCV subtypes (100% sequence homology for the majority of genotype-1, -2, -4 sequences and 94% sequence homology for gt-3, -6, -7, and -8) in contrast to 85.1% mean sequence homology for epitopes targeted by ChAd-Gt1b-NS induced T cells. The addition of truncated shark invariant chain (sli(tr)) increased the magnitude, breadth, and cross-reactivity of the T cell response. Conclusions: We have demonstrated that genetically adjuvanted ChAd vectored HCV T cell vaccines encoding genetic sequences conserved between genotypes are immunogenic, activating T cells that target subdominant conserved HCV epitopes. These pre-clinical studies support the use of conserved segment HCV T cell vaccines in human clinical trials.

In this study we provide one of the first assessments of the trophic ecology of the vulnerable smooth-hounds Mustelus mustelus and M. punctulatus in the Central Mediterranean Sea, based on stomach contents and stable isotope analyses. Ontogenetic diet changes were addressed by comparing the feeding habits of three groups of individuals: juveniles, maturing and adults. Our results highlighted that the two species share a similar diet based mostly on the consumption of benthic crustaceans (e.g. hermit crabs). Their trophic level increases during ontogeny, with adults increasing their consumption of large-sized crustaceans (e.g. Calappa granulata, Palinurus elephas), cephalopods (e.g. Octopus vulgaris) and fish (e.g. Trachurus trachurus). Our results provide also evidence of ontogenetic shifts in diet for both species showing a progressive reduction of interspecific trophic overlap during growth.

The question of whether Australian estuaries have a Hg contamination problem is addressed. The Hg concentrations in fish, excluding sharks, tuna, barramundi and some stingrays, in estuaries and near-shore ecosystems with no discernable pollution sources are typically below 0.5 mg/kg wet weight, the level of health concern. There is no relationship of Hg concentration with fish size or age nor any evidence of biomagnification. In locations with historic large discrete Hg input sources (e.g. Derwent Estuary, Tasmania, Princess Royal Harbour WA, Port Phillip Bay Vic, Sydney sewage outfalls NSW), Hg concentrations in some sediment-dwelling fish such as flatheads exceed the health limit of 0.5 mg/kg. In this paper, we also review, within an Australian context, the biogeochemical processes controlling the formation and accumulation of methyl mercury (MeHg). On entering waterways, Hg rapidly partitions to particulate matter and deposits into sediments. The remobilisation of Hg from sediment is dependent on the formation of MeHg by bacteria and ultimately the interplay of 5, Fe and Se cycling. Fish species that move and feed in different areas have Hg concentrations that do not reflect the sediment Hg concentrations where they are caught, i.e. there is an uncoupling of diet and potential Hg exposure.

Detailed measurements of their length show that they are exceptionally long and unusually continuous. The Great Southern Scarp is the southern edge of the Nullarbor Plain's Bunda Plateau; it is cut into shallow marine sediments and extends for 820 km. Once a continuous sea-cliff, local uplift has isolated two sections from the ocean, so it now comprises the Bunda Cliffs (210 km of coastal cliff, 180 km of which is uninterrupted cliff line), Hampton Range (inland; 300 km), Baxter Cliffs (160 km of coastal cliff) and Wylie Scarp (inland; 160 km). The Zuytdorp Cliffs are coastal cliffs cut into eolianite, and extend for 210 km with an uninterrupted section of 120 km. The length of the Great Southern Scarp and the Zuytdorp Cliffs results from an unusual combination of circumstances. They are both composed of poorly jointed, relatively homogenous biogenic calcarenites, presented to high-energy ocean waves by regional uplift. The carbonates are sufficiently well cemented to maintain a steep vertical cliff face, but susceptible to disintegration under direct wave attack. Cliff retreat has been fairly uniform because of the broad spatial scale of both lithology and erosion. The arid climate, absence of nearby nonkarstic catchments and karstic nature of the cliffs' hinterlands has discouraged integrated drainage development, so no significant fluvial systems dissect the cliffs; this is a key factor in cliff edge preservation. In the case of the Great Southern Scarp, these processes have formed the longest continuous cliff line in Australia and probably the world. Referenced against criteria from Australia's National Heritage List, the cliffs have potentially international/national levels of significance for the rarity of their scale, their demonstration of landscape evolution, and their spectacular beauty.",,,,"Webb, John/B-2479-2012","Webb, John/0000-0002-6357-5966",,,,,,,,,,,,0812-0099,1440-0952,,,,JUL 3,2020,67,5,,,,,649,661,,10.1080/08120099.2020.1742202,,,,,,,WOS:000531056200002,,,,,,

However, a recently reported chondrichthyan tooth assemblage from the Early Cretaceous of France suggests that cladodontomorphs might have survived the catastrophic events at the Permian-Triassic boundary, probably by occupying deep-sea refuge environments. Here, we describe two new chondrichthyan genera based on isolated teeth recovered from Valanginian (Early Cretaceous) deep-water deposits of Austria, including a total of three new species tentatively assigned to the cladodontomorph families Falcatidae (Cretacladoides ogiveformisgen. et sp. nov. andC. noricumsp. nov.) and Ctenacanthidae (Natarapax trivortexgen. et sp. nov.).

The Pacific spiny dogfish can experience and tolerate reduced environmental salinities, yet how this environmental challenge may affect the microbiome, and consequently nitrogen transport across the gut, is as of yet unknown. In the present study, excised gut sac preparations were made from dogfish acclimated to the following: full-strength seawater (C), low salinity for 7 days (LS), and after acute transfer of LS-acclimated fish to full-strength SW for 6 h (AT). Significantly reduced microbial derived urease activity was observed in the mucosal saline of gut sac preparations from the LS (by 81%) and AT (by 89%) treatments relative to the C treatment. Microbial derived cellulase activity from mucosal saline samples tended to follow similar patterns. To further ensure an effective decrease in the spiral valve microbial population, an antibiotic cocktail was applied to the mucosal saline used for in vitro measurements of ion, water, and nitrogen flux in these gut sac preparations. This caused a further 57-61% decrease in the mucosal saline urease activity of the C and LS treatments. Overall, we observed relatively little flux across the stomach for all measured parameters aside from water movement, which switched from a net efflux in control fish to a net influx in acutely transferred fish, indicative of drinking. While no significant differences were observed in terms of nitrogen flux (urea or ammonia), we tended to see the accumulation of ammonia in the spiral valve lumen and a switch from efflux to influx of urea in control versus acutely transferred fish. The increased ammonia production likely occurs as a result of heightened metabolism in a challenging environment, while the retention and acquisition of urea is suggestive of nitrogen scavenging under nitrogen-limiting conditions.",,,,"Weinrauch, Alyssa/AAX-9259-2020","Weinrauch, Alyssa/0000-0001-5710-0035; Folkerts, Erik/0000-0003-2400-0972",,,,,,,,,,,,0174-1578,1432-136X,,,,SEP,2020,190,5,,,,,535,545,,10.1007/s00360-020-01291-4,,JUL 2020,,,,,WOS:000545048800002,32617717,,,,,

The present report is the first one to provide data on the MyHC isoform distribution in the myocardium of the atrioventricular junction in chondrichthyans, specifically in the lesser spotted dogfish,Scyliorhinus canicula, a shark species whose heart reflects the primitive cardiac anatomical design in gnathostomes. Hearts from five dogfish were examined using histochemical and immunohistochemical techniques. The anti-MyHC A4.1025 antibody was used to detect differences in the occurrence of MyHC isoforms in the dogfish, as the fast-twitch isoforms MYH2 and MYH6 have a higher affinity for this antibody than the slow-twitch isoforms MYH7 and MYH7B. The histochemical findings show that myocardium of the atrioventricular junction connects the trabeculated myocardium of the atrium with the trabeculated layer of the ventricular myocardium. The immunohistochemical results indicate that the distribution of MyHC isoforms in the atrioventricular junction is not homogeneous. The atrial portion of the atrioventricular myocardium shows a positive reactivity against the A4.1025 antibody similar to that of the atrial myocardium. In contrast, the ventricular portion of the atrioventricular junction is not labelled, as is the case with the ventricular myocardium. This dual condition suggests that the myocardium of the atrioventricular junction has two contraction patterns: the myocardium of the atrial portion contracts in line with the atrial myocardium, whereas that of the ventricular portion follows the contraction pattern of the ventricular myocardium. Thus, the transition of the contraction wave from the atrium to the ventricle may be established in the atrioventricular segment because of its heterogeneous MyHC isoform distribution. The findings support the hypothesis that a distinct MyHC isoform distribution in the atrioventricular myocardium enables a synchronous contraction of inflow and outflow cardiac segments in vertebrates lacking a specialized cardiac conduction system.",,,,"Lopez-Unzu, Miguel A./B-5911-2017","Lopez-Unzu, Miguel A./0000-0002-8538-0713",,,,,,,,,,,,0022-1112,1095-8649,,,,SEP,2020,97,3,,,,,734,739,,10.1111/jfb.14427,,JUL 2020,,,,,WOS:000544819700001,32515493,,,,,

In this study, we aimed to fabricate a biologically functional ECM powder suspension from porcine articular cartilage that inhibits neovascularization (NV). Methods: The digested-cartilage acellular matrix (dg-CAM) was prepared by sequential processes of decellularization, enzymatic digestion and pulverization. Physicochemical properties of dg-CAM were compared with that of native cartilage tissue (NCT). Cellular interactions between human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and dg-CAM was evaluated with proliferation, migration and tube formation assays compared with that of type I collagen (COL) and bevacizumab, an anti-angiogenic drug. We then investigated the therapeutic potential of topical administration of dg-CAM suspension on the experimentally induced rabbit corneal NV model. Results: The dg-CAM released a significantly larger amount of soluble proteins than that of the NCT and showed an improved hydrophilic and dispersion properties. In contrast, the dg-CAM contained a large amount of collagen, glycosaminoglycans and anti-angiogenic molecules as much as the NCT. The inhibitory effect on NV of the dg-CAM was more prominent than that of COL and even comparable to that of bevacizumab in inhibiting the HUVECs. The therapeutic potential of the dg-CAM was comparable to that of bevacizumab in the rabbit corneal NV model by efficiently inhibiting neovessel formation of the injured cornea.

In total, 94 species were recorded (60.6% of Brazil elasmobranch biodiversity and 8% of the world), with 11 new records compared to the most recent study, distributed into 10 orders and 30 families. A total of 58 species of sharks were listed, most of them belonging to the order Carcharhiniformes (41.4%), followed by Squaliformes (27.6%), and 36 rays mainly of the orders Rajiformes (50.0%) and Myliobatiformes (30.5%). Concerning their conservation status, 26.6, 38.3 and 45.8% of the species are threatened (CR, EN, VU), at the regional, national and international levels, respectively.

Subsequent morphological analyses, however, rejected Maisey's scheme, which was left aside for nearly two decades until the first molecular phylogenies began to cluster again the orbitostylic sharks into a monophyletic group. In a broad comparative investigation of the anatomy of the appendicular skeleton of cartilaginous fishes, we discovered new evidence supporting the monophyly of squalomorph sharks: the presence of a posterior process at the lateral region of the coracoid bar serving as a origin site for the depressor pectoralis II muscle.

The model is developed as a long-run optimisation model to identify target reference points to achieve multispecies maximum economic yield, and a dynamic recursive optimisation model, which includes more realistic representation of fishers' behaviour, such as discards and trading of under-caught species quotas. The potential economic, social and ecological impacts are evaluated using data envelopment analysis (DEA). The results suggest that the use of proxy target reference points can result in short-term economic benefits at the cost of slower stock recovery and higher discarding.

During October-November 2018, four dolphinfish (94-102 cm fork length) were captured by set-nets and PSAT tagged. Tagged dolphinfish retained PSATs for 5-31 days-at-liberty (total 69 days) and linear dispersion from deployment to pop-up locations ranged from 63 to 204 km. According to most probable tracks, tagged fish made primarily northward movements. Tagged fish reached depths of similar to 94 m and experienced ambient temperatures from 17.8 to 23 degrees C. Movements appeared to be limited by a 3 degrees C change relative to sea surface temperature (SST) and were confined to the mixed-layer. Diel diving patterns indicated dolphinfish spent >80% of daytime activity and 40% of nighttime activity near the surface, where variability in diving patterns was more pronounced. The vertical diving patterns showed pronounced changes during dawn and dusk, where dolphinfish mirrored the movements of diel migrating prey organisms.

Living microbial mats and fossil microbialites associated with older paleoshorelines have been studied in the continental Maquinchao Basin in southernmost South America. Here, we investigate carbonate crusts from a former pond where active mineralizing microbial mats have been previously studied. Petrographic observations revealed the presence of abundant erect and nonerect microfilaments and molds with diameters varying from 6 to 8 micrometers. Additionally, smaller pores and organic matter (OM) remains have been identified in areas containing less filaments and being dominated by carbonate. A Mg, Al and Si-rich phase has also been identified in the carbonate matrix associated with the dominant micritic calcite. Moreover, mineralized sheaths contain mixed carbonate (calcite) with Mg, Al and Si, where the latter elements are associated with authigenic clays. The presence of mineralized sheaths further attests to biologically induced processes during the uptake of CO(2)by photosynthetic microorganisms. Additionally, the high density of the micritic phase supports the subsequent mineralization by nonphotosynthetic microorganisms and/or physicochemical processes, such as evaporation. Since the micritic filament microstructure of these recent crusts is very similar to that observed in fossil microbialites, they can be used to bridge the gap between living mats and fossil buildups.",,,,,"Ariztegui, Daniel/0000-0001-7775-5127",,,,,,,,,,,,,2075-163X,,,,JUL,2020,10,7,,,,,,,605,10.3390/min10070605,,,,,,,WOS:000554243900001,,,,,,

Based on unpublished stories essentially originating from New Caledonia, we show how strong the links are between myths and the physical environment in which Kanak live. As prevalent mythical animals, sharks can indifferently play the role of avengers and righters of wrongs, or vehicles for the spirits of living or dead people. They can be either allies or enemies in wars, and their role as potential man-killers is never overlooked. However, when humans are attacked and killed by a shark, it is always for a material reason: the victim broke a rule or a tabu, the shark was an enemy, the sharks withdrew protection, the event allowed a pregnant woman to reach a new territory, etc. Beyond arbitrary metaphysical justifications, such perceptions reflect respect for social and natural order. For Kanak ni-Vanuatu and other Pacific Islander peoples, sharks are part of a coherent Nature that includes natural and social hazards. In the quest for sustainable development of the planet, more in harmony with Nature, so-called 'developed societies' might draw inspiration from such perceptions.

Providing a suitable assessment of marine litter effects on marine life through bioindicator species is crucial to drive an effective waste management policy. However, to date no standardized tool has been developed to describe and monitor the impact of marine macro-litter on marine life within deep-water habitats. Modifying the protocol proposed to monitor macro-litter ingestion by the loggerhead sea turtle Caretta caretta, we perform a preliminary investigation on the suitability of different elasmobranch species for monitoring macro-litter ingestion in deep-sea. A total of 122 specimens representing 7 elasmobranch species were collected and examined. External visual inspections documented no clear evidences of disease due to marine litter entanglement. A total of 7 ingested litter items were found in the stomach or in the esophagus of 6 specimens of 4 different species (frequency of occurrence = 4.9%), with a maximum number of 2 items per specimen. No litter items were found in the intestinal contents, as well as no evidence of gastrointestinal blockages due to litter items were detected. The low number of collected litter items suggests that the number of samples required is too large for a feasible monitoring program. Moreover, we observed that the anatomy of the intestinal spiral valve may represent an obstacle to the transit of macro-litter items, which could be spontaneously regurgitated as it happens in the selective elimination of undigested remains, such as bones and scales. Therefore, macro-litter retention time in the gastrointestinal tract of elasmobranchs could be brief and shorter than retention time of food. This may lead to an underestimation of macro-litter ingestion frequency by deep-water elasmobranchs.

Within this context we characterize the factors that influence chefs' behaviours regarding sustainable seafood. A total of 52 Peruvian top chefs were surveyed using the Knowledge, Attitudes and Practices Framework, complemented by a focus group with a subset of the surveyed population. Our results suggest that, regardless of their age or academic background, chefs are aware of the negative consequences that human activities have on the ocean and believe that restaurants have an obligation to become part of the solution by promoting the use of sustainable seafood. Nonetheless, three factors limit chefs' understanding of key concepts and prevent them from fully internalizing the environmental consequences of their actions in restaurants: (1) sustainability is a new topic for them, particularly for older chefs; (2) the fish species commonly used at restaurants are poorly regulated, and (3) chefs are risk averse to actions that could result in profit loss. Additionally, the structure of the seafood supply chain further limits chefs' capacity to act sustainably, even if they are aware of the need to change their behaviour.

Petechial haemorrhages, inflammation at the site of injection, vertical hanging from the water surface, swollen abdomen and anorexia were the common signs observed in challenged catfish fingerlings. The morbid catfish also exhibited typical signs of septicaemia with haemorrhages on ventral parts of the body and fin bases and congested vent prior to death. The mortality was observed 48 h post injection. The average percent morality was 42 % in fish exposed to 1.77x10(7) cells of E. tarda, whereas, only6.6 % mortality was observed in placebo control (catfish received 0.1 mL of 0.85 % sterile physiological saline) and no mortality in negative control group (catfish received no injection) over an observational period of 20 days. The kidney and liver of moribund fish demonstrated different necrobiotic changes. In kidney, cellular and cloudy swelling, degeneration of renal tubules, necrosis of glomerulus, dilation of Bowman's space, hypertrophy, fibrosis of renal tubules and increased melano-macrophage reaction were frequently observed. In liver, disorganized hepatocytes, blood congestion and nuclear pyknosis were evident. To ascertain the host response to E. tarda infection, mRNA levels of three different classes of innate immune components viz. cytokine interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta), acute phase protein transferrrin and complement C3 were assessed by quantitative real-time PCR. Significant up-regulation (P < 0.05) of IL-1 beta and C3 gene expression was observed in infected fish upto 15 days post infection (dpi) in liver, kidney, spleen and blood though the level of increase differed among organs and dpi. Significant up-regulation (P < 0.05) of transferrin gene expression was seen at 1 dpi in kidney, spleen and blood while no significant variation could be observed in liver.

An unusual property of progesterone is its high affinity for the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR), which regulates electrolyte transport in the kidney in humans and other terrestrial vertebrates. In humans, rats, alligators and frogs, progesterone antagonizes activation of the MR by aldosterone, the physiological mineralocorticoid in terrestrial vertebrates. In contrast, in elephant shark, ray-finned fishes and chickens, progesterone activates the MR. Interestingly, cartilaginous fishes and ray-finned fishes do not synthesize aldosterone, raising the question of which steroid(s) activate the MR in cartilaginous fishes and ray-finned fishes. The simpler synthesis of progesterone, compared to cortisol and other corticosteroids, makes progesterone a candidate physiological activator of the MR in elephant sharks and ray-finned fishes. Elephant shark and ray-finned fish MRs are expressed in diverse tissues, including heart, brain and lung, as well as, ovary and testis, two reproductive tissues that are targets for progesterone, which together suggests a multi-faceted physiological role for progesterone activation of the MR in elephant shark and ray-finned fish.

Customarily, this feature has been treated somewhat superficially in phylogenetic analyses, often as a single defining character of a chondrichthyan clade. TCC is actually a complex hard tissue with numerous distinctive attributes, but its use as a character complex for phylogenetic analysis has not yet been optimized. This study attempts to improve this situation by presenting new terminology for certain aspects of tesseral architecture, including single-monolayered, multiple-monolayered, polylayered and voussoir tesserae; new histological data, including thin sections of TCC in several Palaeozoic taxa, and new proposals for ways in which various characters and states (many of which are defined here for the first time) could be applied in future phylogenetic analyses of chondrichthyan fishes. It can be concluded that many, but not all, of the unique attributes of modern TCC evolved by the Early Devonian (ca. 400 before present (bp)). The globular calcified cartilage reported in Silurian sinacanthids and the so-called subtessellated perichondral biomineralization (with irregular and ill-defined geometries of a layer or layers of calcified cartilage blocks) of certain extinct acanthodians (e.g.,Climatius,Ischnacanthus,Cheiracanthus) could represent evolutionary precursors of TCC, which seems to characterize only part of the chondrichthyan total group. It is hypothesized that heavily biomineralized layer-cake TCC in certain Palaeozoic chondrichthyans perhaps served a dual physiological role, as a phosphate sink and in providing increased skeletal density in very large (>7 m) Devonian-Permian marine sharks such as ctenacanths and as an adaptation to calcium-deficient environments among Permo-Carboniferous non-marine sharks such as xenacanths. By contrast, the equivalent tissue in modern elasmobranchs probably serves only to reinforce regions of cartilage (mostly in the jaws) subjected to high loading. It is also noted that much of the variation observed in tesseral architecture (including localized remodelling), ultrastructure and histology in modern and extinct chondrichthyans is confined to the perichondrally facing cap zone (where Type-1 collagen matrix predominates in modern TCC), whereas the main body of the tessera (where Type-2 collagen matrix predominates) exhibits comparatively little evidence of remodelling and histological or structural variation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0022-1112,1095-8649,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1111/jfb.14376,,JUL 2020,,,,,WOS:000544519100001,32388865,,,,,

However, the IPOA-s is ambiguous about the steps and objectives, diminishing its value as a conservation tool. We reviewed NPOAs to identify approaches taken to determine whether seabird bycatch is problematic, how bycatch minimisation and population objectives are set, and if thresholds are specified for managing impacts. Our aim was to recommend measures for improving consistency and effectiveness in future NPOAs and other management frameworks for seabirds, with relevance for other threatened marine vertebrates including sharks, turtles, pinnipeds and cetaceans. Globally, 16 NPOAs have been published, but few effectively linked seabird bycatch risk, objectives and management. However, we identified the following best-practice elements that could improve NPOA design: (1) defining explicit risk criteria and methods to assess bycatch problems; (2) setting specific and measurable objectives for minimising bycatch and achieving desired population status; and (3) defining fishery-specific thresholds to trigger management action linked to the population objective. Consistent adoption of NPOA best practice, particularly in states that have not already developed an NPOA, would help to mitigate bycatch threats and ensure fisheries do not reduce the viability of seabird populations.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0006-3207,1873-2917,,,,JUL,2020,247,,,,,,,,UNSP 108592,10.1016/j.biocon.2020.108592,,,,,,,WOS:000540247600005,,,,,,

Further, the strength of association among allied male dolphins varies and the stability of alliances correlates with the rate that males consort with estrus females (and is thus a possible indicator of dominance). To examine the possibility that synchrony reflects alliance association strength and dominance relationships, we analyzed videotapes from focal follows of two groups of males that reflect the range of alliance size and the strength of association between individuals in the population. We examined two variables:leadershipduring synchronous behaviors, based on which animal in a synchronously surfacing pair surfaced first, and thedegree of synchrony, based on temporal differences in synchronous surfacing. We predicted that closer associates would exhibit a greater degree of synchrony and that one dolphin in a dyad would consistently lead. Contrary to our predictions, the degree of synchrony was inversely related to strength of association within alliances. This surprising result suggests that individuals with less secure bonds may strive more to achieve synchrony. We found no evidence of leadership during synchronous surfacing or between synchrony and other behavioral variables. Proximate mechanisms for synchronous behavior, such as entrainment and mutual motor imitation (the mirror game paradigm), may inhibit leadership in this context.

The scarcity of data also makes it difficult to interpret results obtained in developmental studies done in model organisms, such as zebrafish. To overcome these gaps, we provide descriptions of the configuration of all appendicular muscles of Amia, median fins of Polypterus, and the dorsal and anal fins of Lepisosteus and Chondrostei. The musculature of other species, including sharks and sturgeons, is also revised. We describe muscles that were previously overlooked, report sexual dimorphism in the muscles of the anal fin of Polypterus, and reveal muscle variations within Polypterus males. Species dissected for the present study thus represent all major non-sarcopterygian extant clades of gnathostomes, i.e. Chondrichthyes, Polypteriformes, Chondrostei, Lepisosteiformes, Amiiformes and Teleostei. Moreover, we compare our observations with the relatively few works that have provided information about muscles of at least some fins of these taxa in order to provide a broad discussion on - and detailed schemes showing - the major evolutionary patterns within the appendicular musculature of these fishes. Such discussion provides an opportunity for a more comprehensive understanding of appendicular evolution and fish evolution in particular and of gnathostome and morphological evolution in general.

However, a single unpaired cysteine remains in the highly flexible hinge region, contributing in the formation of an interchain disulfide bond. Two types of C1 domain were found, and the one lacking a short a-helix showed lower proportion. This finding suggests that short alpha-helices might be important to the stability of IgNAR.

While most studies focus on relatively gradual changes, extreme events may have lasting impacts on populations. Animals respond to major disturbances such as hurricanes by seeking shelter, migrating, or they may fail to respond appropriately. We assessed the effects of Hurricane Irma in 2017 on the behavior and survival of juvenile bull sharks (Carcharhinus leucas) within a nursery of the Florida coastal Everglades using long-term acoustic telemetry monitoring. Most of our tagged sharks (n = 14) attempted to leave the shallow waters of the Shark River Estuary before the hurricane strike, but individuals varied in the timing and success of their movements. Eight bull sharks left within hours or days before the hurricane, but three left more than a week in advance. Nine of 11 bull sharks (~ 82%) eventually returned to the array within weeks or months of the storm. Six of these returning individuals were detected in a different coastal array in nearshore waters ca. 80 km away from the mouth of the estuary during their absence. The remaining three bull sharks moved downstream relatively late (after the hurricane) and may have died. We used binomial generalized linear mixed models to estimate the probability of presence within the array as a function of several environmental variables. Departure from the array was predicted by declining barometric pressure, increasing rate of change in pressure, and potentially fluctuations in river stage. Juvenile bull sharks may weigh multiple environmental cues, perceived predation risk, their own physical size, and shifting prey resources when making decisions during and after hurricanes.",,,,,"Strickland, Bradley/0000-0001-6443-7672; Massie, Jordan/0000-0002-8255-7448; Heithaus, Michael/0000-0002-3219-1003; Kroetz, Andrea/0000-0002-9670-7478",,,,,,,,,,,,1559-2723,1559-2731,,,,JUL,2020,43,5,,,SI,,1144,1157,,10.1007/s12237-019-00600-7,,,,,,,WOS:000537511500017,,,,,,

Specifically, we gathered information on fishers' perceptions of megafauna in the Bay of Bengal to determine whether fishers view megafauna species as beneficial or harmful and/or under threat. Fieldwork was conducted at five sites from the three coastal districts of Bangladesh. Data were collected through individual interviews (n = 150), focus group discussions (n = 13) and key informant interviews (n = 20). Small-scale fishers interact with marine megafauna as bycatch or intentional harvest, although a small portion of fishers keep the bycatch for sale and consumption or use as ingredients in traditional medicine. Most fishers release marine megafauna back into the water because they are not interested in the catch, they want to obey rules protecting these species or because of social taboos. Fishers have different views on the positive and negative roles of marine megafauna. The perceived positive roles are as indicators of productive fishing grounds, sources of food and livelihoods, and maintenance of ecosystem balance. The perceived negative roles are damage to fishing gear, personal injury, bad omens and predation on target fish. Irrespective of their perceived roles, megafauna groups are vulnerable to the use of fishing gear, pollution, overfishing, bycatch, direct killing, environmental changes and lack of awareness. The present study also summarises the relevant national and international legal obligations relating to the protection of megafauna. The findings reflect a lack of a coherent legal and institutional framework to facilitate conservation of marine megafauna. The results of this study contribute to a better understanding of megafauna status in the northern Bay of Bengal that, in effect, will help define future efforts to enhance marine megafauna conservation in the context of achieving the UN Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 14 and blue growth.",,,,,"Shamsuzzaman, Dr. Md.

When the receptor was expressed alone, stimulation was only observed at [10(-6) M]. A comparable increase in sensitivity to stimulation by srDes-Ac-alpha MSH was also observed when the receptor was co-expressed with wsMRAP1. In addition, co-expression with wsMRAP1 significantly increased the trafficking of wsMC2R to the plasma membrane of CHO cells. Surprisingly, co-expression with wsMRAP2 also increased sensitivity to stimulation by ACTH(1-24) and srDes-Ac-alpha MSH, and increased trafficking of the receptor to the plasma membrane. These observations are in sharp contrast to the response of MC2R orthologs of bony vertebrates which have an obligate requirement for co-expression with MRAP1 for both trafficking to the plasma membrane and activation, and while co-expression with MRAP2 increases trafficking, it has minimal effects on activation. In addition, when comparing the activation features of wsMC2R with those of the elephant shark MC2R and red stingray MC2R orthologs, both similarities and differences are observed. The spectrum of features for cartilaginous fish MC2R orthologs will be discussed. A second objective of this study was to determine whether wsMC5R has features in common with wsMC2R in terms of ligand selectivity and interaction with wsMRAP paralogs. While wsMC5R can be activated by either srACTH(1-24) or srDes-Ac-alpha MSH, and co-expression with wsMRAP1 enhances this activation, wsMRAP1 had no effect on the trafficking of wsMC5R.

Thirty-two individuals were sampled off the coast of Rio de Janeiro, including 13 gravid females carrying 34 embryos. Muscle THg concentrations were higher in all sex classes compared to liver, gonads and brain. The last three, in turn, presented THg concentrations above toxic biota thresholds. Significant correlations were observed between muscle and brain and liver, indicating systemic Hg contamination and inter-organ transport and distribution. In addition, correlations observed between organs strongly support efficient Hg blood-brain barrier crossing and maternal transfer. Maternal THg transfer was observed, with embryo THg also above toxic thresholds for fish. THg levels in muscle and liver, as well as embryos, were higher compared to other Squalus species worldwide. Hg contamination off the coast of Rio de Janeiro is of significant concern and should be further assessed. Potential human consumption risks are noted, as muscle THg concentrations were above maximum permissible levels set by regulatory agencies. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Here we describe an extraordinarily diverse assemblage of dermal denticles from deposits of Austria, comprising 17 different morphotypes. Based on the functional types of the denticles and their morphological similarities with both extinct and extant representatives, we attempt an order-level taxonomic attribution of the morphotypes recovered. The herein recorded occurrences of Hexanchiformes, Squaliformes, Squatiniformes, Heterodontiformes, the family Protospinacidae (Squalomorphii incertae sedis), and probably Rajiformes or Chimaeriformes increase previous tooth-based taxic diversity estimates of Valanginian cartilaginous fishes from Austria from four to at least nine orders.

Etched sections and light microscope analysis were carried out using the most abundant morphotypes with the aim of exploring the histology of chondrichthyan dermal denticles. Our results confirm previous studies in reporting a single crystallite enameloid, but we also report for the first time the presence of bundled enameloid in dermal scales, a condition so far restricted to the tooth enameloid of some chondrichthyans.

The obtained data are further explored with regard to their value for inferences of mosasaurid predatory behaviour. SEM observations have shown that the Schmelzmuster consists of columnar enamel with an outer layer of parallel crystallites; transmitted light observations have further revealed the presence of mantle dentine cushioning between enamel and orthodentine, and electron microprobe analyses have demonstrated the unaltered enamel chemistry and heterogeneous diagenetic alteration of dentine. Columnar enamel allows minute movements without rupture under bending stress, and together with the presence of shock-absorbing mantle dentine and possibly elevated Fe contents in the enamel, which increase its hardness and enhance acid resistance, it is suggestive of a good ability of the teeth to withstand severe mechanical damage. Such properties of teeth indicate adaptation to shaking and tearing large and resisting prey. (C) 2020 The Authors.

However, the difficulties associated with conducting broad-scale surveys of oceanic environments restrict the evidence base available for applied management in pelagic waters. For example, the Oceanic Shoals Australian Marine Park (AMP) was established in 2012 in a part of Australia's continental shelf where unique topographic features are thought to support significant levels of biodiversity, yet where our understanding of ecological processes remains limited. We deployed mid-water baited remote underwater video systems (mid-water BRUVS) in the Oceanic Shoals AMP to provide the first non-extractive baseline assessment of pelagic wildlife communities in the area. We used these observations and high-resolution multibeam swaths of the seafloor to explore potential relationships between prominent geomorphological features and the (i) composition, (ii) richness, and (iii) relative abundance of pelagic communities. We documented 32 vertebrate species across three sampling areas, ranging from small baitfish to large sharks and rays, and estimated that up to nearly twice as many taxa may occur within the region as a whole. This highlights the Oceanic Shoals AMP as a reservoir of biodiversity comparable to other documented offshore oceanic hotspots. Our results also confirm the AMP as a possible distant foraging destination for IUCN red listed sea turtles, and a potential breeding and/or nursing ground for a number of charismatic cetaceans. Model outputs indicate that both species richness and abundance increase in proximity to raised geomorphic structures such as submerged banks and pinnacles, highlighting the influence of submarine topography on megafauna distribution.

We conducted interviews with 27 retired fishers from Mazara del Vallo harbor (SW Sicily) working in demersal fisheries, using a pre-defined questionnaire with a series of open and fixed questions related to the abundance of sharks and rays. The questionnaire included specific questions about the trends they perceived in catch or by-catch of cartilaginous fish abundance between the 1940s and 2000s compared to the present. Information was gathered for 18 species, including Carcharhinidae, mesopredatory demersal sharks (Squalidae, Hexanchidae, Centrophoridae, Oxynotidae, Triakidae, Scyliorhinidae, and Squatinidae) and batoids. Overall shark catches were perceived to have diminished since the early 1940s: about 95% of fishers reported the decline of commercially important species (e.g., Mustelus spp.) and indicated species that could have been depleted or locally extinct (e.g., Squatina spp., Sphyma lewini, Mustelus asterias, etc.). Our study shows that LEK of fishers can be beneficial for reconstructing long-term population trends of exploited species when traditional standard data on fisheries catch or species relative abundance from surveys is limited or only available for recent periods. The results obtained clearly indicate the rapid and alarming decline of elasmobranchs in the Strait of Sicily highlighting the need for urgent conservation measures to be adopted.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2296-7745,,,,JUN 30,2020,7,,,,,,,,508,10.3389/fmars.2020.00508,,,,,,,WOS:000548185100001,,,,,,

However, little is known about how certain strategies influence foraging success and efficiency. Due to the miniaturisation of animal tracking technologies, a single individual can be equipped with multiple data loggers to obtain multi-scale tracking information. With the addition of animal-borne video data loggers, it is possible to provide context-specific information for movement data obtained over the video recording periods. Through a combination of video data loggers, accelerometers, GPS and depth recorders, this study investigated the influence of habitat, sex and the presence of other predators on the foraging success and efficiency of the endangered African penguin, Spheniscus demersus, from two colonies in Algoa Bay, South Africa. Due to limitations in the battery life of video data loggers, a machine learning model was developed to detect prey captures across full foraging trips. The model was validated using prey capture signals detected in concurrently recording accelerometers and animal-borne cameras and was then applied to detect prey captures throughout the full foraging trip of each individual. Using GPS and bathymetry information to inform the position of dives, individuals were observed to perform both pelagic and benthic diving behaviour. Females were generally more successful on pelagic dives than males, suggesting a trade-off between manoeuvrability and physiological diving capacity. By contrast, males were more successful in benthic dives, at least for Bird Island (BI) birds, possibly due to their larger size compared to females, allowing them to exploit habitat deeper and for longer durations. Both males at BI and both sexes at St Croix (SC) exhibited similar benthic success rates. This may be due to the comparatively shallower seafloor around SC, which could increase the likelihood of females capturing prey on benthic dives. Observation of camera data indicated individuals regularly foraged with a range of other predators including penguins and other seabirds, predatory fish (sharks and tuna) and whales. The presence of other seabirds increased individual foraging success, while predatory fish reduced it, indicating competitive exclusion by larger heterospecifics. This study highlights novel benthic foraging strategies in African penguins and suggests that individuals could buffer the effects of changes to prey availability in response to climate change. Furthermore, although group foraging was prevalent in the present study, its influence on foraging success depends largely on the type of heterospecifics present.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2167-8359,,,,,JUN 30,2020,8,,,,,,,,e9380,10.7717/peerj.9380,,,,,,,WOS:000544121100003,32655991,,,,,

Because the FDA mean includes fishes of different species that have been collected internationally over the last four decades, there is reason to believe that the FDA mean value is not reflective of the fish harvested in the Spiny Dogfish fishery. To evaluate how closely Spiny Dogfish match the values in the FDA's generic shark category, we collected muscle samples from 102 commercially harvested Spiny Dogfish caught off Cape Cod, Massachusetts, during the 2018 fishing season. Among the fish we sampled, 100% had MeHg concentrations lower than the FDA mean for sharks and 77.5% had MeHg concentrations that the FDA considers safe for consumption at a frequency of once per week. The mean MeHg concentration in our samples was 0.378 mu g/g wet weight, less than half of the value for the generic shark category. Moreover, through a comparison with data from the 1970s, we documented a 30% decline in MeHg concentrations for select size categories of Spiny Dogfish captured off the coast of New England.

Analyzing 412 trips to sea by 8 seals and more than 25000 acoustic detections from 23 individual white sharks, we observed seasonally homogeneous movements in seal behavior during months with greater shark presence. During riskier months, seal behavior manifested in near-exclusive nocturnal foraging, reduced offshore ranging, and limited at-sea activity. On these nocturnal trips to sea, seals returning to haul outs tended to avoid daybreak and traversed during diel minima in shark activity. However, seals tended to depart haul outs at dusk when shark presence was maximal.

In bigeye thresher sharks, the subcutaneous position of the red, aerobic swimming muscles (RM) suggests that RM temperature mirrors ambient during dives (i.e., ectothermy). In swordfish, the RM is closer to the vertebrae and its associated with vascular counter-current heat exchangers that maintain RM temperature above ambient (i.e., RM endothermy). Here, we sought to determine how exposure to a wide range of ambient temperatures (8, 16, 24 degrees C) impacted peak power output and optimum cycle (i.e., tailbeat) frequency (0.25, 0.5, 1 Hz) in RM isolated from both species. Bigeye thresher shark RM did not produce substantial power at high cycle frequencies, even at high temperatures; but it did produce relatively high power at slow cycle frequencies regardless of temperature. Swordfish RM produced more power when operating at a combination of fast cycle frequencies and higher temperatures. This suggests that swordfish RM benefits considerably more from warming than bigeye thresher shark RM, while the RM of both species was able to produce power at cold temperatures and slow cycle frequencies. Despite different thermal strategies (i.e., ectothermy vs. RM endothermy), the ability of the RM to power sustained swimming during foraging-related search behaviors may contribute to the unique ability of these fishes to successfully exploit food resources in deep, cold water.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0920-1742,1573-5168,,,,OCT,2020,46,5,,,,,1833,1845,,10.1007/s10695-020-00831-7,,JUN 2020,,,,,WOS:000543270200002,32588156,,,,,

This shark displays hormonally controlled bioluminescence in which melatonin (MT) and prolactin (PRL) trigger light emission, while alpha -melanocyte-stimulating hormone (alpha -MSH) and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) play an inhibitory role. The extraocular encephalopsin (Es-Opn3) was also hypothesized to act as a luminescence regulator. The majority of these compounds (MT, alpha -MSH, ACTH, opsin) are members of the rapid physiological colour change that regulates the pigment motion within chromatophores in metazoans. Interestingly, the lanternshark photophore comprises a specific iris-like structure (ILS), partially composed of melanophore-like cells, serving as a photophore shutter. Here, we investigated the role of (i) Es-Opn3 and (ii) actors involved in both MT and alpha -MSH/ACTH pathways on the shark bioluminescence and ILS cell pigment motions. Our results reveal the implication of Es-Opn3, MT, inositol triphosphate (IP3), intracellular calcium, calcium-dependent calmodulin and dynein in the ILS cell pigment aggregation. Conversely, our results highlighted the implication of the alpha -MSH/ACTH pathway, involving kinesin, in the dispersion of the ILS cell pigment. The lanternshark luminescence then appears to be controlled by the balanced bidirectional motion of ILS cell pigments within the photophore.

Because of the proximity to the port of Djibouti that is located along one of the busiest shipping areas in the world, whale sharks are potentially exposed to relatively high levels of trace elements and organochlorines. To assess their contamination status, concentrations of 15 trace elements, DDTs and PCBswere concurrently assessed for the first time in skin biopsies of 20 whale sharks. Additionally, 12 zooplankton samples were collected and analyzed for trace elements content. Concentration of As, Cu, Zn and Se were higher than in previous studies on this species. Whale shark samples exceeded themaximumallowable limits for foodstuffs for Cr, Pb Se, Cd and Zn. Results fromthis study suggests that Cr, Ni andMomay biomagnify in this species. With regard to PCBs, the predominant congenerwere Tetra-CB, accounting for 41% of total PCBs and Penta-CB for 23%, while for DDTs, the predominant metabolite was DDE contributing for 51% of total compounds. The maximum residue limit for DDTs and for the ind-PCBs in fish set by U.S. EPA and by the EU regulation, respectively, was exceeded in 62% of whale sharks. Moreover, the p,p'DDE/SDDT ratios were higher than the critical value of 0.6, indicating possible recent inputs of technicalDDTs in the area. This study suggests someconcerns for the contamination status ofwhale sharks in Djibouti and, sincemajor threats for this species include bycatch and illegal fisheries, highlights some level of risk from the exposure to elemental- and organic-contaminant via shark consumption.

Slow growth and low fecundity make many species vulnerable to overfishing, but increased demand for gill rakers in traditional Chinese medicine and elasmobranch meat means exploitation continues. In response, protection has increased, with manta and devilrays (Mobulidae) and sawfishes (Pristidae) now listed on Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES). This protection requires an accurate assay for species identification, even when parts of the body have been removed or products have been processed. Therefore, we developed and tested a new COI minibarcode to identify ray species among processed samples. This assay was tested on 25 samples from across four batoid orders and showed consistent amplification. In 68% of cases, a correct top match was identified on GenBank and BOLD, but its accuracy should be much higher (particularly due to extensive taxonomic revisions in this group). Bioinformatic analysis of existing sequences also showed 81% of minibarcodes were matched back to a single species and 100% correctly back to all other taxonomic ranks. This increased to 91% when only including records published in the previous 2 years (that should help to account for recent taxonomic revisions). Analysis of skate 'wings' and cooked samples was highly successful, allowing the unambiguous identification of species. These results suggest this minibarcode will be highly useful in identifying ray species and could have a range of applications from the analysis of processed products to investigations of environmental DNA, making them an effective tool in the conservation of endangered batoids.",,,,"Wosiacki, Wolmar/I-1724-2012; Gubili, Chrysoula/AAY-7167-2020; Batista, Romina/J-8282-2014","Wosiacki, Wolmar/0000-0002-4013-8501; Batista, Romina/0000-0002-7030-5227",,,,,,,,,,,,1877-7252,1877-7260,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1007/s12686-020-01158-4,,JUN 2020,,,,,WOS:000541213600001,,,,,,

For example, shark T cells associate alpha (TCR-alpha) or delta (TCR-delta) constant (C) regions with Ig heavy chain (H) variable (V) segments or TCR-associated Ig-like V (TAILV) segments to form chimeric IgV-TCR, and combine TCR delta C with both Ig-like and TCR-like V segments to form the doubly rearranging NAR-TCR. Activation-induced (cytidine) deaminase-catalyzed somatic hypermutation (SHM), typically used for B-cell affinity maturation, also is used by TCR-alpha during selection in the shark thymus presumably to salvage failing receptors. Here, we found that the use of SHM by nurse shark TCR varies depending on the particular V segment or C region used. First, SHM significantly alters alpha/delta V (TCR alpha delta V) segments using TCR alpha C but not delta C. Second, mutation to IgHV segments associated with TCR delta C was reduced compared to mutation to TCR alpha delta V associated with TCR alpha C. Mutation was present but limited in V segments of all other TCR chains including NAR-TCR. Unexpectedly, we found preferential rearrangement of the noncanonical IgHV-TCR delta C over canonical TCR alpha delta V-TCR delta C receptors.

Its distinctive features include the suboccipital muscles, described for the first time, the absence of the palatoquadrate symphysis, a longitudinally extended mouth, and teeth unsuited for dissecting prey in typical method of modern sharks, which is cutting motions powered by head shaking from side to side. The palatoquadrate cartilages ofH. perloand closely related Hexanchidae articulate with theneurocraniumvia orbital and postorbital articulations, which together allow for lateral expansion of the jaws, but restrict retraction and protraction. We interpret these features as an adaptation to a different method of prey dissection, that is, ripping in a backward pull. It employs the specific postorbital articulation together with the suboccipital muscles as force-transmitting devices, and is powered by swimming muscles which produce a rearward thrust of the tail. During this type of dissection, the anterior part of the vertebral column should experience a tensile stress which explains the replacement of rigid vertebral bodies by a collagenous sheath around the notochord inH. perlo. The backward-ripping dissection could have been common among ancient Elasmobranchii based on the similarly developed postorbital articulation, a longitudinally extended mouth, and the absence of the palatoquadrate symphysis. A biomechanical comparison with the extinctPucapampellaindicates that ancient elasmobranchs could be also specialized in the backward-ripping prey dissection, but their mechanism was different from that inferred forH. perlo. We suggest that in the early evolution of sharks this mechanism was replaced by head-shaking dissection and then later was restored inH. perloon a new morphological basis. A new position of the postorbital articulation below the vertebral axis is fraught with the braincase elevation when backward ripping the prey, and as a counter-mean, requires formation of suboccipital portions of the axial musculature unknown in other sharks.

Presence of denser water on the inner continental shelf results in a cross-shelf density gradient that drives a gravitational circulation with offshore transport of denser water along the sea bed that is defined as Dense Shelf Water Cascade (DSWC). Analysis of field data, collected from multiple ocean glider data missions around Australia, confirmed that under a range of wind and tidal conditions, DSWC was a regular occurrence during autumn and winter months over a coastline spanning>10,000km. It is shown that even in the presence of relatively high wind- and tidal-induced vertical mixing, DSWCs were present due to the strength of the cross-shelf density gradient. The occurrence of DSWC around Australia is unique with continental scale forcing through air-sea fluxes that overcome local wind and tidal forcing.

It also exhibits features not shared by any modern or fossil Squatina species or the extinct Late Jurassic squatinid Pseudorhina. A new genus and species is erected, despite there being some uncertainty regarding potential synonymy with existing nominal species previously founded on isolated fossil teeth (curiously, no squatinid teeth have been documented from the HSPS). A preliminary phylogenetic analysis suggests that the new genus falls on the squatinid stem, phylogenetically closer to Squatina than Pseudorhina. The craniovertebral articulation in the new genus exhibits features considered convergent with modern batomorphs (skates and rays), including absence of contact between the posterior basicranium and first vertebral centrum, and a notochordal canal which fails to reach the parachordal basicranium. Supporting evidence that similarities in the craniovertebral articulation of squatinoids and batomorphs are convergent rather than synapomorphic (as hypnosqualeans) is presented by an undescribed Early Jurassic batomorph, in which an occipital hemicentrum articulates with the first vertebral centrum as in all modem sharklike (selachimorph) elasmobranchs. The fossil suggests instead that the batomorph synarcual evolved by fusion of the anterior basiventral and basidorsal cartilages prior to the reduction of the anterior centra and loss of the occipital hemicentrum, not afterward as predicted by the hypnosqualean hypothesis.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0003-0082,1937-352X,,,,JUN 16,2020,,3954,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000541891600001,,,,,,

In ram feeding piscivores, a pattern of monognathic heterodonty has been observed where tooth size either increases posteriorly (Scomberomorus maculatus), or anteriorly (Carcharhinus limbatus), with exceptions such asTrichiurus lepturusandSphyraena barracudawhich have large anterior fangs. Tooth size and placement, as related to prey capture, was examined in Atlantic Spanish Mackerel (S. maculatus), Great Barracuda (S. barracuda), Atlantic Cutlassfish (T. lepturus), and the Blacktip shark (C. limbatus) by quantifying tooth occlusion along the jaw. Percent gape at occlusion inS. maculatusdecreased anteriorly in a linear fashion, indicating occlusion from posterior to anterior. Therefore, prey initially contact the posterior teeth with high puncture pressure during high velocity strikes, capitalizing the region of greatest bite force. ForS. barracudaandT. lepturus, posterior teeth and premaxillary fangs occlude at similar percent gapes (within 10%). The premaxillary fangs are likely used for initial capture due to the high angular velocity of the anterior section of the jaw and then for cutting, due to their laterally compressed shape. InC. limbatusall teeth occluded within a narrow range of 1.4-8.8% gape, indicating that all teeth meet at almost complete jaw closure. Simultaneous puncture of teeth prevents prey escape while maximizing the cutting area during head shaking.

The skin of Chondrichthyes fishes is covered in dermal denticles, whereas Osteichthyes fishes are covered in scales and are mucous rich. The divergence time among these two fish groups is hypothesized to result in predictable variation among symbionts. Here, using shotgun metagenomics, we test if patterns of diversity in the skin surface microbiome across the two fish clades match predictions made by phylosymbiosis theory. We hypothesize (1) the skin microbiome will be host and clade-specific, (2) evolutionary difference in elasmobranch and teleost will correspond with a concomitant increase in host-microbiome dissimilarity, and (3) the skin structure of the two groups will affect the taxonomic and functional composition of the microbiomes. Results We show that the taxonomic and functional composition of the microbiomes is host-specific. Teleost fish had lower average microbiome within clade similarity compared to among clade comparison, but their composition is not different among clade in a null based model. Elasmobranch's average similarity within clade was not different than across clade and not different in a null based model of comparison. In the comparison of host distance with microbiome distance, we found that the taxonomic composition of the microbiome was related to host distance for the elasmobranchs, but not the teleost fishes. In comparison, the gene function composition was not related to the host-organism distance for elasmobranchs but was negatively correlated with host distance for teleost fishes. Conclusion Our results show the patterns of phylosymbiosis are not consistent across both fish clades, with the elasmobranchs showing phylosymbiosis, while the teleost fish are not. The discrepancy may be linked to alternative processes underpinning microbiome assemblage, including possible historical host-microbiome evolution of the elasmobranchs and convergent evolution in the teleost which filter specific microbial groups. Our comparison of the microbiomes among fishes represents an investigation into the microbial relationships of the oldest divergence of extant vertebrate hosts and reveals that microbial relationships are not consistent across evolutionary timescales.",,,,,"dinsdale, elizabeth/0000-0002-2177-203X; Edwards, Robert/0000-0001-8383-8949",,,,,,,,,,,,2049-2618,,,,,JUN 13,2020,8,1,,,,,,,93,10.1186/s40168-020-00840-x,,,,,,,WOS:000542238100002,32534596,,,,,

Implementation of local management initiatives within these hotspots is more achievable than developing effective conservation strategies that encompass their entire distributions. Such measures have the potential for disproportionate population-level benefits but rely on a detailed understanding of spatiotemporal habitat use. To that end, we examined the residency and small-scale habitat use of 51 whale sharks (Rhincodon typus) over 5 years at an aggregation site in Tanzania using passive acoustic telemetry. Whale sharks were highly resident within and across years, with a combined maximum residency index of 0.39. Although fewer sharks were detected from March to September, residency was high throughout the year. Ancillary photographic-identification data showed that individual residency persisted before and after tag attachment.

This difference in respiratory physiology raises the question: What are the implications of these differences in lifestyle for circadian rhythms? We investigated the diel activity patterns of 5 species of sharks, including 3 ram ventilating species: the school shark (Galeorhinus galeus), the spotted estuary smooth-hound (Mustelus lenticulatus), and the spiny dogfish (Squalus acanthias); and 2 buccal pumping species: the Port Jackson (Heterodontus portusjacksoni) and draughtsboard (Cephaloscyllium isabellum) sharks. We measured the amount, duration, and distance traveled while swimming over multiple days under a 12:12 light:dark light regime for all species and used modified light regimes for species with a clear diel rhythm in activity. We identified a surprising diversity of activity rhythms. The school shark and smooth-hound swam continuously; however, whereas the school shark swam at the same speed and covered the same distance during the day and night, the smooth-hound swam slower at night and traversed a shorter distance. A similar pattern was observed in the spiny dogfish, although this shark swam less overall. Both the Port Jackson and draughtsboard sharks showed a marked nocturnal preference for swimming. This pattern was muted and disrupted during constant light and constant dark regimes, although circadian organization of this pattern was maintained under certain conditions. The consequences of these patterns for other biological processes, such as sleep, remain unclear.

Many large MPAs are, however, impacted by illegal fishing activity conducted by unlicensed vessels. While enforcement of these reserves is often expensive, it would likely benefit from the integration of ecological data on the mobile animals they are designed to protect. Consequently, shark populations in some protected areas continue to decline, as they remain a prime target for illegal fishers. To understand shark movements and their vulnerability to illegal fishing, 3 years of acoustic tracking data, from 101 reef-associated sharks, were analysed as movement networks to explore the predictability of movement patterns and identify key movement corridors within the British Indian Ocean Territory (BIOT) MPA. We examined how space use and connectivity overlap with spatially explicit risk of illegal fishing, through data obtained from the management consultancy enforcing the MPA. Using individual-based models, the movement networks of two sympatric shark species were efficiently predicted with distance-decay functions (>95% movements accurately predicted). Model outliers were used to highlight the locations with unexpectedly high movement rates where MPA enforcement patrols might most efficiently mitigate predator removal. Activity space estimates and network metrics illustrate that silvertip sharks were more dynamic, less resident and link larger components of the MPA than grey reef sharks. However, we show that this behaviour potentially enhances their exposure to illegal fishing activity. Synthesis and applications. Marine protected area (MPA) enforcement strategies are often limited by resources. The British Indian Ocean Territory MPA, one of the world's largest 'no take' MPAs, has a single patrol vessel to enforce 640,000 km(2)of open ocean, atoll and reef ecosystems. We argue that to optimize the patrol vessel search strategy and thus enhance their protective capacity, ecological data on the space use and movements of desirable species, such as large-bodied reef predators, must be incorporated into management plans. Here, we use electronic tracking data to evaluate how shark movement dynamics influence species mortality trajectories in exploited reef ecosystems. In doing so we discuss how network analyses of such data might be applied for protected area enforcement.",,,,,"Carlisle, Aaron/0000-0003-0796-6564; Jacoby, David/0000-0003-2729-3811; Curnick, David/0000-0002-3093-1282; Ferretti, Francesco/0000-0001-9510-3552",,,,,,,,,,,,0021-8901,1365-2664,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1111/1365-2664.13654,,JUN 2020,,,,,WOS:000539474400001,,,,,,

With the increasing interest in global wildlife tourism and shark feeding operations, it is important to understand the capacities of these animals to form associations between human activities and food. We used an operant conditioning regime with a simple spatial cognitive task to investigate the effects of reinforcement frequency and reward magnitude on the learning performance and memory retention of Port Jackson sharks (Heterodontus portusjacksoni). Twenty-four Port Jackson sharks were assigned one of four treatments differing in reward magnitude and reinforcement frequency (large magnitude-high frequency; large magnitude-low frequency; small magnitude-high frequency; small magnitude-low frequency). The sharks were trained over a 21-day period to compare the number of days that it took to learn to pass an assigned door to feed. Sharks trained at a high reinforcement frequency demonstrated faster learning rates and a higher number of passes through the correct door at the end of the trials, while reward magnitude had limited effects on learning rate. This suggests that a reduction in reinforcement frequency during tourism-related feeding operations is likely to be more effective in reducing the risk of sharks making associations with food than limiting the amount of food provided.",,,,"; Brown, Culum/S-9826-2017","Huveneers, Charlie/0000-0001-8937-1358; Vila Pouca, Catarina/0000-0001-6956-5198; Brown, Culum/0000-0002-0210-1820",,,,,,,,,,,,1435-9448,1435-9456,,,,SEP,2020,23,5,,,,,939,949,,10.1007/s10071-020-01402-2,,JUN 2020,,,,,WOS:000539506200001,32524291,,,,,

Although Helicobacter spp. infections are known to cause gastric ulcers and gastritis in humans and ferrets, it is unknown if the sea otter bacterium, H. enhydrae sp. nov., causes similar gastric pathology. Determining whether Helicobacter detection is associated with sea otter gastric pathology is the first step toward using this information to expedite diagnosis and treatment. We investigated the proportion of Helicobacter infections in 46 necropsied southern sea otters via quantitative realtime polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) of the 16S rRNA gene. Helicobacter DNA was detected in fresh-frozen and formalin-fixed gastric body and pyloric tissues using Helicobacter genus-specific 16S rRNA primers. Data from gross necropsy and histopathology were analyzed for associations between Helicobacter detection via qPCR and presence/absence of gastric pathology. ETEST (R) gradient strips were utilized to investigate antimicrobial minimum inhibitory concentrations for H. enhydrae isolates. Helicobacter spp. were detected in the gastric tissue of 85% of sea otters in this study. Fresh-frozen samples were more commonly Helicobacter qPCR-positive than formalin-fixed tissue, indicating variable sensitivity of detection in relation to postnecropsy tissue processing methods. Diagnosis of gastric ulcers at necropsy was significantly associated with Helicobacter qPCR detection in gastric mucosa (P = 0.005), while age, sex, presence of melena, shark trauma, and protozoal infection were not associated (P > 0.1). Helicobacter enhydrae isolates were sensitive to clarithromycin and tetracycline in vitro at physiologically relevant concentrations.

We measured denticle morphology on the caudal fin of three mature and two embryo common thresher sharks (Alopias vulpinus), and we compared thresher tail denticles to those of eleven other shark species. Using surface profilometry, we quantified 3D-denticle patterning and texture along the tail of threshers (27 regions in adults, and 16 regions in embryos). We report that tails of thresher embryos have a membrane that covers the denticles and reduces surface roughness. In mature thresher tails, surfaces have an average roughness of 5.6 mu m which is smoother than some other pelagic shark species, but similar in roughness to blacktip, porbeagle, and bonnethead shark tails. There is no gradient down the tail in roughness for the middle or trailing edge regions and hence no correlation with kinematic amplitude or inferred magnitude of flow separation along the tail during locomotion. Along the length of the tail there is a leading-to-trailing-edge gradient with larger leading edge denticles that lack ridges (average roughness = 9.6 mu m), and smaller trailing edge denticles with 5 ridges (average roughness = 5.7 mu m).

Penguins are also targeted, but to what extent remains uncertain, with only two records to date: Amsterdam Island, South Indian Ocean, where they kill and feed on northern rockhopper penguins Eudyptes moseleyi; and Gough Island, the southernmost island in the Tristan da Cunha archipelago, South Atlantic Ocean, where they are suspected to be significant predators of northern rockhopper penguins based on an unprecedented number of penguin carcasses (> 100) found floating at sea in 2011. We report the first documented records of such predations from the northern islands in the Tristan archipelago. Over three austral summers (2015-2017), northern rockhopper penguins with severe injuries were frequently observed at Nightingale Island. The cause of the wounds was unknown, but seal or shark attacks seemed probable. In January 2019, the first confirmed sighting of a sub-Antarctic fur seal, predating a healthy northern rockhopper penguin at sea off Nightingale Island was recorded.

These characteristics may induce complex population genetic structure patterns, with resulting implications for the management of exploited populations. The scalloped hammerhead, Sphyrna lewini, is a cosmopolitan, migratory shark in tropical and warm temperate waters, inhabiting coastal bays during parturition and juvenile development, and the open ocean as adults. Here, we investigated the genetic connectivity and diversity of S. lewini in the western Atlantic using large sample coverage (N = 308), and data from whole mitochondrial control region (mtCR) sequences and ten nuclear microsatellite markers We detected significant population genetic structure with both mtCR and microsatellites markers (mtCR: phi(ST) = 0.60; p < 0.001; microsatellites: D-est 0.0794, p = 0.001, F-ST = 0.046, p < 0.05), and isolation by distance (mtCR r = 0.363, p = 0.009; microsatellites markers r = 0.638, p = 0.007). Migration and gene flow patterns were asymmetric and female reproductive philopatry is postulated to explain population subdivisions. The notable population differentiation at microsatellites markers indicates low-levels of male-mediated gene flow in the western Atlantic. The overall effective population size was estimated as 299 (215-412 CI), and there was no evidence of strong or recent bottleneck effects.

Nutrition plays a key mediatory role in species-environment interactions, yet descriptions of marine predators' diets are usually limited to the combinations of prey species consumed. Here we combined stomach contents analysis (n = 40), literature prey nutritional data and a multidimensional nutritional niche framework to establish the diet and niche breadths of white sharks (Carcharodon carcharias; mean +/- SD precaudal length = 187.9 +/- 46.4 cm, range = 123.8-369.0 cm) caught incidentally off New South Wales (NSW), Australia. Our nutritional framework also facilitated the incorporation of existing literature diet information for South African white sharks to further evaluate nutritional niches across populations and sizes. Although teleosts including pelagic eastern Australian salmon (Arripis trutta) were the predominant prey for juvenile white sharks in NSW, the diversity of benthic and reef-associated species and batoids suggests regular benthic foraging. Despite a small sample size (n = 18 and 19 males and females, respectively), there was evidence of increased batoid consumption by males relative to females, and a potential size-based increase in shark and mammal prey consumption, corroborating established ontogenetic increases in trophic level documented elsewhere for white sharks. Estimated nutritional intakes and niche breadths did not differ among sexes. Niche breadths were also similar between juvenile white sharks from Australia and South Africa. An increase in nutritional niche breadth with shark size was detected, associated with lipid consumption, which we suggest may relate to shifting nutritional goals linked with expanding migratory ranges.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2296-7745,,,,JUN 7,2020,7,,,,,,,,422,10.3389/fmars.2020.00422,,,,,,,WOS:000538399800001,,,,,,

In the present study, we used tag and recapture data to estimate growth rates and construct size at age models for lemon sharks at Los Rogues, Venezuela. Annual growth rates of lemon sharks were comparable to those in other nursery areas, but considerably higher than those reported for the well studied nursery at Bimini, Bahamas. Growth rate increased with age during the first 4 years of life for lemon sharks at Los Rogues, while they occupied the nursery area. Comparison of growth rates of lemon sharks among geographically separate nursery areas showed no obvious relationships between growth rate and latitude or temperature.

The Nauta method, developed in a novel Army think tank at the Walter Reed Army Medical Center, was the next major breakthrough before neuroscience emerged as a separate discipline. Dr. Walle Nauta's (1916-1994) method allowed for the first time the ability to trace interneuronal connections accurately to their termination. The think tank, created by Dr. David Rioch (1900-1985), provided a unique intellectual environment for interdisciplinary neuroscience research, the first of its kind. Rioch hired exceptional senior faculty and recruited outstanding young investigators who were drafted into the Army, typically after finishing their M.D.s or Ph.D.s, and were interested in brain research. Many of these young investigators went on to illustrious careers in neuroscience. I worked with Walle Nauta at a time when the technique was first being applied to nonmammalian vertebrate brains. Along with other Army draftees, I was encouraged to pursue my own research interests. This led me on a quest to understand interspecific variability of connections in relation to evolution and ontogeny of the brain. By 1980, I had found that the variability of all known connections could be explained by a theory to the effect that new structures such as the neocortex were not formed by one system invading another and mingling, as Clarence Luther Herrick (1858-1904) had proposed, but by selective proliferation and differentiation sometimes involving the select loss of connections to reduce cross-modality interference as in the case of the parcellation and differentiation of cortical areas. The resulting parcellation theory predicts that elements of a primordial neocortex existed from the beginning of vertebrate evolution and did not originate by an invasion of nonolfactory modalities into the olfactory lobe, as commonly believed before the introduction of the Nauta method. This theory would not have been created if it were not for the brilliant environment that was Walter Reed in the 1960s.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0964-704X,1744-5213,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1080/0964704X.2020.1763759,,JUN 2020,,,,,WOS:000543116600001,32511057,,,,,

In addition, this study aims to figure out students' difficulties and defects in bionics design to promote design education. Third-year undergraduate students, graduate students, and experts whose backgrounds are industrial design were invited to be participants in the study. Participants of each expertise level were divided into two groups and were given whole and segmented pictures of white sharks individually to design electric cars. Outcome-based validation was chosen to measure the effect of analogy. Multivariate ANOVA was used to evaluate the effect of expertise level and source domain completeness on the results. The findings showed that presenting designers with segmented pictures can increase the number of biological elements and details in the solution. However, there appeared to be no significant difference between the novelty of the work, whether the group received complete or segmented images. Novice designers were more innovative and preferred to use more biological elements during ideation than the experts, while the latter tended to use fewer elements of biology and generated solutions with a higher level of abstraction. For design education, the findings will give teachers advice on how to train and inspire their students in bionics design.

Movement behaviours, spatial distribution patterns and vertical habitat use of juvenile, sub-adult and adult white sharks ranging in size from 1.9 to 5.7 m total length were examined using 43 satellite tags deployed over 15 years. Pop-up satellite archival tags and satellite-linked radio tags collected 3663 days and > 109,900 km of tracking data over periods of up to 381 days. We demonstrated sex-based differences in movement and distribution patterns of male (21) and female (19) white sharks. Female dispersal was broader and extended further offshore than males, which largely remained in neritic and gulf habitats. Female white sharks experienced a narrower range of water temperatures (F = 9.0-19.0 degrees C; M = 10.4-24.8 degrees C). Despite these subtle differences, both sexes showed an affinity to the Neptune Island Group and the shelf slope canyons of the eastern Great Australian Bight, which are productive and oceanographically complex regions that support known prey of white sharks.

While most theoretical models assume interference abilities to be constant in an environment, few consider that the extent of interference can vary by habitat and change model predictions. Using baited underwater cameras, we show a consistent dominance status between two sympatric reef sharks at an uninhabited Pacific atoll. Blacktip reef shark (Carcharhinus melanopterus) and gray reef shark (Carcharhinus amblyrhyncos) relative abundance showed an inverse relationship to each other but the strength of this relationship varied by habitat. Reef shark relative abundance declined more rapidly in the presence of heterospecifics on forereef habitats as opposed to backreefs. In all habitats, gray reef sharks were more likely to bite bait cages than blacktips when both species were present, and appeared to be the dominant species. Intraspecific interactions were also apparent, with individual willingness to bite bait decreasing as the number of conspecifics increased. Gray reef sharks may exert differential control over blacktip foraging success in different habitats.

Dolphin behaviour was monitored both on days when tourist boats were present and on days when they were absent. In the presence of tourists the proportion of time that the dolphins spent resting was reduced by two-thirds, whereas the times spent milling, travelling, and showing avoidance behaviour all increased. Furthermore, upon using Markov chain modelling to investigate the effect of tourist presence on the transition probabilities between dolphin activity states, significant changes were found in 10 of the 25 possible behavioural transitions, including increased probabilities of transitioning from resting to milling or travelling, from milling to travelling or avoiding, and from travelling to avoiding. These findings raise concerns that despite the management measures in place, tourist activities affect the dolphins' behaviour to a greater extent than was previously apparent, with potential long-term negative effects on their energy budget.

The number of recorded individuals peaked in the early twentieth century and between 1945 and 1955, and declined rapidly in the 1960s, with the last recorded observation in 1973. The decline coincides with the introduction of engine-powered fisheries, whereas the full extirpation followed the increased use of diesel-powered beam-trawlers. The recorded observations of Angelsharks were most commonly from the summer season, in accordance with the prevailing notion of Angelsharks migrating to warmer waters in winter.

A critical factor in determining the lifetime and transport of INPs is their size; however very little size-resolved atmospheric INP concentration information exists. Here we present the development and application of a radio-controlled payload capable of collecting size-resolved aerosol from a tethered balloon for the primary purpose of offline INP analysis. This payload, known as the SHARK (Selective Height Aerosol Research Kit), consists of two complementary cascade impactors for aerosol size-segregation from 0.25 to 10 mu m, with an after-filter and top stage to collect particles below and above this range at flow rates of up to 100 L min(-1). The SHARK also contains an optical particle counter to quantify aerosol size distribution between 0.38 and 10 mu m, and a radiosonde for the measurement of temperature, pressure, GPS altitude, and relative humidity. This is all housed within a weatherproof box, can be run from batteries for up to 11 h, and has a total weight of 9 kg. The radio control and live data link with the radiosonde allow the user to start and stop sampling depending on meteorological conditions and height, which can, for example, allow the user to avoid sampling in very humid or cloudy air, even when the SHARK is out of sight. While the collected aerosol could, in principle, be studied with an array of analytical techniques, this study demonstrates that the collected aerosol can be analysed with an offline droplet freezing instrument to determine size-resolved INP concentrations, activated fractions, and active site densities, producing similar results to those obtained using a standard PM10 aerosol sampler when summed over the appropriate size range. Test data, where the SHARK was sampling near ground level or suspended from a tethered balloon at 20m altitude, are presented from four contrasting locations having very different size-resolved INP spectra: Hyytiala (southern Finland), Leeds (northern England), Longyearbyen (Svalbard), and Cardington (southern England).",,,,"Porter, Grace C.

Here, we describe 37 taxa from the lower Miocene of the Molasse Basin: 21 taxa could be identified at species level, whereas 15 taxa could only be assigned to genus and one taxon is left as order incertae sedis. The material was collected from deposits of the Auwiesholz Member of the Achen Formation (middle Burdigalian, middle Ottnangian age, ca. 17.8 Ma) exposed near Simssee, Upper Bavaria. This faunal assemblage is a mixture of shallow marine, near-coastal, pelagic and deep-water taxa. The fauna from Simssee displays different biogeographic dynamics at local and regional scales, possibly related to the intense climatic, oceanographic and tectonic events that occurred during the Eggenburgian-Ottnangian stages. The faunal relationships of the early Miocene chondrichthyan faunas from the Mediterranean Sea and Paratethys with others regions are established on the basis of qualitative (presence/absence) data. The beta diversity (Sorensen-Dice coefficient) of the Miocene Molasse elasmobranchs was used to characterize the taxonomic differentiation between localities and regions. According to our results, the fauna from Simssee shows close similarities with those from Switzerland, Austria, France and northern Germany. Faunal similarities and differences are mainly related to tectonic events and oceanographic variables (i.e. migration through seaway passages) or might represent collecting biases.",,,,"Pollerspock, Jurgen/K-5499-2015; Klug, Stefanie/T-2328-2018","Pollerspock, Jurgen/0000-0001-5558-0987; Villafana, Jaime/0000-0002-6441-9025; Rivadeneira, Marcelo/0000-0002-1681-416X; Kriwet, Jurgen/0000-0002-6439-8455; Klug, Stefanie/0000-0001-9437-7236",,,,,,,,,,,,0031-0220,1867-6812,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1007/s12542-020-00518-7,,JUN 2020,,,,,WOS:000537335000001,,,,,,

Predicted climate-change impacts threaten the stability of this setting and the balance of biogeomorphological processes that generate them. In this setting, long-term surficial CO2 sequestration occurs through the combination of biomineralisation, organomineralisation and lithification, which locks atmospheric CO2 into CaCO3 rocks and sediments. Biogeomorphological processes that control the distribution and effectiveness of these mechanisms including biostabilisation, bioconstruction, bioerosion and bioturbation have not been addressed in this setting to date. A three-dimensional biogemorphological mapping unit framework is defined at three locations in Hamelin Pool within the shallow-subtidal to supratidal zones based on historical and recent multiscale datasets. This framework is used to review the complex distribution of geomorphological and biogeomorphological processes. The distribution of lithification within a biogeomorphological process context is examined, and current geological analogue models of microbialite and coquina development are expanded to include biogeomorphological processes. The framework is used to understand the impacts of increased water elevation in response to intensification of the Leeuwin Current during the 2010-2012 Ningaloo Nino event. Potential climate change impacts are identified including reduced intertidal bioconstruction, and a shift from microbialitic structure generation to increased grain generation reducing stromatolite development.

Current therapies suppress HBV but viral rebound occurs on cessation of therapy; novel therapeutic strategies are urgently required. To develop a therapeutic HBV vaccine that can induce high magnitude T cells to all major HBV antigens, we have developed a novel HBV vaccine using chimpanzee adenovirus (ChAd) and modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA) viral vectors encoding multiple HBV antigens. ChAd vaccine alone generated very high magnitude HBV specific T cell responses to all HBV major antigens. The inclusion of a shark Invariant (SIi) chain genetic adjuvant significantly enhanced the magnitude of T-cells against HBV antigens. Compared to ChAd alone vaccination, ChAd-prime followed by MVA-boost vaccination further enhanced the magnitude and breadth of the vaccine induced T cell response. Intra-cellular cytokine staining study showed that HBV specific CD8+ and CD4+ T cells were polyfunctional, producing combinations of IFN gamma, TNF-alpha, and IL-2.

In this study, we analyzed the food web structure in the central and eastern tropical Pacific Ocean based on trophic relationships of 35 pelagic species collected by Chinese tuna longline observers from June to November in 2017. Topology indices (node degree, D; centrality indices,BCandCC; topological importance indices,TI1,TI3; keystone indices,K, K(t)andK(b)) and Key-Player algorithms (KPP-1, KPP-2) were used to select key species and construct a simplified food web combined with body size data. The Kendall rank correlation and hierarchical clustering analysis indicated that different topology indices resulted in consistent rankings of key species. Most key species were the same as those selected in other studies in the Pacific Ocean, such as Shortbill spearfish (Tetrapturus angustirostris), Swordfish (Xiphias gladius), Albacore tuna (Thunnus alalunga), cephalopods and scomber. The food web would be separated into many unconnected parts (F=0.632,F-D=0.795,R-D=0.957) after the removal of the five key species, indicating the key roles of these species in the food web structure and stability.

Here we show that the strategies employed by whale sharks to compensate for the increased drag of an open mouth are similar to ram feeders five orders of magnitude smaller and one order of magnitude larger. Presumed feeding constituted 20% of the total time budget of four sharks, with individual feeding bouts lasting up to 11 consecutive hours. Compared with normal, sub-surface swimming, three sharks increased their stroke rate and amplitude while surface feeding, while one shark that fed at depth did not demonstrate a greatly increased energetic cost. Additionally, based on time-depth budgets, we estimate that aerial surveys of shark populations should consider including a correction factor of 3 to account for the proportion of daylight hours that sharks are not visible at the surface.

The goal of this study was to investigate the stability of body temperature in large fish using data from field experiments. We measured the muscle temperatures of free-ranging whale sharks (Rhincodon typus), the largest extant fish globally, and investigated their ectothermic physiology and the stability of their body temperature. The muscle temperature changed substantially more slowly than the water temperature fluctuations associated with vertical movements, and the whole-body heat-transfer coefficients (HTCs) of whale sharks estimated using heat-budget models were lower than those of any other fish species measured to date. The heat-budget models also showed that internal heat production does not contribute to changes in muscle temperature. A comparative analysis showed that the HTC at cooling in various fish species including both ectothermic and endothermic species ranging from 10(-4) to 10(3) kg was proportional to body mass(-0.63). This allometry was present regardless of whether the fish were ectothermic or endothermic, and was an extension of the relationship observed in previous studies on small fish. Thus, large fish have the advantage of body temperature stability while moving in environments with large temperature variations. Our results suggest that the large body size of whale sharks aids in preventing a decrease in body temperature during deep excursions to more than 1000 m depths without high metabolic costs of producing heat.",,,,,"Nakamura, Itsumi/0000-0002-1386-7266",,,,,,,,,,,,0022-0949,1477-9145,,,,JUN,2020,223,11,,,,,,,jeb210286,10.1242/jeb.210286,,,,,,,WOS:000541848100004,32366688,,,,,

The constant imposed temperature gradient may be aligned with gravity in either the same or opposite direction. In the dimensionless parameter space, deformation becomes important at a smaller drop size ratio when the temperature gradient and gravity are aligned in the same direction, because the driving force is larger and induces dimple formation earlier. For the same reason, in a physical system of ethyl salicylate (ES) drops in an unbounded matrix of diethylene glycol (DEG), deformation becomes important for smaller drops when the driving forces have a parallel, rather than anti-parallel, arrangement. In developing the population dynamics for slightly deformable drops, a new, simplified expression for the collision efficiency for spherical drops in the absence of van der Waals forces is presented, which successfully separates the contributions of the two driving forces. Two collision-forbidden regions can occur for opposed driving forces leading to a shark-fin shaped collision efficiency curve for two slightly deformable drops. As shown in population dynamics, if the drop distribution is broad enough, it is possible for drops to jump the first collision-forbidden region.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0938-0108,1875-0494,,,,JUN,2020,32,3,,,,,399,413,,10.1007/s12217-019-09774-y,,,,,,,WOS:000541245900013,,,,,,

One of the observed species is Endangered (Glaucostegus cemiculus) and one is Vulnerable (Dasyatis pastinaca), whereas the others are classed as Least Concern (Torpedo torpedoandTorpedo marmorata), Data Deficient (Taeniurops grabatus), non-assessed within the Mediterranean (Dasyatis chrysonota), and Not Evaluated (Himantura uarnak).

The usual J-hook No. 2 with 10 degrees offset, which has been traditionally used by the fishery, was compared to the 18/0 non-offset circle hook in an alternating fashion along the main line. In total, 22 experimental longline sets were deployed through the shark fishing seasons of 2016 and 2017 to examine the effects of hook types on the catch composition, the catch rates, the hooking location, and the status at haulback. The catch composition differed significantly among hook types. Moreover, an overall increase in catch rates for the main species, the sandbar sharkCarcharhinus plumbeus, and the shortfin mako sharkIsurus oxyrinchus, was observed when using circle hooks. There was no size-selective effect of circle hooks for the common species. The circle hooks were not effective at reducing at-haulback mortality of sandbar shark. Conversely, shortfin mako and smooth-hound sharkMustelus mustelusshowed significantly lower relative mortality at haulback with circle hooks than with J-hooks. Furthermore, circle hooks were more frequently hooked externally than the J-hooks for the three shark species. Results demonstrated that the use of 18/0 non-offset circle hooks in the pelagic shark longline fishery can reduce mortality at haulback for some species without any benefit for the dominant species, the sandbar shark. Overall, it is difficult to promote the adoption of the use of circle hooks as a management measure in this specialized fishery. Management measures focusing on fishing effort controls, fishing closures in critical habitats, and size limits could have significant benefits for the conservation of shark species and may help to improve the sustainability of the shark fishery in the Gulf of Gabes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1052-7613,1099-0755,,,,JUN,2020,30,6,,,,,1172,1181,,10.1002/aqc.3315,,,,,,,WOS:000541152000011,,,,,,

Also referred to as niche specialization, such differences can be documented through direct or indirect observation of resource or habitat use. Here, we examined selective habitat use in alliance-forming male Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins, Tursiops aduncus, in Shark Bay, Western Australia. Using 6 years of sighting data (2001-2006), we calculated the home ranges of 17 male alliances (comprising 3-14 individuals each). We defined five habitat types in the study area and measured the proportion of each habitat type in the home range of each alliance. Habitat selectivity was examined using selection ratios of used and available habitat within alliance home ranges. Since home range is also a form of habitat selection, we also examined selection ratios of alliances within defined subareas within the study area. Subareas were the combined home ranges of subsets of alliances that were linked by general location, distinctive habitat features and seasonal movement patterns. During each sighting, the predominant group behaviour was recorded. We analysed data from all sightings (which included all behavioural types: resting, travelling, socializing and foraging), as well as a restricted set of foraging groups only. For all sightings, alliances were selective of habitat within each of three subareas (northern, central, southern), and 14 alliances were selective of habitat within their home range. For foraging sightings, alliances within all three subareas were selective with respect to foraging habitat, and seven alliances showed significant selection of foraging habitat within their respective home ranges. Some alliances with broadly overlapping ranges foraged in different habitats. Alliance-specific habitat use may be influenced by ecological and social factors. Our results raise the possibility that the considerable variation in alliance size within this population may be influenced by the distribution of food as well as the distribution of females.

Siliciclastic sediment is interpreted to have been delivered to the tidal flat by aeolian processes because of the narrow range in grain size and paucity of clay. Tidal influence is dominant as evidenced by reversing currents and desiccation on the tidal flat, and megaripples with reversing current indicators in offshore shoals. Intraclastic conglomerates were deposited in broad channels on the tidal flats during storm surges. Microbialite deposition is interpreted to be controlled by accommodation favouring amalgamated thin biostromes developed in the tidal flat vs. larger mounds with greater synoptic relief in the offshore, and current energy resulting in preferential elongation of offshore mounds in a NE-SW orientation. Intertidal mounds and biostromes grew in the presence of significant siliciclastic flux and trapped it within their structure, whereas offshore large buildups incorporated little siliciclastic component. Oolite and skeletal grainstone formed in tide agitated shoals associated with large subtidal microbial mounds. Storms extensively recycled and redistributed skeletal and oolitic sands from the offshore shoals across the shelf as thin sand sheets. Spatial mixing of siliciclastic and carbonate sediment occurred across the tidal flat and shelf. Low-frequency and intermediate-frequency stratigraphic cycles were driven by shifts in the shoreline and changes in rate of siliciclastic flux in response to relative sea-level fluctuation. Random facies stacking and the lack of metre-scale cyclicity are interpreted to reflect stratigraphic incompleteness and an episodic signal introduced by storms.",,,,,"Harris, Paul/0000-0002-6908-9088; Khanna, Pankaj/0000-0001-7165-3082",,,,,,,,,,,,2055-4877,,,,,JUN,2020,6,2,,,,,276,308,,10.1002/dep2.108,,,,,,,WOS:000538680800001,,,,,,

MATERIALS/METHODS: Low-density lipoprotein receptor knockout (LDLR-KO) mice were fed HCD with an oral administration of CS (50 and 100 mg/kg BW/day), SCS (100 and 200 mg/kg BW/day), or water, respectively, for ten weeks. RESULTS: The administration of CS or SCS reduced the levels of serum triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), and LDL cholesterol and elevated the levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, compared with those of the control group (P < 0.05). Furthermore, CS or SCS significantly attenuated inflammation by reducing the serum levels of interleukin (IL)-1 beta and hepatic protein expression levels of nuclear factor kappa B, inducible nitric oxide synthase, cyclooxygenase-2, and IL-1beta (P < 0.05). In particular, the serum level of tumor necrosis factor-alpha was reduced only in the 100 mg/kg BW/day of SCS-fed group, whereas the IL-6 level was reduced in the 100 and 200 mg/kg BW/day of SCS-fed groups (P < 0.05). In addition, lipid peroxidation and nitric oxide production were attenuated in the livers of the CS and SCS groups mediated by the upregulation of hepatic proteins of antioxidant enzymes, such as superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase ( P < 0.05).

Here, we tested whether maternal investment and ecological lifestyle are related to variation in brain size and organization across 100 chondrichthyans. We hypothesized that brain size and organization would vary with the level of maternal investment and habitat depth and complexity. We found that chondrichthyan brain organization varies along four main axes according to (1) absolute brain size, (2) relative diencephalon and mesencephalon size, (3) relative telencephalon and medulla size, and (4) relative cerebellum size. Increased maternal investment is associated with larger relative brain size, while ecological lifestyle is informative for variation between relative telencephalon and medulla size and relative cerebellum size after accounting for the independent effects of reproductive mode. Deepwater chondrichthyans generally provide low levels of yolk-only (lecithotrophic) maternal investment and have relatively small brains, predominantly composed of medulla (a major portion of the hindbrain), whereas matrotrophic chondrichthyans-which provide maternal provisioning beyond the initial yolk sac-found in coastal, reef, or shallow oceanic habitats have relatively large brains, predominantly composed of telencephalon (a major portion of the forebrain).

We found that swimming modes in sharks are highly correlated with body forms where Group A sharks are predominantly anguilliform swimmers and Group B sharks are represented by carangiform and thunniform swimmers. The majority of Group A sharks are found to be benthic whereas pelagic forms are relatively common among Group B sharks.

We first developed an explanatory cumulative link mixed model based on regionally data-sufficient species on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List of Threatened Species (TM) using maximum body size, median depth, and reproductive mode, then predicted the statuses of Data Deficient species. Species exclusive to the Mediterranean were 3.8 times more likely to be threatened than species exclusive to the Northeast Atlantic.

Other quartz grains in the same nodule that yielded ages of 16.9 +/- 2.5 ka indicate partial dissolution of the caliche by increased rainfall at the beginning of the last glacial-interglacial transition (Termination I) . The lake was invaded by marine waters and organisms during the Holocene sea-level highstand of +3 m around 5-6 ka b2k through paleo-connections with the Atlantic Ocean, becoming a paleo-lagoon. At that time coastal waters were warmer than today, as indicated by the presence of the tropical shark C. leucas.

A rich deep-sea shark community with high endemism occurs on the continental shelf. Yet, the deep-sea shark taxonomy is still under development and poorly documented. Here, a DNA barcoding technique was adopted using the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I (COI) and NADH2 genes of samples collected from Japan with additional samples from genetic databases to draft out a phylogenetic tree of the deep-sea shark genus Squalus (dogfishes). The morphological divergence of congeners was further examined. Bayesian and maximum-likelihood-based species-level phylogenetic analyses of mitochondrial COI, ND2 and combined sequences provided strong support for distinct clades corresponding to the parental species with substantial sequence divergence between parental species. The combined dataset of the COI and ND2 gene was most suitable for barcoding of Squalus dogfishes. A multivariate analysis of morphological traits was largely consistent with the genetic data showing small but discrete differences in phenotypic characteristics allowing to separate Squalus species.

To date, metrics of thermal stress within marine systems have focussed on coral communities, and less is known about measuring stress relevant to other primary producers, such as seagrasses. An extreme MHW occurred across the Western Australian coastline in the austral summer of 2010-2011, exposing marine communities to summer seawater temperatures 2-5 degrees C warmer than average. Using a combination of satellite imagery and in situ assessments, we provide detailed maps of seagrass coverage across the entire Shark Bay World Heritage Area (ca. 13,000 km(2)) before (2002 and 2010) and after the MHW (2014 and 2016). Our temporal analysis of these maps documents the single largest loss in dense seagrass extent globally (1,310 km(2)) following an acute disturbance. Total change in seagrass extent was spatially heterogeneous, with the most extensive declines occurring in the Western Gulf, Wooramel Bank and Faure Sill. Spatial variation in seagrass loss was best explained by a model that included an interaction between two heat stress metrics, the most substantial loss occurring when degree heating weeks (DHWm) was >= 10 and the number of days exposed to extreme sea surface temperature during the MHW (DaysOver) was >= 94.

This study represents the first report of 2 previously unregistered definitive hosts for O. wageneri, namely the Atlantic sharpnose shark Rhizoprionodon terraenovae and the southern stingray Hypanus americanus. In this work, partial sequences of the 28S (region D1-D2) ribosomal DNA were analyzed to include O. wageneri within an eutetrarhynchoid phylogenetic framework. All O. wageneri individuals (which included plerocerci and adults) were recovered as monophyletic and Oncomegas celatus was identified as the sister species of O. wageneri. Furthermore, population genetic analyses of O. wageneri from the southern GoM were carried out using DNA sequences of the mitochondria! cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (COI) gene, which reflected high genetic variation and a lack of genetic structure among the 9 oceanographic sampling sites.

Our study analyzes a multi-specific artisanal fishery (<10 TGR) operating from La Paloma port (Uruguay, South America) within the MPA of the Rocha Lagoon Protected Landscape (MPA-RLPL) through the temporal assessment (September 2005 to January 2010) of daily catch composition, fishing gear, and fish community dynamics. Seventeen vessels operated inside and outside the MPA-RLPL and they reached 202,773 kg of total catch within that MPA. This amount represents 9.1% of landings registered in La Paloma port during the study period (5 years). Following the seasonal dynamics of catch composition and fishing gears it was revealed a differential use of this coastal protected area by the artisanal fisheries and the fish community. Higher catches of Squatina guggenheim, Mustelus schmitti, Galeorhinus galeus, Urophycis brasiliensis, Paralichtys orbignyanus, and Cynoscion guatucupa occurred from spring-summer, whereas in fall-winter, the higher catches were composed of Micropogonias furnieri (adults and juveniles), Umbrina canosai, Pomatomus saltatrix, and Parona signata. A multiclass classification tree (CART) method confirmed the strong relationship between the catch composition, fishing gear, and time of fishing (month, season); this method successfully classified the dominant catches in 72% of the sets (error = 18%, n = 294). Squatina guggenheim (a threatened coastal shark), and Micropogonias furnieri (a overexploited bony fish) were the dominant catch in most fishing sets. At the present there are no specific measures to regulate fishery activities inside the MPA of the RLPL. Thus, our study results were used to propose an adaptive strategy to management small-scale fisheries within MPAs in balance with natural resources conservation.

These rocks have different textural characteristics related to depositional and diagenetic processes, which influence the pore system and consequently the permeability. Understanding how the different facies are distributed and their relationship with petrophysics is essential to preview the quality of a reservoir. In this study, we classify the shell beds of the Itapema Formation through taphonomic characteristics, applying the concept of taphofacies, where taphonomic patterns such as orientation of shells, degree of packing, fragmentation of shells, abrasion, rounding, and sorting (type of grains) are used to differentiate shell concentrations. Six taphofacies (Tf-1 to Tf-6) were described in a core interval of 12 m, which corresponds to the Itapema Formation. Taphofacies Tf-1 and Tf-2 are well-sorted and unsorted grainstones/ rudstones with parallel-oriented and densely packed shells with a braded valves. Taphofacies Tf-3 and Tf-4 are well-sorted and unsorted grainstones/rudstones with oblique oriented shells, generally well-preserved but often with high shell dissolution. Taphofacies Tf-5 and Tf-6 are well-sorted and unsorted grainstones/rudstones with randomly oriented shells and densely packed deposits. In general, all the well-sorted taphofacies are composed mainly of shells and their fragments, do not show mud matrix or even shell fragments smaller than 0.2 mm, the size of valves varies from 0.5 to 5 mm and shell fragments are the smallest components. The unsorted taphofacies contain grains smaller than 0.2 mm, most of them peloids, and very small shell fragments. Through the analysis of thin sections, x-ray tomography (CT), high resolution tomography (H-CT) and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) it was possible to quantify the porosity in the described taphofacies and classify them according to Choquette and Pray (1970) and Ahr (2008). In well-sorted taphofacies primary pores are preserved; the total porosity varies from 9% to 21% in thin sections, and mainly consists of interparticle, intraparticle, and moldic pores and vugs. The control of porosity varies from depositional to hybrid 1, according to Ahr (2008), and pores are generally connected. In unsorted taphofacies, preserved primary porosity is uncommon and most pores are moldic and vugs. The total porosity in this facies varies from 2 to 15%, although almost all values are between 10% and 15%. The control of porosity varies from hybrid 1 to diagenetic, based on Ahr (2008), and the connectivity varies. Despite these textural differences between well-sorted and unsorted taphofacies, in general, the porosity is good and varies between 10% and 25%. The permeability in well-sorted taphofacies varies from 0.3 to 8 D, the high values being associated with a connected porous system, whereas in unsorted taphofacies the permeability varies from 0.01 to 0.4 D due to the occurrence of isolated vugs and moldic pores. The well-sorted coquinas were interpreted as deposits influenced by storm-induced currents and waves where the energy was sufficient to winnow the finer grains and preserve the primary pores. The taphonomic characteristics indicate tempestites to shoreface deposits, whereas in unsorted taphofacies the energy was not sufficient to remove finer grains generally associated with distal tempestites and backshore deposits.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0264-8172,1873-4073,,,,JUN,2020,116,,,,,,,,UNSP 104317,10.1016/j.marpetgeo.2020.104317,,,,,,,WOS:000528600100005,,,,,,

In addition, these taxa are compared with other morphologically similar species, such as P. martini and P. marginalis. Micropalaeontological analyses suggest a Turonian age for the low-crowned P. mediterraneus. Based on articulated tooth sets of P. mediterraneus, the pavement-like dentitions of this durophagous taxon are reconstructed herein, revealing a marked dignathic heterodonty. Imbricated dentitions observed in articulated specimens of Ptychodus mediterraneus also suggest broad distributions of bite-induced load on tooth plates; the dental features of this low-crowned durophagous shark indicate a high specialization for grinding thick-shelled bivalves (e.g., inoceramids and rudists). Fragments of cranial mineralized cartilages (e.g., a 'V-shaped' jaw portion) of P. mediterraneus are consistent to those commonly occurring in fusiform sharks. Evidences of scavenging on Ptychodus recorded on cartilages and tooth-bioerosion are also reported herein. Moreover, a posterior-to-anterior tooth replacement is hypothesized for Ptychodus based on the abrasion patterns observed in articulated dental sets.

The productivity and susceptibility analysis (PSA) has been recommended for elasmobranchs as it is a data-poor assessment that uses the best available information of the species and their fisheries to determine their vulnerability. A historical characterisation was performed to define the most important periods for the shark fishery in Campeche, southern Gulf of Mexico, and a PSA was conducted to determine the vulnerability of the eleven most important commercial shark species in each three periods. The periods were defined as: local commercialisation (1940-1979), when all species had their lowest vulnerability values, and Carcharhinus leucas, Negraprion brevirostris, and Sphyrna mokarran were classified as highly vulnerable; developed industry (1980-1998) when there was an increase of the fishing pressure, and most small species changed from low to moderate vulnerability and the large coastal sharks scored their highest vulnerability values; and declining industry (1999-2018), when all species had lower vulnerability values than in the developed industry period. However, Carcharhinus brevipinna, Ginglymostoma cirratum, N. brevisrostris, C. leucas, and S. mokarran were still classified as highly vulnerable and could be suffering the accumulative effects of decades of fishing pressure.

However, despite demonstration of secondary stress responses in a number of elasmobranchs, our understanding of the endocrine control of these responses is lacking. This is largely due to the unusual structure of the dominant corticosteroid in elasmobranch fish, la-hydroxycorticosterone (1 alpha-OH-B). Here we describe plasma extraction and HPLC separation procedures that allowed for the measurement of 1 alpha-OH-B and corticosterone from plasma samples in the cannulated, conscious free-swimming Japanese banded houndshark, Triakis scyllium. While patterns of concentration in the plasma for 1 alpha-OH-B and corticosterone were found to be similar in all experiments conducted, circulating levels of 1 alpha-OH-B were consistently 100-fold greater than circulating levels of corticosterone. Immediately following cannulation surgery, circulating levels of 1 alpha-OH-B increased 7-fold compared to pre-surgery levels, while the levels were 11-fold higher than pre-stress levels 30 min post a repeated handling/air-exposure stress. A three week period of fasting resulted in a 22-fold increase in circulating levels of 1 alpha-OH-B in the banded houndshark. This is the first report of direct measurement of changes in circulating levels of the primary corticosteroid in elasmobranch fish, 1 alpha-OH-B, following exposure to a stressor such as handling/air-exposure.

There is a limited amount of published research directly related to HMS and OPPs. This may be due to the relatively recent offshore expansion of the industry and of studies. Most studies have focused on structure-associated species such as rockfishes and snappers. Within the U.S. exclusive economic zone, the most probable areas of interaction between HMS and OPPs occur in the Gulf of Mexico. This report focuses primarily upon this region, while noting that HMS roam the majority of the world's oceans and may interact with petroleum infrastructure in many other locations.

Here, we investigate the effects of temperature and hypoxia on the growth and survival of small-spotted catshark (Scyliorhinus canicula) embryos by incubating eggs in normoxia 15 degrees C, normoxia 20 degrees C, hypoxia 15 degrees C, or hypoxia 20 degrees C. Incubation under the elevated temperature increased the embryonic growth rate, yolk consumption rate and Fulton's condition factor at hatching, whilst decreasing the total length and body mass of newly hatched sharks. Under low oxygen conditions (50% air saturation) the survival rate ofS. caniculaembryos dropped significantly and the temperature-induced increase in Fulton's condition factor was reversed.

To investigate habitat preference and the influence of water quality on movement of bull sharks, we monitored 36 juveniles using an array of acoustic receivers in the Logan and Albert Rivers, Australia, for 30 months. Acoustic data were used to estimate mean daily distance upstream, and generalized additive models were used to determine the influence of flow, salinity, temperature, dissolved oxygen, turbidity, and chlorophyllaon movement. A model that included flow, salinity, dissolved oxygen, and chlorophyllaexplained 89% of the variance. Movement was tightly correlated to both flow and salinity with sharks moving downstream in response to increasing flow/declining salinity and upstream during low flow/increasing salinity. During periods of negligible flow and stable salinity, animals moved upstream and downstream in response to decreasing and increasing dissolved oxygen, respectively. Dissolved oxygen and temperature were strongly negatively correlated and interchangeable within the model. Despite fluctuations in environmental salinity (0-32 psu) and a strong declining gradient in salinity with increasing distance upstream, bull sharks remained within a narrow band of salinity (6-10 psu) throughout the tracking period. The results of this study indicate that habitat choice by juvenile bull sharks is a complex tradeoff between physiology, food availability, and predator avoidance, resulting in large differences between adjacent systems and more broadly across their range.",,,,,"Pillans, Richard/0000-0001-6234-8764; Patterson, Toby/0000-0002-7150-9205",,,,,,,,,,,,1559-2723,1559-2731,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1007/s12237-020-00755-8,,MAY 2020,,,,,WOS:000556454600001,,,,,,

We used 10 yr (2009-2018) of data from commercial fisheries and a bather protection program along the coast of New South Wales (NSW), southeastern Australia, to investigate (1) spatial and temporal patterns of occurrence in bull sharks and (2) environmental factors affecting bull shark occurrence along the coast of NSW. Predicted future distribution for this species was modelled for the forecast strengthening East Australian Current. Bull sharks were mostly harvested in small to larger estuaries, with average depth and rainfall responsible for contrasting patterns for each of the fisheries. There was an increase in the occurrence of bull sharks over the last decade, particularly among coastal setline fisheries, associated with seasonal availability of thermal gradients >22 degrees C and both westward and southward coastal currents stronger than 0.15 and 0.60 m s(-1), respectively, during the austral summer. Our model predicts a 3 mo increase in the availability of favourable water temperatures along the entire coast of NSW for bull sharks by 2030. This coast-line provides a uniquely favourable topography for range expansion in the face of a southerly shift of warmer waters, and habitat is unlikely to be a limiting factor for bull sharks in the future.

The Florida Big Bend is home to a diverse assemblage of fauna; and the ecosystem is regionally important through its support of robust fishing (recreational and commercial) and eco-tourism industries. Stable isotope analyses suggest assemblages of fishes in the Florida Big Bend are trophically diverse, with considerable isotopic overlap across many taxa. Patterns of trophic structure corroborated the results of similar studies of these and related taxa and in other seagrass ecosystems, and there appear to be multiple channels of primary production. Large elasmobranch fishes were most enriched in delta N-15 with values well above the teleost fishes sampled, while smaller and demersal elasmobranchs had delta N-15 signatures comparable to several species of predatory teleosts. Results of stable isotope analyses suggested high trophic redundancy and overlap in resource use among both teleost and elasmobranch fishes.

The apparent trend among apex predators for some evolving into feeding on small zooplankton is of interest for understanding the associated shifts in anatomy and behaviour, while the spatial and temporal distribution gives clues to an inherent relationship with ocean primary productivity and how past and future perturbations to these may impact on the different tiers of the food web. The evolution of large nektonic suspension feeders-'gentle giants'-occurred four times among chondrichthyan fishes (e.g. whale sharks, basking sharks and manta rays), as well as in baleen whales (mysticetes), the Mesozoic pachycormid fishes and at least twice in radiodontan stem group arthropods (Anomalocaridids) during the Cambrian explosion. The Late Devonian placoderm Titanichthys has tentatively been considered to have been a megaplanktivore, primarily due to its gigantic size and narrow, edentulous jaws while no suspension-feeding apparatus have ever been reported. Here, the potential for microphagy and other feeding behaviours in Titanichthys is assessed via a comparative study of jaw mechanics in Titanichthys and other placoderms with presumably differing feeding habits (macrophagy and durophagy). Finite-element models of the lower jaws of Titanichthys termieri in comparison to Dunkleosteus terrelli and Tafilalichthys lavocati reveal considerably less resistance to von Mises stress in this taxon. Comparisons with a selection of large-bodied extant taxa of similar ecological diversity reveal similar disparities in jaw stress resistance.

Despite the strong link between metabolism and temperature in ectotherms, there is a paucity of data regarding how the metabolic ecology of species affects growth and fitness under such circumstances. Here, we integrated data describing field metabolic rates and body condition of two sympatric species of ectotherms with divergent lifestyles, the benthic freshwater (or largetooth) sawfish (Pristis pristis) and the epipelagic bull shark (Carcharhinus leucas) occurring in the Fitzroy River, Western Australia, to test the implications of their differing metabolic ecologies for vulnerability to rising temperatures. Over a temperature range of 18-34 degrees C, sawfish had lower field metabolic rates (63-187 mg O-2 kg(-0.86) h(-1)) and lower temperature sensitivity of metabolic rates [activation energy (E-A) = 0.35 eV] than bull sharks (187-506 mg O-2 kg(-0.86) h(-1); E-A = 0.48 eV). Both species lost body mass throughout the dry season, although bull sharks significantly more (0.17% mass loss day(-1)) than sawfish (0.07% mass loss day(-1)). Subsequent bioenergetics modelling showed that under future climate change scenarios, both species would reach potentially lethal levels of mass loss during dry season periods before the end of the century. These results suggest that ectotherms with low metabolic rates may be better suited to extreme environmental conditions, and that even small increases in temperature due to climate change could have substantial impacts on the ability of ectotherms to grow and survive in harsh conditions, including high temperatures and energy-limiting circumstances.",,,,"Morgan, David L./H-9794-2019; Beatty, Stephen John/H-8702-2019","Morgan, David L./0000-0003-1948-1484; Beatty, Stephen John/0000-0003-2620-2826",,,,,,,,,,,,0029-8549,1432-1939,,,,JUN,2020,193,2,,,,,311,323,,10.1007/s00442-020-04669-x,,MAY 2020,,,,,WOS:000534463600001,32435843,,,,,

Here, we review the impacts of both direct and indirect human interactions on the reproductive biology of elasmobranchs. Within direct human influence, capture-induced stress from fisheries bycatch and poor coastal management practices leading to habitat destruction and pollution are among the most impactful on elasmobranch reproduction. Capture-induced stress has been shown to negatively influence offspring and reproductive capacity via capture-induced parturition as well as by disrupting the reproductive physiology of adults. Habitat degradation impacts essential ecosystems that are necessary for the development of young elasmobranchs. Pollutants such as heavy metals, legacy pesticides, and flame retardants have been traced through elasmobranch reproduction; however, the long-term effects of these exogenous chemicals are yet to be determined. Furthermore, within indirect human impacts, climate change-mediated influences (e.g., ocean warming and acidification) can impact development, physiological processes, and behavioral patterns necessary for essential tasks such as foraging, growth, reproduction, and ultimately survival. Here, we also present a case study, where data regarding temperature and incubation time from 28 egg-laying elasmobranch species were examined to show relevance of such data in predicting how suitable (e.g., via maximum threshold temperatures) habitats will be for skate and shark development in the coming century.

Therefore, its early ontogenetic developmental traits are important for understanding the evolution of its particular phenotype. Here, we established six stages for prenatal embryos and used linear measurements and geometric morphometrics to analyse changes in shape and size as well as their timing during different embryonic stages. Our results show a change in head shape and a relocation of the mouth opening at a late stage of development. We also detected a negative allometric growth of the head and especially the eye compared to the rest of the body and a sexual dimorphism in total body length, which differs from the known data for adults. A multivariate analysis of covariance shows a significant interaction of shape related to the logarithm of centroid size and developmental stage. Geometric morphometrics results indicate that the head shape changes as a covariate of body size while not accounting for differences between sexes. The growth pattern of stages 32 and 33 indicates a shift in head shape, thus highlighting the moment in development when the jaws start to elongate anteriorly to finally achieve the adult condition of terminal mouth opening rather than retaining the early embryonic subterminal position as is typical for sharks.

To date, most scientific publications on this topic have focused on the collisions between large vessels and large whales. However, our review found that at least 75 marine species are affected, including smaller whales, dolphins, porpoises, dugongs, manatees, whale sharks, sharks, seals, sea otters, sea turtles, penguins, and fish. Collision incidents with smaller species are scarce, likely as a result of reporting biases. Some of these biases can be addressed through the establishment of species-specific necropsy protocols to ensure reliable identification of collision-related injury, particularly blunt force trauma. In addition, creating a ship strike database for smaller species can assist in identifying the species most frequently involved in collisions, identifying high-risk areas, and determining species-specific relationships between vessel speed and lethal injury. The International Whaling Commission database on collisions with large whales provides a good example of this type of database and its potential uses. Prioritizing the establishment of a species-specific necropsy protocol and a database for smaller species as well as the identification of high-risk areas for species other than large whales, would be a valuable step toward the mitigation of collisions with smaller species.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2296-7745,,,,MAY 19,2020,7,,,,,,,,292,10.3389/fmars.2020.00292,,,,,,,WOS:000533860200001,,,,,,

The blacktip shark Carcharhinus limbatus is a popular recreational species targeted throughout the western, central and eastern Gulf of Mexico (Gulf) yet it is unclear what levels of physiological stress result from catch-release fishing practices with hook and line gear and if the stress levels result in post-release mortality. This study correlates physiological response to stress through blood chemistry analysis and examines post-release behaviour of adult blacktip sharks caught to determine post-release mortality rates. Release behaviour was determined by pop-up satellite archival transmitting (PSAT) tags that record temperature, depth and light level data. To quantify physiological stress levels, blood samples were collected from 52 blacktip sharks and a suite of metabolic and osmotic markers were measured. Thirty-six of those blacktip sharks were also outfitted with a PSAT tag yielding time-at-large from 3 to 180 days. Of the 36 tags, 22 (61%) provided sufficient data to confirm post-release fate and 11 (31%) were recovered providing high-resolution data. Tag data suggests a post-release morality rate of 22.7% (95% confidence interval 7.8-45.4%), with mortality occurring within minutes (immediate mortality) to over 12 h post-release (delayed mortality). Compared to survivors, immediate mortalities exhibited significantly higher lactate (median 2.8 mmol/L-survivor vs 5.9 mmol/(Limmediate mortality)) and significantly lower hematocrit (median 24.4% (survivor) vs 14% (immediate mortality)) levels, but no difference was detected between survivors and delayed mortalities. Higher mortality in the western (30%) compared to the central (20%) Gulf may be due to shark handling. All PSATs from mortalities (N = 5) were recovered, and archived data revealed evidence of tag ingestion by predators. Results suggest reduced fight time, decreased handling time and limited air exposure provide blacktip sharks the best survival chances after release by recreational anglers.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2051-1434,,,,,MAY 18,2020,8,,,,,,,,coaa041,10.1093/conphys/coaa041,,,,,,,WOS:000534361600001,32440352,,,,,

In this work, we investigated the lowermost Middle Triassic (Ladinian) carbonate deposits in the Catalan Basin to evaluate the potential environmental mechanisms and evolutionary constrains involved in the kilometre-scale predominance of microbialites and the low-diversity and high-density Planolites association in a low-latitude epicontinental setting. The studied sedimentary succession records the development from a low-gradient, homoclinal microbial-dominated carbonate ramp evolving towards a slightly inclined swell-dominated type. Sedimentological analysis suggests that facies heterogeneity was controlled by pulses of syn-rift tectonic activity, which compromised Peri-Tethyan basin connectivity, reducing palaeobathymetry gradients. Although the monospecific nature of the studied trace-fossil association may reflect the delayed recovery after the end-Permian mass extinction, this is inconsistent with widespread, relatively high-diversity ichnofaunas in carbonates elsewhere in the region. Since other Ladinian basins were characterized by the recurrence of microbial carbonates, low-diversity ichnoassemblages and limited skeletal production, we hypothesize that shallow and restricted carbonate ramp settings harboured limited ecological complexity and widespread opportunistic colonization of the sediment when compared to coeval open marine locations.",,,,,"Mercedes-Martin, Ramon/0000-0002-4410-1984",,,,,,,,,,,,0024-1164,1502-3931,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1111/let.12378,,MAY 2020,,,,,WOS:000533156500001,,,,,,

Regions of oceanographic heterogeneity (e.g. current interfaces, habitat transition zones, ecological gradients) are strong candidates for the presence of ecologically divergent natural selection, but their role in the radiation of elasmobranch species is yet to be tested. We used an integrative framework to assess the relative influence of oceanographic heterogeneity and geological history on the diversification of an elasmobranch genus. Location Gulf of California (GC) and Baja California Peninsula (BCP), Mexico. Taxon Shovelnose guitarfish (genus Pseudobatos). Methods We sampled 210 Pseudobatos specimens from four distinct but physically connected oceanographic regions within the GC and in the BCP. We used genetic (mtDNA sequences and AFLP genotypes) and environmental (six oceanographic variables) datasets to clarify phylogenetic relationships, demographic history and evolutionary divergence among populations, and to test for associations between ecologically driven selection and reproductive isolation. Results Phylogenetic and population genetic evidence exposed five distinct lineages of Pseudobatos in the region, including four cryptic lineages in the GC. Phylogeographic analyses indicate a recent history of ecologically driven diversification associated with the Gulf's young oceanographic environment and its four ecologically discrete regions. This hypothesis was supported by seascape genetics, ecological niche modelling and by tests of selection. Main conclusions We propose an adaptive radiation for the genus Pseudobatos linked with habitat heterogeneity of the GC. Our study likely represents the first assessment of an ecological radiation in the highly diverse elasmobranch group.

Depending on body size, thermal tolerance, and ability to avoid predators, horn sharks may need to balance tradeoffs when selecting a quality shelter. This study quantified vertical daytime distributions via dive surveys and shelter fidelity via acoustic telemetry during June - August 2016 and June - November 2017 in a temperate rocky reef (33 & x2da;26' N, -118 & x2da;29' W). Immature individuals (< 58 cm TL) were found refuging in shallower (< 10 m), warmer habitats consisting of smaller crevices and overhangs, whereas mature individuals (> 58 cm TL) were found in deeper (> 10 m), cooler habitats sheltering in larger caves and rock ledges. The sizes and relative abundances of sharks varied between land-associated and offshore-isolated reefs, indicating habitat type may be a likely driver of ontogenetic shifts in shelter behavior. No sharks returned to their shelters in 2016 coinciding with the period of El Nino conditions (increased temperature, shifts in community assemblage), yet shelter fidelity was 47% in 2017 under non-El Nino conditions.

Baited Remote Underwater Video Stations (BRUVS) are a useful tool in assessment of fish assemblages, but research on the optimal sampling period required to record common and rare elasmobranch species is limited. An appropriate 'soak time' (time elapsed between settlement of the BRUVS on the seabed and when it is hauled off the seabed) requires consideration, since longer soak times may be required to record species rare in occurrence, or sightings in areas of generally low elasmobranch abundance. We analysed 5352 BRUVS deployments with a range of soak times across 21 countries in the Coral Triangle and Pacific Ocean, to determine the optimal soak time required for sampling reef-associated elasmobranchs, considering species rarity, and community abundance at each site. Species were categorised into 4 'rarity' groups (very rare to common), by their relative occurrence in the dataset, defined simply by the proportion of BRUVS on which they occurred. Individual BRUVS were categorised into 3 'abundance' groups (low to high) by overall relative elasmobranch abundance, defined as total number of all elasmobranchs sighted per unit of sampling effort. The effects of BRUVS soak times, and levels of rarity and abundance groupings, on the time to first sighting (TFS) and time to maximum number of elasmobranchs observed (t(MaxN)) were examined. We found that TFS occurred earlier for species groups with high occurrence, and on BRUVS with high elasmobranch abundance, yet longer soak times were not essential to observe rarer species. Our models indicated an optimum of 95% of both sighting event types (TFS, t(MaxN)) was recorded within 63-77 minutes, and a soak time of 60 minutes recorded 78-94% of the elasmobranch sighting events recorded (78-94% of TFS events and 82-90% of t(MaxN) events), when species rarity and abundance on BRUVS was accounted for.

Rays are a prevalent mesopredator in tropical coral reef ecosystems that are preyed upon by top predators like sharks. Studies have suggested reduced predator abundances lead to increases in mesopredator abundance (mesopredator release). We examined the relationship between top predator abundances and the abundance and behaviour of 2 small benthic ray genera using baited remote underwater video systems (BRUVS) across 6 countries. Where predators were more abundant, 2 genera of small benthic rays were sighted less often, possibly because of lower abundances. Small ray behaviour was also significantly affected by predator abundance. Individuals of focal ray species visited BRUVS significantly fewer times at sites with higher predator abundances. Where predators were less abundant, rays spent significantly more time in the video frame, and were more likely to feed from bait bags. In addition to predator abundance, small ray presence was significantly influenced by reef relief and depth. Neotrygon spp. were more abundant on deeper, lower relief habitats, while Taeniura spp. were more prevalent in reef-associated shallow, high relief habitats. Overall, this study found that predator abundance had a significant effect on small benthic ray abundance and behaviour in the presence of BRUVS.

We sampled 4 localities in the western Indian Ocean representing different habitats: coral atolls, coastal reefs, and granitic islands.

Our analysis of 12 juveniles and 43 adults revealed wide variation in trophic niche breadth between sampling sites and an offshore to coastal gradient in carbon that drove niche distinctiveness between localities. We observed niche width patterns suggestive of ontogenetic changes in diet and habitat utilization and larger niche sizes at the oceanic island sites than the coastal site. Trophic position estimates ranged from 3.5-5, expanding the trophic range of C. ignobilis relative to previous studies using AA-CSIA and placing it at the equivalent trophic level as many predatory sharks.

Aim: To investigate the clinical manifestations of DMAc-induced symptoms and how to rescue the functional loss due to occupational exposure. Design: Clinical observations of 60 spandex factory workers with the exposure to DMAc from January, 2017-19. Methods: Chinese drugs (reduced glutathione, polyene phosphatidylcholine, glycyrrhizin compound, Hugan tablets and ornithine aspartate) were used to evaluate the therapeutic improvements in DMAc-exposed patients. Results: Our data found that 58.3% patients had no distinct clinical symptoms, but 41.7% patients felt fatigue, and 21.7% patients suffered abdominal discomfort and appetite loss, and 8.3% patients had yellow skin and sclera. The ultrasonic and CT imaging revealed that some patients have fatty livers, intrahepatic calcifications, hepatomegaly, gallbladder wall edema and abdominal effusions. Biochemical analysis showed that the alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (P<0.001), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (P<0.001), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (P<0.001) and bilirubin (P<0.01) statistically decreased after the drug treatment, but alkaline phosphatase (P>0.05) and glutamyl transpeptidase (P>0.05) did not decrease. Twenty-nine out of the thirty-one patients' abnormal blood ammonia recovered. The risk factor of ALT on hospitalization time was significantly related (P<0.01). Conclusions: The drugs above are sufficient to rescue functional loss in DMAc-induced toxic hepatitis, in part via the regulations of ALT, AST, LDH, bilirubin and ammonia.

Sampling was conducted during autumn 2017 in two nearshore (Palm Tree and Al-Besheriya Islands) and two offshore locations (Sherawoo and Ishat Islands). Fish muscle and liver tissues were analyzed according to the US Environmental Protection Agency Method 1630. The lowest mean MeHg concentration was found to be 42.3 ppb wet weight in the lower trophic level fish Gerres oyena due to small fish size and trophic level; whereas, the highest MeHg concentration was found in higher trophic level sharks Rhizoprionodon oligolinx and Chiloscyllium arabicum with mean wet weight concentrations of 712 ppb and 166 ppb, respectively. Linear relationships were found between fish body size (weight, length, age) and MeHg concentrations. MeHg bioaccumulation was found to be higher in liver than in muscle tissue; however, there was no significant difference in tissue MeHg accumulation as well as, the concentrations between the four locations. The present study concludes that MeHg in most of the fish tissues is within the allowable limits and pose no threat to public health. Only the higher trophic level shark Rhizoprionodon oligolinx was found to have a MeHg concentration higher than the US EPA advisory level of 0.3 ppm. However, consumers should still be encouraged to eat smaller sized younger fish from lower trophic levels, which would be safer than larger older species from higher trophic levels.

Among the criteria used to discriminate Deania species one is dermal denticle length and body colour. In this study the authors explore the feasibility of these criteria and examine other morphological characters to investigate if sexual or ontogenic features had relevance for the distinction of the species particularly those sampled in this study, D. calcea and D. profundorum. Molecular analyses were conducted to validate these results. In D. calcea, dermal denticle length ranged from 340 mu m to 1400 mu m (763.2 mu m +/- 180.4 s.d.); in D. profundorum, dermal denticle length ranged from 195 mu m to 650 mu m (372.3 mu m +/- 111.7 s.d.). In both Deania species, a significant positive correlation was found between shark total length and dermal denticle length. Dermal denticles varied in size and shape along the shark body. These differences were significant both intra- and inter-specifically. A multivariate analysis based on morphological characters was used to test differences between D. calcea and D. profundorum. The hierarchical analysis clearly identified three groups; two groups corresponded to each species, and a third group discriminated between small and large individuals of D. profundorum. The morphometric characters that contributed most to the divergence between both species were mainly related to the size of the dorsal fins, the inter-dorsal distance and the distances from the snout to the origin of each dorsal fin. Based on morphological characters, no sexual dimorphism was observed. The phylogenetic tree was reconstructed with molecular COI sequences available on BOLD and those obtained in this study. The output tree discriminate D. calcea from D. profundorum, however could not separate molecularly D. calcea and D. hystricosa. (c) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Data also provided insight into their habitat use and population structure. From October 2015 to October 2018, eight species, either endangered or data deficient according to the IUCN red list, were reported, including: the common eagle ray, Myliobatis aquila , the common stingray, Dasyatis pastinaca , the round stingray, Taeniurops grabatus , the spiny butterfly ray, Gymnura altavela , the bull ray, Aetomylaeus bovinus , the angel shark, Squatina squatina , the marbled electric ray, Torpedo marmorata and the hammerhead shark, Sphyrna zygaena. All species were predominantly observed at night. The species varied in their habitat use; D. pastinaca , G. altavela and S. squatina dominated in sandy and mixed bottoms, while M. aquila and T. grabatus were mostly found in rocky and mixed bottoms. Both D. pastinaca and T. grabatus did not show any seasonal pattern, with consistent records all year around. In contrast, M. aquila , G. altavela and S. squatina showed some degree of seasonality. For five species, small-sized individuals were observed.

Importantly, populations are most often concurrently exposed to a suite of pathogens, which is rarely investigated, because contact networks are typically inferred from spatial proximity only. Here, we use 5 years of detailed observations of Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins (Tursions aduncus) that distinguish between four different types of social contact. We investigate how demography (sex and age) affects these different social behaviors. Three of the four social behaviors can he used as a proxy for understanding key routes of direct pathogen transmission (sexual contact, skin contact, and aerosol contact of respiratory vapor above the water surface). We quantify the demography-dependent network connectedness, representing the risk of exposure associated with the three pathogen transmission routes, and quantify coexposure risks and relate them to individual sociability. Our results suggest demography-driven disease risk in bottlenose dolphins, with males at greater risk than females, and transmission route-dependent implications for different age classes. We hypothesize that male alliance formation and the divergent reproductive strategies in males and females drive the demography-dependent connectedness and, hence, exposure risk to pathogens. Our study provides evidence for the risk of coexposure to pathogens transmitted along different transmission routes and that they relate to individual sociability. Hence, our results highlight the importance of a multibehavioral approach for a more complete understanding of the overall pathogen transmission risk in animal populations, as well as the cumulative costs of sociality.",,,,,"Bansal, Shweta/0000-0002-1740-5421",,,,,,,,,,,,1045-2249,1465-7279,,,,MAY-JUN,2020,31,3,,,,,651,660,,10.1093/beheco/araa002,,,,,,,WOS:000544153300006,,,,,,

Surviving these challenging conditions requires global metabolic reorganization that is orchestrated, in part, by microRNAs that can rapidly and reversibly target all biological functions. Herein, we review the involvement of microRNAs in natural models of anoxia and hypoxia tolerance, with a focus on the involvement of oxygen-responsive microRNAs (OxymiRs) in coordinating the metabolic rate depression that allows animals to tolerate reduced oxygen levels. We begin by discussing animals that experience acute or chronic periods of oxygen deprivation at the ocean's oxygen minimum zone and go on to consider more elevated environments, up to mountain plateaus over 3500 m above sea level. We highlight the commonalities and differences between OxymiR responses of over 20 diverse animal species, including invertebrates and vertebrates. This is followed by a discussion of the OxymiR adaptations, and maladaptations, present in hypoxic high-altitude environments where animals, including humans, do not enter hypometabolic states in response to hypoxia. Comparing the OxymiR responses of evolutionarily disparate animals from diverse environments allows us to identify species-specific and convergent microRNA responses, such as miR-210 regulation. However, it also sheds light on the lack of a single unified response to oxygen limitation. Characterizing OxymiRs will help us to understand their protective roles and raises the question of whether they can be exploited to alleviate the pathogenesis of ischemic insults and boost recovery.

Investigation of the pressure, volume, temperature (PVT) relationships for liver oils of 10 species of deep-sea Chondrichthyes shows that the density difference between oil and seawater, Delta rho, remains almost constant with pressure down to full ocean depth (11 km, 1100 bar), theoretically providing buoyancy far beyond the maximum depth of occurrence (3700 m) of sharks. However, Delta rho does change significantly with temperature and we show that the combined effects of pressure and temperature can decrease buoyancy of oil by up to 10% between the surface and 3500 m depth across interfaces between warm southern and cold polar waters in the Rockall Trough in the NE Atlantic. This increases drag more than 10-fold compared with neutral buoyancy during horizontal slow swimming (0.1 m s(-1)), but the effect becomes negligible at high speeds. Chondrichthyes generally experience positive buoyancy change during ascent and negative buoyancy change during descent, but contrary effects can occur at interfaces between waters of different densities.

Entanglement of invertebrates, sharks, turtles, birds and marine mammals is mainly caused by macroplastics (>5 mm), and leads to reduced mobility, ineffective foraging and subsequent mortality. The main plastic types associated with entanglement are improperly discarded fishing nets, lines, ropes and straps. In South Africa and surrounding waters, plastic ingestion has been reported in a number of marine species: sharks (n=10), fish (n=7), turtles (n=1) and birds (n=36). Lethal (macroplastic) and sub-lethal effects (microplastic <= 5 mm) of marine debris on biota have been noted, but at the time of this review there were no published reports on impacts at the population level. Consumed shellfish are possible vectors for the introduction of microplastics into humans. The specific impacts of microplastic ingestion on human health are largely unknown, but additives associated with plastics represent a threat. The research infrastructure in South Africa is insufficient to monitor and characterise marine plastic debris and, in many cases, not in line with global standards. More research effort is needed to understand the impacts of marine plastic debris on humans and marine biota in South Africa, particularly at the population level. Significance Macroplastics affect marine biota mainly via entanglement and microplastics largely through ingestion. Macro- and microplastic interactions with biota can result in sub-lethal effects and mortality but no population effects have been reported for South Africa. Consumed shellfish are a potential source of microplastics for humans but their potential effects in humans remain unknown.

However, whether the composition of GSL mat communities covaries with microbialite morphology and lake environment is unknown. Moreover, the potential adaptations that allow the establishment of these extensive mat communities at high salinity (14% to 17% total salts) are poorly understood. To address these questions, microbial mats were sampled from seven locations in the south arm of GSL representing different lake environments and microbialite morphologies. Despite the morphological differences, microbialite-associated mats were taxonomically similar and were dominated by the cyanobacterium Euhalothece and several heterotrophic bacteria. Metagenomic sequencing of a representative mat revealed Euhalothece and subdominant Thiohalocapsa populations that harbor the Calvin cycle and nitrogenase, suggesting they supply fixed carbon and nitrogen to heterotrophic bacteria. Fifteen of the next sixteen most abundant taxa are inferred to be aerobic heterotrophs and, surprisingly, harbor reaction center, rhodopsin, and/or bacteriochlorophyll biosynthesis proteins, suggesting aerobic photoheterotrophic (APH) capabilities. Importantly, proteins involved in APH are enriched in the GSL community relative to that in microbialite mat communities from lower salinity environments. These findings indicate that the ability to integrate light into energy metabolism is a key adaptation allowing for robust mat development in the hypersaline GSL. IMPORTANCE The earliest evidence of life on Earth is from organosedimentary structures, termed microbialites, preserved in 3.481-billion-year-old (Ga) rocks. Phototrophic microbial mats form in association with an similar to 700-km(2) expanse of morphologically diverse microbialites in the hypersaline Great Salt Lake (GSL), Utah. Here, we show taxonomically similar microbial mat communities are associated with morphologically diverse microbialites across the lake. Metagenomic sequencing reveals an abundance and diversity of autotrophic and heterotrophic taxa capable of harvesting light energy to drive metabolism. The unexpected abundance of and diversity in the mechanisms of harvesting light energy observed in GSL mat populations likely function to minimize niche overlap among coinhabiting taxa, provide a mechanism(s) to increase energy yield and osmotic balance during salt stress, and enhance fitness. Together, these physiological benefits promote the formation of robust mats that, in turn, influence the formation of morphologically diverse microbialite structures that can be imprinted in the rock record.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0099-2240,1098-5336,,,,MAY,2020,86,10,,,,,,,e00165-20,10.1128/AEM.00165-20,,,,,,,WOS:000534070600005,32198176,,,,,

In this paper, three core arguments are being revisited that were uttered against a listing of the mako shark: that it is not scientifically justifiable; that it will cause implementation problems and will have limited conservation success; and that regional fisheries management organisations (RFMOs) are better suited to manage mako sharks. It is concluded that while the mako is not yet endangered globally, the precautionary approach justifies its listing.

Based on their trophic habits, sharks and batoids occupy higher and medium trophic levels in the food webs, although differences in the trophic preferences exist between species. They are important organisms in marine ecosystems by maintaining the species below them in the food chain and serving as an indicator for ocean health. In comparison to sharks, batoids usually receive less research attention, with very little diet information available. This is true of the speckled ray (Raja polystigma), one of the three endemic batoids in Mediterranean waters. Here, by combining analyses of stomach contents and stable isotopes, we examined the trophic ecology (dietary composition and trophic position) of this ray in the north-western Mediterranean Sea. We also compared its trophic niche with the trophic position of other sympatric elasmobranchs present in same marine ecosystem. The results revealed that R. polystigma mainly consumes shrimps and to a lesser extent crabs, fin-fish, cephalopods, polychaetes and, surprisingly, small demersal sharks.

During this process, cartilage cells (chondrocytes) mineralize the extracellular matrix and undergo apoptosis, giving way to bone cells (osteocytes). In contrast, sharks and rays (elasmobranchs) have cartilaginous skeletons throughout life, where only the surface mineralizes, forming a layer of tiles (tesserae). Elasmobranch chondrocytes, unlike those of other vertebrates, survive cartilage mineralization and are maintained alive in spaces (lacunae) within tesserae. However, the functions of the chondrocytes in the mineralized tissue remain unknown. Applying a custom analysis workflow to high-resolution synchrotron microCT scans of tesserae, we characterize the morphologies and arrangements of stingray chondrocyte lacunae, using lacunar morphology as a proxy for chondrocyte morphology. We show that the cell density is comparable in unmineralized and mineralized tissue and that cells maintain similar volume even when they have been incorporated into tesserae. Our findings support previous hypotheses that elasmobranch chondrocytes, unlike those of other taxa, do not proliferate, hypertrophy or undergo apoptosis during mineralization. Tessera lacunae show zonal variation in their shapes, being flatter further from and more spherical closer to the unmineralized cartilage matrix, and larger in the center of tesserae. The lacunae show pronounced organization into parallel layers and strong orientation toward neighboring tesserae. Tesserae also exhibit local variation in lacunar density, with the density considerably higher near pores passing through the tesseral layer, suggesting pores and cells interact, and that pores may contain a nutrient source. We propose that the different lacunar types reflect the stages of the tesserae formation process, while also representing local variation in tissue architecture and cell function. Lacunae are linked by small passages (canaliculi) in the matrix to form elongated series at the tesseral periphery and tight clusters in the center of tesserae, creating a rich connectivity among cells. The network arrangement and the shape variation of chondrocytes in tesserae indicate that cells may interact within and between tesserae and manage mineralization differently from chondrocytes in other vertebrates, perhaps performing analogous roles to osteocytes in bone.",,,,"; Dean, Mason/C-8758-2014","zaslansky, paul/0000-0002-8714-4992; Dean, Mason/0000-0002-5026-6216",,,,,,,,,,,,8756-3282,1873-2763,,,,MAY,2020,134,,,,,,,,115264,10.1016/j.bone.2020.115264,,,,,,,WOS:000527850700007,32058019,,,,,

Standard MRs of M. antarcticus and H. portusjacksoni were 168.5 +/- 61.9 mgO(2) kg(-0.67) h(-1) and 144.1 +/- 20.4 mgO(2)kg(-0.67) h(-1) , respectively.

The simulated gillnet-capture treatment decreased the MR of M. antarcticus by 59.3% and increased that of H. portusjacksoni by 21.6%. Our results confirm that M. antarcticus is highly sensitive to gillnet capture, exhibiting significant variability in MR among individuals and also a high delayed mortality rate. We interpret the decrease in MR as a compensatory mechanism for reducing oxygen consumption to cope with the stress imposed by capture. Mortality in this species was associated with higher pre-stress MR, and lower post-stress MR. In contrast, H. portusjacksoni showed mild increases in MR. Their resilience to capture stress most likely relies on effective buccal pumping and lower basal MR. A mixed-effects model approach permitted us to identify the main sources of variation in the MR measured, which were the individual differences, treatment effects, species variations and delayed mortality.

The discrete combination of hard and soft tissues is hypothesized to enhance the mechanical performance of tessellated cartilage (which performs many of the same functional roles as bone) by providing either rigidity or flexibility, depending on the nature of the applied load. These mechanisms and the effect of tesserae ultrastructure on cartilage mechanics, however, have never been demonstrated in the actual tissue, nor in bio-accurate models. Here, we develop bio-inspired three-dimensional tesserae computer models, incorporating material properties and ultrastructural features from natural tessellated cartilage. The geometries of ultrastructural features were varied parametrically, and the effective modulus of whole tesserae was evaluated using finite element analysis to determine the roles of ultrastructural features in mechanics. Whereas altering some structural features had no effect on the macroscopic in-plane modulus of tesserae, a three-fold increase in the contact surface area between two adjacent tesserae increased the effective modulus of tesserae by 6%. Modeled stress distributions suggest that tesseral 'spokes' (distinct hyper-mineralized features in tesserae) bear maximum stresses in the skeleton and serve to funnel stresses to particular populations of cells in tesserae, while spokes' lamellated structure likely helps dissipate crack energy, making tesserae more damage-tolerant. Simulations of multi-tesseral arrays showed that maximum stresses in tension and compression are borne by different tissues, supporting hypotheses of multi-functional properties of tessellated cartilage. Further, tesseral array models showed that minor alterations to tesserae/joint shape and/or material properties can be used to tune the mechanical behavior of the whole tiled composite. Our models provide the first functional understanding of the distinct morphologies of spokes and of 'stellate' tesserae (a tesseral shape observed first over 150 years ago), while also being useful drivers for hypotheses of growth, mechanics, load management, and the prevention and 'directing' of cracks in tessellated cartilage, as well as other biological composites.

The anatomical placement and operating temperatures of red muscle vary widely among teleosts: in tunas, the red muscle is located centrally in the body, adjacent to the spine, and maintains an elevated temperature. In the majority of ectothermic teleosts, red muscle is located laterally in the body, adjacent to the skin, and operates at ambient temperature. The specialized physiology and biomechanics of red muscle in tunas are often considered important adaptations to their high-performance pelagic lifestyle; however, the mechanics of how muscular work is transmitted to the tail remains largely unknown. The red muscle has a highly pennate architecture and is connected to the spine through a network of bones (epicentral bones) and long tendons (posterior oblique tendons). The network of long tendons has been hypothesized to enhance the power transmitted to the tail. Here, we investigate the morphology and biomechanics of the tuna's red muscle and tendons to determine whether elasticity is exploited to reduce the cost of transport, as is the case in many terrestrial vertebrates. To address this question, we evaluate two hypotheses: (1) tendons stretch during red-muscle-actuated swimming and (2) tendons comprise the primary load transmission pathway from the red muscle to the spine. To evaluate these hypotheses, we measured the mechanical properties of the posterior oblique tendons and performed novel dissections to estimate the peak force that the red muscle can generate. The force-generating capacity of the red muscle is calculated to be much greater than the load-bearing capacity of the posterior oblique tendons. Thus, the long tendons likely stretch under force from the red muscle, but they are not strong enough to be the primary force transmission pathway. These results suggest that other pathways, such as serial load transmission through the red muscle myomeres to the great lateral tendon and/or the anterior oblique tendons to the skin, transmit appreciable force to the tail.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1522-2152,1537-5293,,,,MAY 1,2020,93,3,,,,,185,198,,10.1086/708247,,,,,,,WOS:000525193300002,32196408,,,,,

From January to November 2014, four SDL were deployed 24 h per day, four days per week to target bull (Carcharhinus leucas) and tiger (Galeocerdo cuvier) sharks and to test the fishing efficacy of the SDL. Presence and residence time of 19 acoustically tagged bull and 19 tiger sharks, which had been tagged up to two years before the SDL deployment, were modelled against different SDL configurations, which included bait type and presence of bait or catches on the hooks, as well as environmental parameters before, during and after SLD deployment. There was insufficient acoustic data from the tiger sharks for any analyses. Bull sharks spent less time in nearshore waters when drumlines were deployed, and their presence was influenced by sea surface temperatures (SST), rainfall and time of day. There was no difference in the number of bull sharks detected in the SDL deployment area compared with surrounding sites. As SDL catch rates were only poorly correlated with presence of tagged sharks, their efficacy in catching sharks present in the area could not be accurately determined. Overall, the results show that SDL, deployed without chum and baited with small, whole, low-fat fish cannot be considered as shark magnets, which could attract dangerous bull sharks inshore where they would pose a threat to the safety of surfers and other sea users.

The exit of the embryonic intestine is maintained closed until close to birth, which allows the accumulation of faeces in the embryonic body. Faecal accumulation abilities are increased by (1) the large intestine size (represents about 400-600% of an adult intestine, proportionally), and (2) the modification in the intestinal inner wall structure, specialized to increase water uptake from the faecal matter. According to the literature, faecal accumulation may occur in embryos of the lamniform white shark as well. The reproductive biology of myliobatiform stingrays and lamniform sharks is characterized by the onset of oral feeding before birth (i.e. drinking of uterine milk and eating of sibling eggs, respectively), which is expected to result in the production of large amounts of faeces during gestation.

Successfully and non-destructively, addressing human-wildlife conflicts requires understanding of animal behavior. However, knowledge about white shark (Carcharodon carcharias) behavior near surf zones, where shark bites usually occur, is still limited. We used drones to obtain high-resolution tracks of 108 white sharks directly off coastal beaches on the east coast of Australia. White sharks ranged from 1.9 to 4.0 m (total length) and typically swam parallel to the beach line at an average speed of 0.82 m s(-1) (similar to 3.0 km h(-1)), with behavior being characteristic of energy conserving motion and foraging. Notably the presence of schools of fish increased mean swim speeds of sharks by 0.33 m s(-1) and caused tracks to be more convoluted. White sharks were also observed to swim straighter and faster with time either side of midday, increasing predicted mean swim speeds by 0.11 m s(-1), and net travel velocities by 0.25 m s(-1). White sharks also displayed inquisitive behavior toward various potential food and non-food items. We demonstrate that white sharks display largely predictable track trajectories and slow movement speeds along coastal beaches, which has utility in further developing non-destructive shark mitigation strategies. Whilst some of the behavior observed might support the exploratory bite hypothesis, there is likely an increased risk of a shark bite to bathers during situations where there are large shark-attracting food sources present.",,,,"Butcher, Paul/T-4367-2019; Pagendam, Daniel E/B-1683-2010","Butcher, Paul/0000-0001-7338-6037; Pagendam, Daniel E/0000-0002-8347-4767",,,,,,,,,,,,,2296-7745,,,,APR 28,2020,7,,,,,,,,268,10.3389/fmars.2020.00268,,,,,,,WOS:000529218400001,,,,,,

The high value marine tourism industry in Indonesia can create economic incentives for protecting and sustainably managing marine ecosystems and species, including sharks. This study estimates the economic value of shark and ray tourism in Indonesia and explores tourist preferences and local community perceptions of the tourism industry to understand the current and potential future role of this industry in shark and ray conservation. We identified 24 shark tourism hotspots across 14 provinces, with primary data collected from 365 tourists and 84 local community members over six case study sites. We use Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) and travel efforts to extrapolate expenditures to other tourism sites. We estimate that at least 188,931 dedicated or partially dedicated shark tourists visit Indonesia each year. The median annual expenditures of these shark tourists is estimated at USD 22 million (for 2017), accounting for at least 7% of the total USD 1 billion marine tourism revenue in Indonesia in 2017 and 1.45x the value of annual shark exports in the country (inflation-adjusted to 2017 values). If sharks were absent from the surveyed sites, Indonesia's tourism industry could lose similar to 25% of these dive tourist expenditures. Despite this considerable value, our study indicates a mismatch between the absolute economic value of shark and ray tourism and its role in providing an incentive for conservation. Results from interviews with local communities in or near shark and ray tourism sites indicate that shark fishers are not well placed to receive direct economic benefits from shark and ray tourism. Since overfishing is the primary threat to shark populations, failure to engage with and appropriately incentivize these stakeholders will be detrimental to the success of Indonesia's shark conservation efforts. If shark populations continue to decline due to insufficient conservation actions, the tourism industry could suffer economic losses from shark and ray tourism of more than USD 121 million per annum by 2027, as well as detrimental impacts on species, marine ecosystems, fisheries and people.",,,,,"Ichsan, Muhammad/0000-0002-8156-9666; Mustika, Putu/0000-0001-5157-4635",,,,,,,,,,,,,2296-7745,,,,APR 28,2020,7,,,,,,,,261,10.3389/fmars.2020.00261,,,,,,,WOS:000529217400001,,,,,,

Jamie F.",,,Implications of life history uncertainty when evaluating status in the Northwest Atlantic population of white shark (Carcharodon carcharias),ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,,,,,,,,,,,,"To effectively protect at-risk sharks, resource managers and conservation practitioners must have a good understanding of how fisheries removals contribute to changes in abundance and how regulatory restrictions may impact a population trajectory. This means they need to know the number of animals being removed from a population and whether a given number of removals will lead to population increases or declines. For white shark (Carcharodon carcharias), theoretical quantities like the intrinsic rate of population increase or rebound potential (ability to increase in size following decline) are difficult to conceptualize in terms of real-world abundance changes, which limits our ability to answer practical management questions. To address this shortfall, we designed a simulation model to evaluate how our understanding of longevity and life history variability of white shark affects our understanding of population trends in the Northwest Atlantic. Then, we quantified the magnitude of removals that could have caused historical population declines, compared these to biologically based reference points, and explored the removal scenarios which would result in population increase. Our results suggest that removals on the order of 100s of juveniles per year could have resulted in population-level declines in excess of 60% during the 1970s and 1980s. Conservation actions implemented since the 1990s would have needed to be nearly 100% effective at preventing fishing mortality in order for the population to double in abundance over the last 30 years. Total removals from all fleets needed to be exceptionally small to keep them below biological reference points for white shark in the Northwest Atlantic. The population's inherent vulnerability to fishing pressure reaffirms the need for restrictive national and international conservation measures, even under a situation of abundance increase.",,,,,"Bowlby, Heather/0000-0002-2532-3725",,,,,,,,,,,,2045-7758,,,,,JUN,2020,10,11,,,,,4990,5000,,10.1002/ece3.6252,,APR 2020,,,,,WOS:000528979700001,32551076,,,,,

The female reproductive cycle is asynchronous, and it seems to be annual, with a gestation period of 5-6 months, and a consecutive ovarian cycle and gestation period.

Results provide information on the hotspots dynamics of silky shark as well as its habitat preferences. Models detected a significant relationship between seasonal upwelling events, mesoscale features and silky shark presence and suggested strong interaction between productive systems and the spatial-temporal distribution of the species.

In Peru, the northern coast has been identified as the area with the highest presence of whale sharks, yet their ecology in this area is poorly defined. This study predicts the spatial distribution of whale sharks off coastal northern Peru (03 degrees 00 ' S-04 degrees 30 ' S) during La Nina and El Nino seasonal conditions, utilizing maximum entropy modelling. Between 2009 and 2018 (except for 2011), 347 whale sharks were geo-referenced in northern Peru with greatest data recordings in the austral summer and spring during La Nina events. Depth was the most important predictive variable for spatial distribution of whale sharks, followed by chlorophyll-a. Sharks were predicted in shallower coastal waters in which chlorophyll-a values are higher. Habitat suitability was higher in the northern coastal part of the study area. Spring presents the most suitable environmental conditions for whale sharks, both during La Nina and El Nino conditions. The probability of whale shark presence in the north of Peru increases at higher chlorophyll-a and sea surface temperature values. Therefore, whale sharks appear to aggregate seasonally in northern Peru, potentially exploiting rich foraging grounds. In these areas of high suitability, whale sharks are susceptible to fisheries, bycatch, ship collisions, unmanaged tourism, and pollution; thus, management actions should focus in these areas. This study represents a first step to understand the distribution and habitat suitability of whale shark in Peruvian waters. Further studies should identify suitable habitat for whale sharks in offshore areas. Also, these should focus on the connectivity of these aggregations with other localities in the south-eastern Pacific in order to contribute to regional strategies for the conservation of this iconic species in this particular region.",,,,,"Gonzalez Pestana, Adriana/0000-0001-9510-3966; Kelez, Shaleyla/0000-0003-3296-8721",,,,,,,,,,,,1052-7613,1099-0755,,,,JUL,2020,30,7,,,,,1325,1336,,10.1002/aqc.3330,,APR 2020,,,,,WOS:000527873900001,,,,,,

The objective of this study was to assess the extinction risk of all 10 wedgefishes and six giant guitarfishes by applying the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List Categories and Criteria, and to summarize the latest understanding of their biogeography and habitat, life history, exploitation, use and trade, and population status. Three of the 10 wedgefish species had not been assessed previously for the IUCN Red List. Wedgefishes and giant guitarfishes have overtaken sawfishes as the most imperilled marine fish families globally, with all but one of the 16 species facing an extremely high risk of extinction through a combination of traits: limited biological productivity; presence in shallow waters overlapping with some of the most intense and increasing coastal fisheries in the world; and overexploitation in target and by-catch fisheries, driven by the need for animal protein and food security in coastal communities and the trade in meat and high-value fins. Two species with very restricted ranges, the clown wedgefish (Rhynchobatus cooki) of the Malay Archipelago and the false shark ray (Rhynchorhina mauritaniensis) of Mauritania, may be very close to extinction.

The purpose of this paper is to determine to what extent, and under what circumstances, emotional appeals may be effective to convince the conversational partner in entrepreneurship discourse. Design/methodology/approach To examine the interaction between rational and emotional appeals this paper analyses a corpus formed by several examples of the elevator pitch genre, which have been taken from a TV programme called Tu Oportunidad (Your Chance), the Spanish counterpart of the British Dragon's Den and the American Shark Tank. Using the information gathered in the discursive analysis of the corpus, the paper establishes a template that identifies the main rational and emotional aspects that characterize the entrepreneurial pitch. In a second stage of the research, the template is used to conduct a quantitative analysis of the persuasive influence of rational and emotional aspects. Findings The results of the qualitative and quantitative research show that there is a clear correlation between the propensity to finance entrepreneurial ventures and the presence of rational aspects in the entrepreneurial pitch. The lack of rational arguments determines the failure of the entrepreneur's efforts to be persuasive, regardless of the emotional appeals that are introduced into the pitch. Emotional appeals prove to be useful to reinforce rational arguments but they are not sufficiently persuasive on their own.

We tested a genetic stock identification (GSI) workflow to quantify the relative contributions of different source populations of the CITES-listed scalloped hammerhead shark Sphyrna lewini to international trade hubs for products such as dried fins. We grouped published mitochondrial control region sequences from wild-captured sharks sampled in 15 locations into 9 differentiated populations that provide broad coverage of the species global distribution. GSI simulations established that these populations are highly identifiable and we trialed this approach to assess the provenance of processed fin trimmings collected randomly from the retail market of Hong Kong, one of the world's largest shark fin trade hubs in 2014-2015 (N = 72). In this pilot survey, we found over 75% of scalloped hammerhead fin trimmings came from two Pacific Ocean populations, but mostly from the Eastern Pacific (61.4%, of all trimmings; se 7.1%) where this species is listed as 'Endangered' under the United States Endangered Species Act. Six of the nine populations were found in this sample of the market, indicating near global sourcing of scalloped hammerhead fins in Hong Kong. We suggest technical and sampling considerations for employing GSI at fin trade hubs in the future to investigate regional sourcing of scalloped hammerheads and other coastal sharks in international trade.

Specimens comprised whole worms and free proglottids, both of varying degrees of maturity. This material allowed for the opportunity to examine in detail the developmental progression of this hyperapolytic lecanicephalidean species with regard to overall size, scolex dimensions, and microthrix pattern. Complete immature worms ranged in size from 2.4 nun to 14mm. The smallest scoleces were half as wide as larger scoleces and exhibited a much smaller ratio of apical organ width to bothridial width. Proglottids more than quadrupled in length during maturation from terminal attached immature to detached proglottids. In addition, a change in microthrix pattern was observed on the anterior region of the proglottids from immature to gravid proglottids; the anterior region of attached immature proglottids is covered with gladiate to coniform spinitriches with capilliform filitriches only rarely visible, whereas this region in detached proglottids is covered with gladiate to coniform spinitriches and conspicuous capilliform filitriches. This is the first report of A. japonica from outside Japan expanding its distribution south to Taiwan. In addition, a preliminary phylogenetic analysis of the genus is presented that suggests congeners from the same host species are not each other's closest relatives, nor is there an apparent phylogenetic signal for apical organ type or reproductive strategy (apolysis). However, reproductive strategy does seem to be correlated with host group such that euapolytic species parasitise dasyatid stingrays while hyperapolytic species parasitise either torpediniform rays or orectolobiform sharks.",,,,,", Kirsten/0000-0003-0294-8471",,,,,,,,,,,,0015-5683,1803-6465,,,,APR 16,2020,67,,,,,,,,6,10.14411/fp.2020.006,,,,,,,WOS:000526890500001,32350158,,,,,

Coprophagy-related scrape traces occur in different morphotypes and represent both invertebrate burrows and bite traces made by fishes. The mineralogical and chemical analyses indicate an early precipitation of phosphate and pyrite minerals, probably induced by the microbial community.

Measurements of retinal spectral sensitivity in juvenile sharks, made using single flash and heterochromatic flicker photometry under conditions of dark- or light-adaptation, indicated a peak sensitivity at around 500 nm, with no evidence of a spectral shift with increasing levels of light adaptation. Histological sections of the retina revealed a heavily rod dominated retina containing only a few small cell profiles in the photoreceptor layer that might represent a sparse cone population or may be immature rods. Assessment of retinal topography in juvenile sharks indicated the presence of a distinct specialisation for increased visual spatial acuity in the form of a horizontal streak of higher rod photoreceptor (similar to 80,000 rods mm(-2)) and ganglion cell (similar to 1,800 cells mm(-2)) densities across the horizontal meridian of the eye. This specialization would be adaptive for panoramic sampling of the part of the visual field corresponding to the substrate-water interface and remove the need for H. portusjacksoni to move its eyes extensively when resting on the sea floor. The estimated upper limit of spatial resolving power in juvenile H. portusjacksoni was 3.14 cycles deg(-1), which is at the lower end of values measured in elasmobranchs.

Cross-shelf differences in physical and biological properties of reefs can alter regional ecosystem processes resulting in different movement patterns for resident sharks. Passive acoustic telemetry was used to examine residency, space use and depth use of 40 blacktip reef sharks, Carcharhinus melanopterus, on an inshore reef in Queensland, Australia, and assess temporal or biological influences. All sharks showed strong site-attachment to inshore reefs with residency highest among adult females. Sharks exhibited a sex-based, seasonal pattern in space use where males moved more, occupied more space and explored new areas during the reproductive season, while females utilised the same amount of space throughout the year, but shifted the location of the space used. A positive relationship was also observed between space use and size. There was evidence of seasonal site fidelity and long-distance movement with the coordinated, annual migration of two adult males to the study site during the mating season.

Such displays are known to facilitate mate attraction or signal relationship quality. Across many taxa, synchronous male displays appear to be driven by competition, while synchronous displays in humans are thought to be unique in that they serve a cooperative function. Indeed, it is well established that human synchrony promotes cooperative endeavours and increases success in joint action tasks. We examine another system in which synchrony is tightly linked to cooperative behaviour. Male bottlenose dolphins form long-lasting, multi-level, cooperative alliances in which they engage in coordinated efforts to coerce single oestrus females. Previous work has revealed the importance of motor synchrony in dolphin alliance behaviour. Here, we demonstrate that allied dolphins also engage in acoustic coordination whereby males will actively match the tempo and, in some cases, synchronize the production of their threat vocalization when coercing females. This finding demonstrates that male dolphins are capable of acoustic coordination in a cooperative context and, moreover, suggests that both motor and acoustic coordination are features of coalitionary behaviour that are not limited to humans.",,,,"King, Stephanie/B-7229-2015","King, Stephanie/0000-0003-2293-9185",,,,,,,,,,,,0962-8452,1471-2954,,,,APR 8,2020,287,1924,,,,,,,,10.1098/rspb.2019.2944,,,,,,,WOS:000546947600009,32228413,,,,,

Information about its movements and habitat use is fragmentary and recent study showed that elemental signatures deposited in its vertebrae served as reliable site-specific markers. Age-related movements of S. lewini in the Mexican Pacific were examined using vertebral microchemistry. Vertebrae were obtained from 48 sharks captured in 2016. Elemental signatures were quantified using laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Spatial variability of the vertebral edge elemental signatures was first assessed to verify that microchemistry could distinguish among sharks based on recent habitat use before inferences on environmental histories could be made. Age-related movements were then assessed by quantifying changes in the Sr:Ca, Ba:Ca, Sr:Ba and Pb:Ca ratios along vertebral transects encompassing complete life histories. Analysis of elemental profiles suggested that S. lewini exhibits movements that are likely more plastic than previously assumed, with a stronger association to coastal habitats than expected. Females used highly variable habitats over their lifetime and males alternated between two migratory patterns, coastal or pelagic, as they either remained nearshore for their entire life or migrated offshore to later return to coastal habitats. Migratory contingents or partial migration might be a strategy of S. lewini to reduce vulnerability to stressors among regions.

This study provides new insights into young white shark diet in the North eastern Pacific Ocean using stable isotope analysis in muscle tissues. We analyzed delta C-13 and delta N-15 values of young white shark muscle (n=21) from Sebastian Vizcaino Bay (SBV) during 2015-2018. We found changes in prey composition across early [neonates, young-of-the-years (YOYs), juveniles] white shark life stages, with significant changes in isotopic composition throughout early ontogeny. Mixing model results indicate a high use of coastal areas for foraging, mainly for juvenile stages and the substantial contribution of pelagic preys (e.g., S. japonicus, Prionotus spp., Cynoscion spp., S. sagax, etc.) in YOYs, white shark diet also indicates an important role of offshore foraging. This change in isotopic composition likely represents the shift from the embryo's typical maternally derived isotopic signature, incorporated in offshore foraging regions, to the postpartum isotopic composition incorporated by foraging neonates in inshore nursery habitats.

Potential fecundity was estimated as 31,000-75,026 eggs, with a batch fecundity of 2,000-8,000 eggs. Six distinct developmental stages were observed in the eggs suspended in the A. nouryi shell. Our data indicate that the A. nouryi reproductive strategy includes continuous low batch spawnings, mating early in life, and sperm storage in the spermatheca.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1323-5818,1448-6067,,,,JUL 2,2020,40,3,,,,,205,213,,10.1080/13235818.2020.1748263,,APR 2020,,,,,WOS:000524661600001,,,,,,

Using remote video, we investigated interactions between giant manta rays (Mobula birostris) and cleaner wrasse at a seamount in the Philippines. Cleaning events occurred between 11:00 and 16:00 h on a seasonal basis and were constrained by current strengths and ambient water temperatures. The frequency with which giant manta rays interacted with cleaner fish varied on an individual basis. Blue streaked cleaner wrasse (Labroides dimidiatus) and moon wrasse (Thalassoma lunare) selectively foraged on manta rays' gills and pelvis, with L. dimidiatus also demonstrating slight preferences for the pectoral fins. Cleaners' foraging preferences may indicate ectoparasitic infections in specific areas of a manta ray's body. The exclusivity with which giant manta rays visited a particular cleaning station on the seamount may be a response to the quality of services that cleaners provide there. Giant mantas' fidelity to this site may also be attributed to localised concentrations of food that are available nearby. The seamount provides habitat that appears to be important to the life history strategies of the region's giant manta rays.",,,,,"Oliver, Simon/0000-0002-2975-1233",,,,,,,,,,,,0025-3162,1432-1793,,,,APR 7,2020,167,5,,,,,,,54,10.1007/s00227-020-3674-2,,,,,,,WOS:000524253000001,,,,,,

The whale shark, Rhincodon typus, is the largest fish in the world and is highly valued in the eco-tourism sector. Despite conservation concerns and advances in our understanding of their life history, basic demographic parameters for growth, longevity and mortality are of questionable accuracy; previous growth studies could not agree whether the vertebral growth bands were formed annually or biannually. Here, we provide the first validation of the annual formation of growth bands within the vertebrae of the whale shark using bomb radiocarbon assays. Ages of up to 50 years were estimated from sectioned vertebrae of sharks collected in Taiwan and Pakistan. There was no cessation of the formation of growth bands in the vertebrae of older sharks and our study provides the oldest observed longevity for this species.

The FA profiles of prey were compared with those of liver tissue of spawning-capable and post-spawning female albacore, using multivariate analysis. Whereas stomach content analysis identified cephalopods and crustaceans as the dominant prey items in number, FA-profile analysis identified crustaceans and fishes as the most-frequently consumed prey of post-spawning female albacore. In contrast, the FA profiles of spawning-capable albacore and those of prey showed very low similarity. Analysis of the prey suggests that although cephalopods, crustaceans and fishes could all provide albacore with the required lipids and FAs, cephalopod prey seem to be less desirable owing to their lower energy content (i.e. low in total lipid, triacylglycerol, 16:0, 18:0 and 18:1 omega 9). Instead, the most beneficial food appeared to be locally available fishes, which are more energy-rich and have a higher docosahexaenoic acid/ eicosapentaenoic acid ratio.

To gain insight into such patterns, we deployed a combination of acoustic (n = 21) and satellite (n = 12) tags on reef manta rays Mobula alfredi in the British Indian Ocean Territory Marine Protected Area (BIOT MPA) annually from 2013 through 2016. An extensive array of acoustic receivers (n = 52) were deployed across the archipelago to record the movements of mantas throughout the MPA. Data revealed large individual variation in horizontal movement patterns, ranging from high local site fidelity (<10 km) for up to 3 yr, to large-scale regional movements (>200 km) around the entire MPA. Depth time-series data recorded vertical movement patterns consistent with other epipelagic elasmobranch species, including oscillatory diving and deep dives to greater than 500 m. Though no individuals were directly recorded departing the MPA throughout the study, the gaps in detections and estimated travel speeds documented here indicate that movement of individuals outside of the BIOT MPA cannot be discounted. Collectively, our data suggests that, with effective enforcement, the current size of the BIOT MPA is providing substantial protection to its reef manta ray population.

We aimed to improve our understanding of population level movement for common thresher sharks Alopias vulpinus by leveraging the largest satellite tagging dataset available for this species. Using a Bayesian approach specifically designed to address population-level questions with sparse telemetry data, we identified that A. vulpinus off the west coast of North America are partial migrators which conditionally migrate, based on a combination of fixed intrinsic states (size, sex) and variable extrinsic states (e.g. season, environment). Waters of the Southern California Bight were identified as an area where, seasonally, a large variety of sizes of A. vulpinus can be found. While smaller juveniles can be found throughout the year, larger sub-adults and adults often move out of the Bight during certain seasons (spring and winter). Knowledge of how A. vulpinus distribute along the coast, and that season, size, and to some extent sex, play important roles in where and what type of animals are likely to be found, are key pieces of information when attempting to accurately characterize basic biological parameters like age, growth, and reproduction, as well as understanding the effects of variable fishing pressures across the species' range.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0171-8630,1616-1599,,,,APR 2,2020,639,,,,,,155,167,,10.3354/meps13271,,,,,,,WOS:000525359900010,,,,,,

In 2010, a cold snap across south Florida had wide-ranging impacts, including negative effects on recreational fisheries, agriculture, and ecological communities. Here, we use acoustic telemetry and historical longline monitoring to assess the long-term implications of this event on juvenile bull sharks Carcharhinus leucas in the Florida Everglades. Despite the loss of virtually all individuals (ca. 90%) within the Shark River Estuary during the cold snap, the catch per unit effort (CPUE) of age 0 sharks on longlines recovered through recruitment within 6-8 mo of the event. Acoustic telemetry revealed that habitat use patterns of age 0-2 sharks reached an equilibrium in 4-6 yr. In contrast, the CPUE and habitat use of age 3 sharks required 5-7 yr to resemble pre-cold snap patterns. Environmental conditions and predation risk returned to previous levels within 1 yr of the cold snap, but abundances of some prey species remained depressed for several years. Reduced prey availability may have altered the profitability of some microhabitats after the cold snap, leading to more rapid ontogenetic shifts to marine waters among sharks for several years. Accelerated ontogenetic shifts coupled with inter-individual behavioral variability of bull sharks likely led to a slower recovery rate than predicted based on overall shark CPUE. While intrinsic variation driven by stochasticity in dynamic ecosystems may increase the resistance of species to chronic and acute disturbance, it may also increase recovery time in filling the diversity of niches occupied prior to disturbance if resistive capacity is exceeded.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0171-8630,1616-1599,,,,APR 2,2020,639,,,,,,169,183,,10.3354/meps13269,,,,,,,WOS:000525359900011,,,,,,

Detailed measurements of their length show that they are exceptionally long and unusually continuous. The Great Southern Scarp is the southern edge of the Nullarbor Plain's Bunda Plateau; it is cut into shallow marine sediments and extends for 820 km. Once a continuous sea-cliff, local uplift has isolated two sections from the ocean, so it now comprises the Bunda Cliffs (210 km of coastal cliff, 180 km of which is uninterrupted cliff line), Hampton Range (inland; 300 km), Baxter Cliffs (160 km of coastal cliff) and Wylie Scarp (inland; 160 km). The Zuytdorp Cliffs are coastal cliffs cut into eolianite, and extend for 210 km with an uninterrupted section of 120 km. The length of the Great Southern Scarp and the Zuytdorp Cliffs results from an unusual combination of circumstances. They are both composed of poorly jointed, relatively homogenous biogenic calcarenites, presented to high-energy ocean waves by regional uplift. The carbonates are sufficiently well cemented to maintain a steep vertical cliff face, but susceptible to disintegration under direct wave attack. Cliff retreat has been fairly uniform because of the broad spatial scale of both lithology and erosion. The arid climate, absence of nearby non-karstic catchments and karstic nature of the cliffs' hinterlands has discouraged integrated drainage development, so no significant fluvial systems dissect the cliffs; this is a key factor in cliff edge preservation. In the case of the Great Southern Scarp, these processes have formed the longest continuous cliff line in Australia and probably the world. Referenced against criteria from Australia's National Heritage List, the cliffs have potentially international/national levels of significance for the rarity of their scale, their demonstration of landscape evolution, and their spectacular beauty.",,,,"Webb, John/B-2479-2012","Webb, John/0000-0002-6357-5966",,,,,,,,,,,,0812-0099,1440-0952,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1080/08120099.2020.1742202,,APR 2020,,,,,WOS:000523021400001,,,,,,

However, the recognized thermal habitats of these regional populations are poorly described. Here, we report the thermal range, catch frequency with bottom temperature, and catch frequency with time of year for both shark species in Narragansett Bay, Rhode Island. Additionally, we describe levels of two thermal stress response indicators, heat-shock protein 70 and trimethylamine N-oxide, with an experimental increase in water temperature from 15 degrees C to 21 degrees C. Our results show that S. acanthias can be found in this region year-round and co-occurs with M. canis from June to November. Further, adult S. acanthias routinely inhabits colder waters than M. canis (highest catch frequencies at bottom temperatures of 10 degrees C and 21 degrees C, respectively), but both exhibit similar upper thermal ranges in this region (bottom temperatures of 22-23 degrees C). Additionally, acute exposure to a 6 degrees C increase in water temperature for 72 hours leads to a nearly threefold increase in heat-shock protein 70 levels in S. acanthias but not M. canis. Therefore, these species display differences in their thermal tolerance and stress response with experimental exposure to 21 degrees C, a common summer temperature in Narragansett Bay. Further, in temperature-stressed S. acanthias there is no accumulation of trimethylamine N-oxide. At the whole-organism level, elasmobranchs' trimethylamine N-oxide regulatory capacity may be limited by other factors. Alternatively, elasmobranchs may not rely on trimethylamine N-oxide as a primary thermal protective mechanism under the conditions tested. Findings from this study are in contrast with previous research conducted with elasmobranch cells in vitro that showed accumulation of trimethylamine N-oxide after thermal stress and subsequent suppression of the heat-shock protein 70 response.",,,,"Camberg, Jodi/AAX-3737-2020",,,,,,,,,,,,,0006-3185,1939-8697,,,,APR 1,2020,238,2,,,,,131,144,,10.1086/708718,,,,,,,WOS:000536786800006,32412839,,,,,

Recently, marine organisms have been considered as promising sources of collagen, because they do not harbor transmissible disease. In particular, fish biomass as well as by-catch organisms, such as undersized fish, jellyfish, sharks, starfish, and sponges, possess a very high collagen content. The use of discarded and underused biomass could contribute to the development of a sustainable process for collagen extraction, with a significantly reduced environmental impact. This addresses the European zero-waste strategy, which supports all three generally accepted goals of sustainability: sustainable economic well-being, environmental protection, and social well-being. A zero-waste strategy would use far fewer new raw materials and send no waste materials to landfills.

The current study aimed to examine the spatial-temporal distribution of fishing effort and the catch levels obtained by the Venezuelan industrial multigear fishing fleet during the period 2015-2018. Fishing gear types employed by this fleet in order of preference were as follows: bottom longline (target sea catfishes [family Ariidae]), trap (target snappers [family Lutjanidae]), pelagic longline (target tunas [family Scombridae]), hand line (target mackerels [family Scombridae]), and shark longline (target sea catfishes and sharks [families Carcharhinidae, Squalidae, Sphyrnidae, Ginglymostomatidae, Alopiidae, and Triakidae]). The kernel intensity estimator determined that the main fishing area was the North Brazil Shelf (comprising 95% of the total fishing sets). Fishing effort (fishing sets per trip) distribution may be associated with oceanic fronts present in the region. A change in the dynamics of the fleet were recorded, with an increase in the use of bottom longlines, along with a decrease in the use of traps, possibly due to overfishing of resources caught by traps. The analyses of covariance showed a linear and positive relationship between the catch and fishing effort but with significant changes over the study period for traps and bottom longlines, since in the years where the fishing effort of traps was lower there were greater catches by unit of effort, and vice versa for bottom longlines, where lower catches by unit effort were obtained in years with greater effort.",,,,"Aguiar-Santos, Jamerson/W-9111-2018; Freitas, Carlos/F-1752-2014","Aguiar-Santos, Jamerson/0000-0003-4666-0226; Freitas, Carlos/0000-0001-5406-0998",,,,,,,,,,,,1942-5120,,,,,APR,2020,12,2,,,,,100,112,,10.1002/mcf2.10113,,,,,,,WOS:000529296400001,,,,,,

Simulated extinction scenarios forecast marked declines in functional richness if current trajectories are maintained during the next century (11% globally; up to 24% regionally), with more marked reductions (48% globally; up to 70% at the poles) beyond random expectations if all threatened species eventually go extinct.

Our sample includes 1793 galaxies at z < 0.11 observed with the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope, for which Sloan Digital Sky Survey spectroscopy and hierarchy information are also available. We find a cosmic III mass density of Omega(HI) = (3.99 +/- 0.54) x 10(-4) h(70)(-1) at < z > = 0.065. For the central and satellite galaxies, we obtain Omega(HI) of (3.51 +/- 0.49) x 10(-4) h(70)(-1) and (0.90 +/- 0.16) x 10(-4) h(70)(-1), respectively. We show that galaxies above and below stellar masses of similar to 10(9.3) M-circle dot contribute in roughly equal measure to the global value of Omega(HI). While consistent with estimates based on targeted III surveys, our results are in tension with previous theoretical work. We show that these differences are, at least partly, due to the empirical recipe used to set the partition between atomic and molecular hydrogen in semi-analytical models. Moreover, comparing our measurements with the cosmological semi-analytic models of galaxy formation SHARK and GALFORM reveals gradual stripping of gas via ram pressure works better to fully reproduce the properties of satellite galaxies in our sample than strangulation.

Such associations, if driven by an underlying proximate mechanism, could limit the independent evolution of each behaviour. In contrast, a behavioural syndrome may be the result of selection favouring the behavioural correlation under certain ecological circumstances. In this context, investigating the stability and the potential drivers of behavioural syndromes is a fundamental step towards understanding how they might shape the evolution of behaviours. We assessed syndrome stability across time in two subpopulations of free-ranging juvenile lemon sharks, Negaprion brevirostris. We measured two behaviours, exploration in an open field and sociability in a group, over 5 years. We tested whether these behaviours were associated in a behavioural syndrome, how stable this syndrome was and whether its strength was predicted by ecological conditions in this system: predator abundance, juvenile survival, newborn recruitment and total subpopulation size. We found that a behavioural syndrome was only observed in the subpopulation where predatory shark abundance was higher. Across years, newborn recruitment was the main driver for the strength of the syndrome. During years of low recruitment, the subpopulations probably experienced lower competition due to fewer newborns joining the population. In these years, sharks that were more explorative were also less social. These results indicate that the behaviours we tested were plastic and responsive to ecological conditions.

J,"Corsaro, D; Venditti, D",,,,"Corsaro, Daniele; Venditti, Danielle",,,Putative group I introns in the eukaryote nuclear internal transcribed spacers,CURRENT GENETICS,,,,,,,,,,,,"Group I introns are mobile genetic elements that interrupt genes encoding proteins and RNAs. In the rRNA operon, introns can insert in the small subunit (SSU) and large subunit (LSU) of a wide variety of protists and various prokaryotes, but they were never found in the ITS region. In this study, unusually long ITS regions of fungi and closely related unicellular organisms (Polychytrium aggregatum, Mitosporidium daphniae, Amoeboaphelidium occidentale and Nuclearia simplex) were analysed. While the insertion of repeats is responsible for long ITS in other eukaryotes, the increased size of the sequences analysed herein seems rather due to the presence of introns in ITS-1 or ITS-2. The identified insertions can be folded in secondary structures according to group I intron models, and they cluster within introns in conserved core-based phylogeny. In addition, for Mitosporidium, Amoeboaphelidium and Nuclearia, more conventional ITS-2 structures can be deduced once spacer introns are removed. Sequences of five shark species were also analysed for their structure and included in phylogeny because of unpublished work reporting introns in their ITS, obtaining congruent results. Overall, the data presented herein indicate that spacer regions may contain introns.",,,,,"Corsaro, Daniele/0000-0002-1754-1546",,,,,,,,,,,,0172-8083,1432-0983,,,,APR,2020,66,2,,,,,373,384,,10.1007/s00294-019-01027-0,,,,,,,WOS:000519454000011,31463775,,,,,

Thirty-eight percent of tiger sharks had at least one fisheries interaction resulting in retained hooks during the 8-year observation period. Both stainless-steel and corrodible hooks had a retention half-life of less than 1 year, and all corrodible hooks were shed within 2.5 years whereas firmly embedded stainless-steel hooks persisted for at least 7.6 years and are potentially retained for the lifetime of the shark. The presence of residual hooks and trailing line did not impact tiger shark growth suggesting that sharks were able to feed normally despite trailing gear. However, only a single internally-hooked sharks trailing line was observed suggesting their survival may perhaps be lower than externally-hooked individuals. Hook-retention data obtained from this study could be extrapolated to other warm water shark species that are difficult to observe in their natural habitats (e.g. oceanic whitetip shark, Carcharhinus longimanus).",,,,"Clua, Eric/D-7820-2013","Clua, Eric/0000-0001-7629-2685",,,,,,,,,,,,0165-7836,1872-6763,,,,APR,2020,224,,,,,,,,105462,10.1016/j.fishres.2019.105462,,,,,,,WOS:000514752000006,,,,,,

However, very few studies in the primary literature have quantified the effects of various TED design aspects affecting the escape of elasmobranchs. Data collected by observers on board commercial trawlers operating in Australia's northern prawn fishery (NPF) during 2001 were re-examined to quantify the effect of TEDs on catches of various elasmobranchs. During this sampling, a total of 6204 elasmobranchs were caught from 1440 net trawls. The 34 species identified, from 15 families and four taxonomic orders, were dominated by small carcharhinids (n = 2160, median total length = 75 cm) and dasyatids (n = 2030, median disc width = 24 cm). The TEDs assessed significantly reduced the numbers of large elasmobranchs caught: increasing fish size was found to result in higher escape for all taxonomic orders. Further, top-shooter TEDs increased the escape of Carcharhiniformes, while bottom-shooter TEDs facilitated greater escape of Myliobatiformes. Grid orientation had no effect on the escape of Orectolobiformes or Rhinopristiformes. Decreasing bar space was found to increase the escape of only one species, the Australian blacktip shark (Carcharhinus tilstoni). The TEDs facilitated the escape of several species of conservation interest including the globally endangered scalloped hammerhead (Sphyrna lewini) and zebra shark (Stegostoma fasciatum). However, the rostrum of the narrow sawfish (Anoxypristis cuspidata) inhibited the escape of this globally important species. Fishery-specific research is required to determine the appropriate TED bar spaces that reduce catches of elasmobranchs while minimising the loss of commercially important species.",,,,"Miller, Margaret J/D-2201-2011; Brewer, David/AAU-9486-2020","Miller, Margaret J/0000-0001-7798-7868; ",,,,,,,,,,,,0165-7836,1872-6763,,,,APR,2020,224,,,,,,,,105456,10.1016/j.fishres.2019.105456,,,,,,,WOS:000514752000011,,,,,,

While perturbing an input parameter, e.g. a cross section in a given energy range, the resulting perturbation to the effective cross section, e.g. multigroup cross section, can be expressed as the sum of an explicit and implicit component. The implicit term stems from changes in the neutron flux resulting from the cross section perturbation. This effect is neglected when using the standard perturbation theory methodology, even though its importance for uncertainty quantification is reported in the literature. The objectives of the paper are, in view of further enhancing Shark-X, to review a set of existing methods and to propose novel methodologies in order to accurately take the implicit effect into account in the resonance shielding treatment of CASMO-5; as well as to assess the importance of the new tool for typical LWR applications. Amongst the methods considered, those based on an equivalence in dilution allow perturbing the group-averaged cross sections without having to solve the slowing down problem in conjunction with the perturbed point-wise cross sections. However, such methods are found to show only limited improvements as compared to the standard perturbed self-shielded cross sections determined neglecting the implicit effect. As a result, a simpler approach based on the pre-determination of perturbation factors is adopted and implemented into Shark-X and CASMO-5. The new implementation is successfully tested and verified by comparing k-inf sensitivity coefficients computed with Shark-X with those from a Monte-Carlo reference solution, and this for a range of simple homogeneous mixtures as well as for LWR pin cells and lattices. Finally, the paper demonstrates through simple considerations, that the magnitude of the implicit effect is related to the energy group structure in the resolved resonance region, which might be specific to the code used to compute the sensitivity coefficients. The finer is the energy mesh; the smaller is also the impact of the implicit effect, and as such the necessity for a specific treatment. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

To quantify how disturbances interact with long-term directional changes (sea-level rise, freshwater restoration), we studied 17 yr of monthly dissolved organic carbon (DOC), total nitrogen (TN), and phosphorus (TP) concentrations and bacterioplankton productivity across freshwater-to-marine estuary gradients exposed to multiple disturbance events (e.g., droughts, fire, hurricanes, and low-temperature anomalies) and long-term increases in water levels. By studying two neighboring drainages that differ in hydrologic connectivity, we additionally tested how disturbance legacies are shaped by hydrologic connectivity. We predicted that disturbance events would interact with long-term increases in water levels in freshwater and marine ecosystems to increase spatiotemporal similarity (i.e., synchrony) of organic matter, nutrients, and microbial activities. Wetlands along the larger, deeper, and tidally influenced Shark River Slough (SRS) drainage had higher and more variable DOC, TN, and TP concentrations than wetlands along the smaller, shallower, tidally restricted Taylor River Slough/Panhandle (TS/Ph) drainage. Along SRS, DOC concentrations declined with proximity to coast, and increased in magnitude and variability following drought and flooding in 2015 and a hurricane in 2017. Along TS/Ph, DOC concentrations varied by site (higher in marine than freshwater wetlands) but not year. In both drainages, increases in TN from upstream freshwater marshes occurred following fire in 2008 and droughts in 2010 and 2015, whereas downstream increases in TP occurred with coastal storm surge from hurricanes in 2005 and 2017. Decreases in DOC:TN and DOC:TP were explained by increased TN and TP. Increases in bacterioplankton productivity occurred throughout both drainages following low-temperature events (2010 and 2011) and a hurricane (2017). Long-term TN and TP concentrations and bacterioplankton productivity were correlated (r > 0.5) across a range of sampling distances (1-50 km), indicating spatiotemporal synchrony. DOC concentrations were not synchronized across space or time. Our study advances disturbance ecology theory by illustrating how disturbance events interact with long-term environmental changes and hydrologic connectivity to determine the magnitude and extent of disturbance legacies. Understanding disturbance legacies will enhance prediction and enable more effective management of rapidly changing ecosystems.",,,,,"Castaneda, Edward/0000-0001-7759-4351; Kominoski, John/0000-0002-0978-3326",,,,,,,,,,,,0012-9658,1939-9170,,,,MAY,2020,101,5,,,,,,,,10.1002/ecy.2988,,MAR 2020,,,,,WOS:000521806700001,31958144,,,,,
